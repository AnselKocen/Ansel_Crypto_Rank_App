2025-08-07 14:41:50,49696671,1754577710,Australia records surge in investment scams,"The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has acquitted four individuals in Victoria for allegedly conducting money laundering offences linked to crypto scams. The authorities alleged that the individuals committed their offences between January and July 2021. The culprits include Dimitrios Podaridis, Bassilios Floropoulos, Peter Delis, and Harry Tsalikidis. ASIC revealed that the four facilitated scams targeted individual Australian investors offering fraudulent financial products, such as fraudulent bonds. Australia records surge in investment scams The government agency didn’t acknowledge whether the four were directly involved in operating the investment scams. It only stated that the individuals recklessly used the proceeds of crime without caring whether those funds were the proceeds of crime. According to ASIC, the culprits used fictitious investment websites and Facebook advertisements to attract investors. They allegedly offered investments ranging from 1-10 years with fixed returns between 4.5% and 9.5% per annum. The victims later deposited funds into Australian bank accounts operated and controlled by Delis, Floropoulos, and Podaridis. ASIC alleged that the trio moved the funds to offshore bank accounts and crypto exchanges. According to the independent commission, Tsalikidis also took part in similar activities and aided, abetted, or procured the rest. The agency started investigating the individuals following a tip-off from consumers and corporate and institutional entities. It did not disclose how much money was allegedly laundered by the four individuals or how many victims were affected. After completing its investigations, ASIC referred the matter to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. It also revealed that there will be a hearing of the matter on 30 October 2025 to decide whether the case will move to trial. Podaridis and Floropoulos were each charged with 28 counts of involvement in proceeds of indictable crime. Tsalikidis received 12 offences, while Delis was charged with eight counts of dealing in proceeds of indictable crime. Scamwatch reported a rise in investment scams in Australia, with hundreds of millions in lost savings each year. The firm said it received over 90,000 scam reports in 2025 alone. Those scams cost Australians roughly $98 million in losses, with almost half connected to investment scams. Scammers also stole nearly $213 million in 2024, mainly through fake investment schemes. Australia warns of rise in crypto ATM scams Australia’s financial crimes watchdog, AUSTRAC, also warned Australians in June of rising cases in crypto ATM scams. The agency’s CEO, Brendan Thomas, revealed that the task force surveilled customer activity for several months and found instances of scams, fraud, and other illegal activity. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) alleged that the 60 to 70-year-old age group had the most victims in the scam activity. That demographic accounted for 29% of all transactions by value on cryptocurrency ATMs. AUSTRAC said it’s working with authorities and crypto ATM providers to address the illegal activity. “This action draws a clear line in the sand and serves as a warning to other digital currency exchange providers that aren’t meeting their responsibilities under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.” -Brendan Thomas, CEO of AUSTRAC. The agency put several conditions to protect the financial system from suspicious activity, including a $5,000 limit on cash deposits and withdrawals. It also added customer due diligence obligations, scam warnings, and requirements for efficient transaction monitoring. AUSTRAC also urged cryptocurrency exchanges to consider imposing similar conditions to limit criminal exploitation. The agency argued it would reduce its exposure to money laundering and other serious crime risks. The Australian Cyber Security Center reported that Australians lost roughly $3 million to ATM scams last year. The agency also said it received more than 150 reports, including investment scams, extortion emails, and romance scams. It also alleged that the losses could be higher since many victims do not report such crimes. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

2025-08-07 14:40:11,49696511,1754577611,Trump’s Bold Choice: Christopher Waller Eyed for Federal Reserve Chair,"BitcoinWorld Trump’s Bold Choice: Christopher Waller Eyed for Federal Reserve Chair The financial world, including the ever-watchful cryptocurrency market, often keeps a close eye on shifts in Washington. Recent reports from Walter Bloomberg on X indicate a significant development: President Donald Trump’s inner circle is reportedly favoring Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller as the next Trump Fed Chair . This news could signal a pivotal change for US monetary policy and the broader economic landscape. Unpacking the Preference for Christopher Waller Who exactly is Christopher Waller , and why might he be the preferred candidate for such a crucial role? Waller currently serves as a Fed Governor , a position he has held since December 2020. Before joining the Board of Governors, he was the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, where he worked closely with then-President James Bullard. Background: Waller holds a Ph.D. in economics and has a strong academic and policy-making background. Economic Views: He is generally perceived as a proponent of a data-driven approach to monetary policy, often aligning with a more hawkish stance on inflation when necessary. Alignment: His past work and public statements suggest an economic philosophy that might resonate well with the Trump team’s outlook on growth and regulation. This preference highlights a strategic move to potentially align the central bank’s leadership with a specific economic vision. How Could This Impact the Federal Reserve? The role of the Federal Reserve chair is immensely powerful, shaping interest rates, controlling the money supply, and influencing global markets. A new chair, especially one with a clear mandate from a presidential administration, can steer the institution in a new direction. A change in leadership could: Shift Policy Stance: The Fed’s approach to inflation, employment, and financial stability might evolve. Influence Independence: While the Fed operates independently, a chair closely aligned with the executive branch could face questions about the central bank’s autonomy. Market Expectations: Investors and businesses will closely watch for signals on future interest rate paths and quantitative easing or tightening measures. Understanding these potential shifts is key for anyone tracking economic trends. Implications for US Monetary Policy and the Economy The selection of the next Trump Fed Chair carries significant weight for US monetary policy . This policy directly impacts everything from mortgage rates to business investments and even the value of the dollar. A new chair’s philosophy on managing inflation versus promoting employment can have far-reaching effects. Consider these potential implications: Interest Rates: Waller’s views could influence whether the Fed maintains, raises, or lowers interest rates in the coming years. Inflation Control: His approach to tackling inflation, a persistent concern, will be critical for economic stability. Market Volatility: Any perceived shift in the Fed’s independence or its commitment to its dual mandate (price stability and maximum employment) could introduce volatility into financial markets, including traditional assets and cryptocurrencies. These decisions directly affect the everyday financial lives of Americans and global economic stability. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities Assuming Christopher Waller is indeed nominated and confirmed, he would face a complex economic environment. The next Fed Governor will need to navigate ongoing inflation concerns, potential recession risks, and geopolitical uncertainties. Balancing the Fed’s dual mandate in such a climate presents both significant challenges and opportunities to shape the nation’s economic future. Inflation Management: Continuing the fight against persistent inflation while avoiding an economic downturn. Global Economic Headwinds: Responding to international economic pressures and maintaining financial stability. Technological Advances: Adapting monetary policy to new financial technologies, including digital currencies. The road ahead for the Federal Reserve is rarely smooth, requiring a steady hand and clear vision. In conclusion, the news that President Trump’s team favors Christopher Waller for the next Trump Fed Chair signals a potentially transformative period for the Federal Reserve and US monetary policy . As a current Fed Governor , Waller brings a specific set of economic perspectives that could redefine the central bank’s direction. Market participants and the public alike will keenly observe how this potential appointment unfolds and its subsequent impact on the economy and financial markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Christopher Waller? Christopher Waller is currently a Governor on the Board of the Federal Reserve System.

This strategic alliance reflects HTX’s ongoing mission to promote innovation and sustainable adoption in the crypto space. “At HTX, we believe stablecoins are central to the future of digital finance,” said Justin Sun , Advisor to HTX. “We are proud to support the development of USD1 and this groundbreaking loyalty program. As stablecoins become foundational in global trading, payments, and the on-chain ecosystem, we remain committed to driving their growth through reliable trading infrastructure, trusted partnerships, and forward-thinking initiatives.” Introduction to WLFI and USD1 World Liberty Financial (WLFI), founded by U.S. President Donald J. Trump (Co-Founder Emeritus), Steve Witkoff (Co-Founder Emeritus), Eric Trump , Donald Trump Jr. , Barron Trump , Zach Witkoff , Alex Witkoff , Chase Herro , and Zak Folkman , is a financial technology company at the forefront of merging digital asset innovation with American values and economic sovereignty. With deep-rooted connections to U.S. leadership, WLFI is driving a movement to establish stablecoins as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Its flagship asset, USD1 , exemplifies regulatory-grade compliance and financial integrity. USD1 stands out as a stablecoin that is fully backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents. This backing strategy is meticulously managed by WLFI to ensure that the value of USD1 remains tightly aligned with the U.S. dollar. With institutional-grade reserves and trusted custody partners, USD1 aims to become a foundational layer for digital payments, trading, and DeFi applications worldwide. USD1 Points Program Benefits The USD1 Points Program brings to crypto what loyalty programs have done for traditional industries like airlines, hotels, and credit cards. For the first time, stablecoin users can earn rewards for helping build a more sovereign and decentralized financial future. Through this program, HTX will enable users to earn points by trading USD1 pairs, holding USD1 in balances, and staking USD1 on the platform. Looking Ahead HTX is honored to join this movement alongside fellow industry leaders and support the growth of the USD1 stablecoin. This collaboration marks another milestone in HTX’s commitment to bringing secure, innovative, and user-focused products to the global crypto community.

We want to thank BlackRock for their collaboration and execution, and we look forward to growing this partnership over time.” LendingClub has sold nearly $6 billion in loans via its structured certificates programs since rolling out the offerings in 2023, according to a press release from the firm.

2025-08-07 14:30:11,49696105,1754577011,Paxos Settlement: A Staggering $48.5 Million Fine Signals Tougher Crypto Regulation,"BitcoinWorld Paxos Settlement: A Staggering $48.5 Million Fine Signals Tougher Crypto Regulation The crypto world is buzzing with news of a significant development: a staggering Paxos settlement . Paxos Trust Company recently agreed to pay $48.5 million to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This substantial fine addresses critical anti-money laundering (AML) and due diligence failures. These issues were specifically linked to its Binance partnership , highlighting the increasing scrutiny from regulators. This event sends a clear message about the growing importance of robust AML compliance within the digital asset space and signals a tightening grip on crypto regulation . Indeed, it underscores the need for every entity in this innovative sector to prioritize regulatory adherence. Why Did Paxos Face This Staggering Settlement? Paxos, a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform and issuer of stablecoins, found itself under the microscope for shortcomings in its compliance programs. The NYDFS investigation revealed that the company did not adequately monitor its transactions or conduct proper due diligence on its customers. This was particularly true concerning its collaboration with Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The lapses identified included: Insufficient Customer Due Diligence: Paxos reportedly failed to properly vet customers onboarded through its extensive Binance partnership . Inadequate Transaction Monitoring: The systems in place did not effectively detect or flag suspicious activities, which is a core requirement of modern crypto regulation . Failure to Timely Report Suspicious Activity: Delays in reporting potential illicit transactions further exacerbated the issue. This series of failures ultimately led to the substantial financial penalty. It underscores the critical need for strict financial oversight , even for established players in the crypto industry. The Crucial Role of AML Compliance in Crypto Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations are designed to prevent illicit activities, such as fraud, terrorist financing, and market manipulation. For cryptocurrency firms, adhering to these rules is not just a legal obligation; it is fundamental for maintaining trust and legitimacy within the global financial system. The Paxos case serves as a potent reminder that firms handling digital assets must implement comprehensive AML frameworks. This includes rigorous “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedures, which verify user identities, and continuous transaction monitoring to spot unusual patterns. Neglecting these aspects can lead to severe penalties, as seen with the Paxos settlement , and significant reputational damage. Moreover, robust AML compliance practices protect users by ensuring a safer ecosystem, aligning with the broader goals of effective crypto regulation . How Does This Impact Broader Crypto Regulation? This Paxos settlement is more than just a single enforcement action; it signals a broader, intensifying trend in the global regulatory landscape. Authorities globally are intensifying their focus on digital asset companies, pushing for greater transparency and accountability. The NYDFS, a leading financial regulator, is setting a clear precedent here. Their actions indicate a firm commitment to ensuring that crypto businesses operate under the same high standards as traditional financial institutions. This move is a clear indicator of evolving crypto regulation and the growing demand for enhanced financial oversight across the entire digital asset ecosystem. It suggests that regulators are moving beyond initial warnings to concrete enforcement, shaping the future of digital finance. Actionable Insights for Strengthening Financial Oversight What can other crypto companies, especially those with complex Binance partnerships or similar arrangements, learn from the Paxos experience? Proactive measures are key to avoiding similar fates. Prioritize Robust AML Frameworks: Implement and regularly update comprehensive AML policies and procedures. These should be dynamic and adapt to new risks, ensuring strong AML compliance . Enhance Due Diligence: Go beyond basic checks. Thoroughly understand your customers and their activities, especially in high-risk partnerships. This includes source of funds and wealth checks, critical for effective financial oversight . Invest in Technology: Utilize advanced, AI-driven tools for transaction monitoring, anomaly detection, and sanctions screening. Technology can significantly bolster AML compliance efforts. Conduct Regular Independent Audits: Independent reviews help identify weaknesses in compliance programs before regulators do. These audits provide an objective assessment of your adherence to crypto regulation . Foster a Culture of Compliance: Ensure all employees, from top management to entry-level staff, understand and commit to regulatory requirements. Regular training is essential for upholding strong financial oversight . Maintain Open Communication with Regulators: Proactive engagement can help clarify expectations and address potential issues before they escalate. The $48.5 million Paxos settlement with the NYDFS is a landmark event. It powerfully reinforces the imperative for strong AML compliance and vigilant financial oversight across the cryptocurrency sector. As the industry matures, regulators will continue to demand higher standards, ensuring market integrity and investor protection. This case serves as a crucial wake-up call, urging all crypto businesses to proactively strengthen their compliance measures and adapt to the evolving landscape of crypto regulation . The message is clear: compliance is not optional; it is foundational for sustainable growth in the digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Paxos settlement about? The Paxos settlement involves Paxos Trust Company paying $48.5 million to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for anti-money laundering (AML) and due diligence failures linked to its partnership with Binance. 2. What constitutes AML failures in the crypto industry? AML failures typically include inadequate customer due diligence, insufficient transaction monitoring, and delays in reporting suspicious activities, all of which violate regulations designed to prevent illicit financial flows. 3. How does this settlement impact the Binance partnership specifically? The settlement highlights that Paxos’s AML and due diligence shortcomings were specifically tied to its Binance partnership , indicating a need for more robust controls when collaborating with large, global exchanges. 4. What are the broader implications for crypto regulation? This case signals a tightening of crypto regulation globally, emphasizing that regulators expect digital asset companies to adhere to the same high standards of compliance and financial oversight as traditional financial institutions. 5.

2025-08-07 14:29:27,49696139,1754576967,US politician files $380K of leveraged bets against the US economy,"North Carolina Representative Tim Moore has filed a series of trades totaling up to $380,000 in triple-leveraged ETF positions most notably in Direxion’s Daily Small Cap Bull 3X ETF ( TNA ), according to public filings dated August 4, 2025. The trades span four consecutive purchase dates July 3, 9, 10, and 11 each falling into the $15,001–$50,000 range. If fully maxed, the filings picked up by Finbold’s political stock trading tracker represent $200,000 in TZA purchases alone. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal However, there’s a critical discrepancy: while the filings list the Bull 3X ETF, the ticker TZA actually refers to Direxion’s Bear 3X ETF, which profits when small-cap stocks decline. It’s unclear whether Moore intended to go long or short on small caps, or whether the disclosure contains a clerical error. Trades we expect from day traders, not lawmakers Moore’s filing is raising eyebrows, not just for its leveraged nature, but for its timing and aggressiveness. TZA is a high-risk product designed for short-term directional bets, often used by institutional traders to hedge volatility or capitalize on sharp market corrections. Adding to the confusion, Moore is also known to hold large positions in triple-leveraged bull ETFs, further complicating the intent behind these moves. It’s unusual, if not reckless, for a sitting Congressman to make this kind of bet. These are not buy-and-hold positions. It raises ethical questions about whether lawmakers are using their privileged access to economic insights to make short-term trades. Fed policy in focus Some market watchers speculated online that Moore’s trades may not necessarily be “bets against the economy,” but rather a hedge against monetary policy outcomes. One comment reads: “This isn’t a bet against the economy. It’s a bet that the Fed won’t cut rates. If lending dries up and rate cuts are delayed, small caps suffer.” Still, the lack of clarity, and the mislabeling of a bull fund as a bear fund (or vice versa) underscores the urgent need for stricter financial transparency rules for elected officials.

2025-08-07 14:27:36,49696076,1754576856,HTX Partners with World Liberty Financial to Support USD1 Points Program,"Panama, August 2025 — HTX, a global leading cryptocurrency exchange, is proud to announce its partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), becoming one of the esteemed launch partners for the USD1 Points Program — the world’s first global loyalty initiative built exclusively around the USD1 stablecoin. As one of the pioneering exchanges to collaborate with WLFI— and notably, the first exchange globally to list USD1 — HTX reaffirms its commitment to advancing a compliant, user-centric stablecoin ecosystem. This strategic alliance reflects HTX’s ongoing mission to promote innovation and sustainable adoption in the crypto space. “At HTX, we believe stablecoins are central to the future of digital finance,” said Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX. “We are proud to support the development of USD1 and this groundbreaking loyalty program. As stablecoins become foundational in global trading, payments, and the on-chain ecosystem, we remain committed to driving their growth through reliable trading infrastructure, trusted partnerships, and forward-thinking initiatives.” Introduction to WLFI and USD1 World Liberty Financial (WLFI), founded by U.S. President Donald J. Trump (Co-Founder Emeritus), Steve Witkoff (Co-Founder Emeritus), Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Barron Trump, Zach Witkoff, Alex Witkoff, Chase Herro, and Zak Folkman, is a financial technology company at the forefront of merging digital asset innovation with American values and economic sovereignty. With deep-rooted connections to U.S. leadership, WLFI is driving a movement to establish stablecoins as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Its flagship asset, USD1, exemplifies regulatory-grade compliance and financial integrity. USD1 stands out as a stablecoin that is fully backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents. This backing strategy is meticulously managed by WLFI to ensure that the value of USD1 remains tightly aligned with the U.S. dollar. With institutional-grade reserves and trusted custody partners, USD1 aims to become a foundational layer for digital payments, trading, and DeFi applications worldwide. USD1 Points Program Benefits The USD1 Points Program brings to crypto what loyalty programs have done for traditional industries like airlines, hotels, and credit cards. For the first time, stablecoin users can earn rewards for helping build a more sovereign and decentralized financial future. Through this program, HTX will enable users to earn points by trading USD1 pairs, holding USD1 in balances, and staking USD1 on the platform. Looking Ahead HTX is honored to join this movement alongside fellow industry leaders and support the growth of the USD1 stablecoin. This collaboration marks another milestone in HTX’s commitment to bringing secure, innovative, and user-focused products to the global crypto community.

2025-08-07 14:26:55,49695998,1754576815,Ripple CEO Reacts As Ripple Seals Fresh Acquisition to Dominate Stablecoin Industry,"Ripple has confirmed the acquisition of Rail, a Toronto-based stablecoin payments platform, in a strategic move aimed at expanding its institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure. The deal, reportedly valued at $200 million, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to standard regulatory approvals and closing conditions. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the acquisition is intended to position the company as the primary provider of stablecoin payment infrastructure for financial institutions globally. No such thing as the August doldrums at @Ripple …very excited to share that we’re acquiring @RailFinancial ! Ripple + Rail together will be THE go-to provider of stablecoin payments infrastructure for global financial institutions around the world. https://t.co/JzUoHjulZB — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 7, 2025 Scope of the Deal and Functional Objectives The acquisition enables Ripple to integrate Rail’s key technological offerings, which include virtual accounts, stablecoin on- and off-ramps, and automated back-office infrastructure. These services will streamline payment operations for clients, particularly institutional users operating across jurisdictions. Rail’s infrastructure already supports approximately 10 percent of global stablecoin transaction volume, making it one of the most active platforms in this segment. With this deal, Ripple is now positioned to deliver a unified crypto payment infrastructure capable of operating 24/7 across a wide range of assets. The integration will enable payments to be processed using Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD and XRP, in addition to other digital currencies. XRP will continue to serve as a key bridge asset within Ripple’s payment framework, reinforcing its relevance within the company’s cross-border solutions. Strengthening Ripple’s Institutional Offerings The Rail acquisition comes on the heels of Ripple’s earlier purchase of Hidden Road , a multi-asset prime brokerage platform, for approximately $1.25 billion. These moves form part of Ripple’s broader institutional strategy, which includes pursuing a national banking license and deepening its involvement in stablecoin and crypto infrastructure development. By consolidating Rail’s platform capabilities, Ripple aims to provide financial institutions with end-to-end tools that eliminate the need to manage wallets or engage in direct on-chain operations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The combined infrastructure from both companies will allow enterprise clients to access stablecoin payment flows through a single API, simplifying integration while maintaining regulatory compliance. Additionally, the back-office automation tools provided by Rail are expected to optimize liquidity management and improve the speed and transparency of fund settlement. Market Implications and Ecosystem Positioning This acquisition comes at a time when the digital asset industry is undergoing regulatory normalization, particularly in the United States. As legislative frameworks around stablecoins become more defined, the role of compliant infrastructure becomes increasingly critical for institutional players. Ripple’s continued investments indicate a strategic commitment to capturing market share within this segment by delivering solutions aligned with evolving regulatory standards. Crypto investor 24HRSCRYPTO commented on the development, highlighting the company’s aggressive strategy in building foundational stablecoin infrastructure ahead of broader market adoption. The comment reflects a growing sentiment among digital asset stakeholders that Ripple is establishing itself early in what could become a multi-trillion-dollar payment segment. Ripple’s acquisition of Rail reflects not only a technical consolidation but also a calculated expansion aimed at redefining how stablecoin infrastructure is deployed for global financial entities.

2025-08-07 14:25:10,49695927,1754576710,ProShares Leveraged ETF Unleashes Bold New Crypto Investing Opportunity,"BitcoinWorld ProShares Leveraged ETF Unleashes Bold New Crypto Investing Opportunity Exciting news is rippling through the financial world, especially for those keen on crypto investing . Global asset manager ProShares has just launched a groundbreaking product: the Ultra CRCL ETF, known as CRCA. This isn’t just any fund; it’s a ProShares leveraged ETF designed to deliver double the daily performance of Circle’s stock. This move marks a significant moment, offering a dynamic new avenue for traders to engage with the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Unpacking the ProShares Leveraged ETF (CRCA): What You Need to Know The Ultra CRCL ETF (CRCA) made its debut shortly after Circle stock began trading on the NYSE, where its shares saw an impressive 134% surge. This ProShares leveraged ETF aims to provide 2x the daily return of Circle’s stock, making it particularly attractive for short-term traders. These traders are looking to amplify their exposure to Circle, especially given the surging adoption of the USDC stablecoin and the ongoing development of stablecoin regulations. Understanding the mechanism behind CRCA is crucial. It’s built for daily performance, meaning its returns reset each day. While this offers significant upside potential for nimble traders, it also carries inherent risks, particularly over longer holding periods due to compounding effects. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and trading strategy carefully. Why the Buzz Around Circle Stock and USDC Stablecoin? Circle, the issuer behind the USDC stablecoin , is a major player in the digital economy. USDC’s growth has been phenomenal, establishing itself as one of the most widely used and regulated stablecoins globally. Its increasing utility in decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and Web3 applications underscores its importance. Consequently, exposure to Circle stock offers a direct way to participate in the growth of this vital infrastructure. The introduction of CRCA also reflects the broader institutional interest in providing structured products for crypto investing . As the regulatory landscape for digital assets matures, more traditional financial instruments are emerging, bridging the gap between conventional markets and the crypto world. This trend is crucial for expanding accessibility and legitimacy for digital assets. Navigating Leveraged Trading: Opportunities and Risks for Crypto Investors Leveraged trading allows investors to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital, effectively magnifying potential gains. For short-term traders eyeing the volatility and growth potential of Circle stock , a 2x leveraged ETF like CRCA presents a compelling opportunity. Imagine capturing double the daily upside during a strong market rally – the appeal is clear. However, it’s vital to acknowledge the flip side. Just as gains are amplified, so too are losses. If Circle’s stock experiences a downturn, CRCA would reflect double that loss daily. This makes it a high-risk, high-reward instrument, best suited for experienced traders who understand the intricacies of leveraged products and market dynamics. Diligent risk management and a clear exit strategy are paramount when engaging in leveraged trading . What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investing? The launch of the ProShares leveraged ETF signifies a growing trend towards more sophisticated and diverse investment vehicles in the crypto space. It indicates that traditional finance is finding innovative ways to offer exposure to digital assets, even those linked to specific companies rather than direct cryptocurrencies. This development could pave the way for more specialized ETFs and financial products, broadening the scope of crypto investing . Furthermore, it highlights the increasing confidence in regulated entities like Circle and their underlying assets. As the adoption of USDC stablecoin continues to accelerate globally, products like CRCA offer investors a unique, albeit high-risk, method to capitalize on this growth without directly holding the underlying shares or stablecoins themselves. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Crypto Market Exposure The Ultra CRCL ETF (CRCA) by ProShares is a significant addition to the investment landscape, offering a potent tool for those seeking amplified exposure to Circle stock . While it presents exciting opportunities for short-term traders due to its 2x daily leverage, it also demands a thorough understanding of its risks. As USDC stablecoin adoption grows and the regulatory environment evolves, such products will likely become more common, reshaping how we approach crypto investing . Always remember to conduct your own research and consider professional financial advice before engaging in leveraged products. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a leveraged ETF like CRCA? A leveraged ETF aims to amplify the daily returns of an underlying asset. CRCA specifically seeks to deliver 2x the daily performance of Circle’s stock, meaning it aims to double the daily gains or losses of Circle shares. What are the main risks of investing in the ProShares leveraged ETF (CRCA)? The primary risk is amplified losses. If Circle’s stock declines, CRCA will lose twice that amount daily. Additionally, due to daily rebalancing, its performance over longer periods may deviate significantly from 2x the underlying asset’s performance. How does CRCA relate to the USDC stablecoin? CRCA tracks the stock of Circle, which is the issuer of the USDC stablecoin . Therefore, the ETF provides indirect exposure to the company behind one of the world’s leading stablecoins, allowing investors to potentially benefit from Circle’s growth driven by USDC adoption. Who is the target audience for this Circle stock ETF? CRCA is primarily designed for short-term traders who understand the complexities of leveraged products and the volatility of the underlying asset. It is not intended for long-term buy-and-hold investors. Can I lose more than my initial investment with a leveraged ETF? No, typically you cannot lose more than your initial investment in a leveraged ETF, as they are structured as exchange-traded funds. However, significant losses can occur rapidly, potentially wiping out your entire investment if the market moves against your position.

He will pay a fine of $26.5 million! The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced that it has reached a settlement with Paxos Trust, a stablecoin issuer under investigation for allegedly violating anti-money laundering laws. Under this agreement, Paxos will pay a $26.5 million fine for failing to conduct adequate due diligence and for systemic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering program. In addition to the $26.5 million penalty, Paxos agreed to invest an additional $22 million to improve its compliance program and address deficiencies, according to a plan approved by the NYDFS. “After receiving regulatory approval to operate as a virtual asset company in 2015, Paxos jointly issued the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin with Binance. Paxos failed to do so, despite Binance being required by law to conduct regular due diligence and risk management. Approximately $1.6 billion (approximately 2.1 trillion won) worth of virtual asset transactions processed by Binance between 2017 and 2022 were associated with addresses involved in illicit activities,” NYDFS explained.

2025-08-07 14:21:54,49696232,1754576514,Union Jack Oil taps Reabold Resources to mine Bitcoin in partnership with 360 Energy,"Union Jack Oil plc and Reabold Resources have collaborated with 360 Energy to mine Bitcoin using freely available gas at the Newton gas field in the UK. The strategic plan involves deploying on-site data centers powered by electricity converted from natural gas. Union Jack Oil plc revealed that the approach would deliver a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy. The joint venture is operated under Rathlin Energy Ltd, which has already completed the feasibility study. The study supports the possibility of early-stage Bitcoin mining operations using gas produced from existing wells. Union Jack Oil owns 16.665% of the PEDL183, which includes the West Newton gas fields. West Newton gas field powers new Bitcoin mining operation Rathlin Energy will work on behalf of the joint venture under a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) with Texas-based firm 360 Energy to power a Bitcoin mining plant. The mining plant will receive power directly from gas extracted from the WNA-2 well at the West Newton A site. 360 Energy will utilize in-field computing (IFC) technology to convert natural gas into electricity to power the data centers on-site. #ujo $ujo West Newton Update *Gas to be produced from the existing discovery wells to generate on-site electricity to power cryptocurrency mining activities *Non-binding Letter of Intent with Texas-based, 360 Energy Inc. to design a Bitcoin mining solution at West… pic.twitter.com/0LryvxibU8 — Union Jack Oil plc (@UnionJackOilplc) August 7, 2025 According to the proposed feasibility study , the mining operations will target gas volumes that are currently abandoned and cannot be economically transported or sold via traditional channels. The collaboration aims to generate an alternative revenue stream without a fully developed gas infrastructure. David Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack Oil, said the asset holds material value and could deliver a substantial onshore low-carbon gas sale into the UK’s domestic market. He added that the move shows the company’s intention to extract value from West Newton’s gas reserves while navigating the challenging regulatory landscape in the onshore gas sector. An analysis report by the Texas-based 360 Energy revealed that crypto mining offers a more immediate solution by providing a more straightforward path to monetize smaller volumes of gas that would otherwise go unused. 360 Energy combines its experience from using IFC technology in the U.S to power similar off-grid Bitcoin mining data centers. The IFC technology offers a modular and portable nature of installations, allowing for rapid deployment and scalability. Bitcoin mining is an alternate revenue stream for energy firms Union Jack Oil revealed that a successful deployment of the initial project could pave the way for further mining operations across the field. West Newton gas field reportedly contains nearly 200 billion cubic feet of recoverable gas. The petroleum products firm has also hinted that the partnership could evolve into a formal Bitcoin treasury , allowing it to hold mined cryptocurrency as a financial asset. Increased scrutiny and regulation across the natural gas industry have made traditional pathways for monetization challenging. Rising gas volumes, limited pipeline capacity, and strict environmental policies in the U.S. have led producers to seek alternative revenue streams such as Bitcoin treasuries. Some analysts have noted that such projects have remained rare in the UK energy sector, making the collaboration a pilot test for similar ventures. 360 Energy will provide technical and operational support for the project. As the partnership grows, more details will follow. According to an analysis report by ez blockchain, Brent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh, A&M alumni, founded Energy Slutions in 2019 to mine Bitcoin using freely available natural gas. Their solution utilized wasted flare gas to generate electricity for mining, which helped cut emissions by 63%. Today, the gas is converted into electricity to power mining units on-site through transformations.

2025-08-07 14:18:06,49695706,1754576286,XRP Price Prediction: Japan’s First Bitcoin-XRP ETF Set to Launch – Is This the Trigger for $100 XRP?,"XRP (XRP) has regained momentum today, breaking back above the $3 mark after a major Japanese asset management firm confirmed plans to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the token. The news strengthens a bullish XRP price prediction , with expectations of rising trading volume from both retail and institutional investors in Japan. SBI Holdings, a financial titan that manages over $70 billion in assets in the Asian country, shared its plans in a presentation published days ago. Their goal is to launch two ETFs in Japan that offer exposure to specific crypto assets. The first is a Gold and Crypto Assets ETF that will invest 49% of its assets in Bitcoin (BTC) and the other will be a Bitcoin and XRP ETF that will offer exposure to these two tokens via a trust. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Hits Key Resistance Once Again and Could Rally to $3.3 Trading volumes for XRP in the past 24 hours do not show any exaggerated reaction to the news. However, this kind of development favors a bullish XRP price prediction as it will drive higher volumes toward the Ripple network and will open up the floodgates for further institutional interest. XRP has bounced decisively off the $2.75 level on the 4-hour chart and is now testing key resistance around $3.05. The price initially pulled back after hitting this zone, but a quick recovery has brought it back for a second test – a setup that raises the likelihood of a bullish breakout, especially with trading volumes climbing above average. A clean move above $3.10 could spark a sharper rally through the rest of the day, potentially pushing XRP toward $3.30 within 24 hours. While $100 remains out of reach for now, a surge toward $10 or beyond isn’t off the table, given the strong wave of bullish sentiment sweeping across the crypto market. Alongside major tokens, some of the best crypto presales like TOKEN6900 ($T6900) could offer even greater upside, as investors search for the next 10x opportunity in this cycle. Token6900 (T6900) Raises $1.7M to Launch the Purest Meme Coin Out There Token6900 ($T6900) is what happens when you stare at charts for too long and something looks back at you. This token has no roadmap, no use case, makes no promises, and offers no guarantees. That’s what makes it so special. It is the purest meme coin you’ll find in a market, fueled by pure ‘vibe liquidity’ and a deep desire to pay off your student loans and retire early. $T6900 is hard capped at $5 million. Those who believe will reap the highest returns. If you are tired of overtrading, watching dog-themed coins blow up in front of your eyes, and being rug-pulled, this is home. With a touch of 2000s nostalgia, T6900 leverages the success of other similar assets like SPX6900 (SPX) to give investors a way to break the cycle. To buy $T6900, simply head to the Token6900 website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

2025-08-07 14:13:49,49696231,1754576029,Oil supply consistently fall short as OPEC+ members struggle to fill new output quota,"OPEC+ said it would boost production to meet the world’s rising need for oil, but the barrels aren’t showing up. Since April, the group’s eight major producers have been trying to lift output in phases, aiming to add 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) by September compared to March levels. But data shows that the increase is out of reach, according to Reuters. Some countries can’t produce more. Others are being told to cut back for breaking the rules in past months. Either way, the result is a tight market where prices are going up, not down. The group’s internal punishment system is also slowing things down. Iraq and Russia are producing less because they previously overshot their limits. Kazakhstan is already pumping at full throttle. So far, oil futures haven’t dropped despite the scheduled increases. Instead, Brent crude went from $58 per barrel in April to $68 in August. Saudi lifts output while others hold back or hit capacity Saudi Arabia has done most of the work. Between April and June, the eight producers pledged to add 960,000 bpd. After subtracting production curbs still in place, the actual increase targeted was 730,000 bpd. But the real growth hit only 540,000 bpd, and 70% of that came from Saudi alone. Exports rose just 460,000 bpd between March and June. The International Energy Agency said global demand jumped by a full million bpd in the same window. So demand grew faster than supply. Saudi’s shipments alone rose by 631,000 bpd from March to June, while exports from Russia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, and Oman fell, according to Vortexa. Even though Riyadh went over its June quota, it said the extra barrels went into storage both inside and outside the country. China’s demand is another piece of the puzzle. It’s been stockpiling. The International Energy Agency said Chinese inventories increased by 82 million barrels during the second quarter, equal to almost 900,000 bpd. Refineries are running at high capacity. Power plants in the Middle East are burning more oil for electricity during the summer months, which means barrels are getting soaked up locally. That demand pressure helps explain why spot prices are higher than longer-term contracts, a market setup called backwardation. Richard Price, an analyst at Energy Aspects, said , “The market is still tight on the prompt.” Low inventories and weak exports add to the squeeze The oil market is still running on low fuel. Over the last three years, OECD countries haven’t recovered their stock levels. In May, Europe’s stocks were 394 million barrels, almost 9% below their five-year average. In June, U.S. commercial crude inventories stood at 419 million barrels, also under their five-year norm. OPEC+ officials say these low stockpiles prove that more oil is still needed, despite the group’s internal struggles. Summer demand also drains local barrels. Producers in the Gulf often export less during the hot season to meet higher air conditioning needs at home. This cuts into their ability to ship out what little extra oil they may be producing. Russia isn’t helping either. Attacks on its energy infrastructure have made it hard to lift production. Meanwhile, other members with limited capacity still want higher quotas during monthly OPEC+ meetings, not because they can use them now, but so they have room to expand later or trade off future cuts. The penalties aren’t going anywhere yet. Iraq, Russia, and others who overproduced earlier are still under output restrictions.

2025-08-07 14:08:08,49695245,1754575688,What to Expect for XRP Price in the Coming Days? CryptoQuant Analyst Explains!,"In the latest altcoin rally led by Ethereum (ETH), XRP reached a new ATH. While the new ATH fueled bullish sentiment, XRP fell below $3 during the general market decline. Evaluating the decline and selling pressure in XRP, CryptoQuant analyst said that he expects the structural weakness in XRP to continue as the selling pressure intensifies. CryptoQuant analyst The Enigma Trader predicted in a recent analysis that the market's structural weakness is likely to continue due to increasing selling pressure from Ripple (XRP) whales. The XRP whale wallet flow indicator has reportedly turned 'sharply negative,' the analyst said. The analyst noted that outflows from large wallets were observed, similar to patterns seen before past price corrections, and that this situation increased the risk of a possible correction. “The 90-day moving average whale flow in XRP has shifted into negative territory, indicating new outflows from large wallet addresses. A similar pattern was observed between January and February. The formation of a short-term top in XRP led to sustained selling by whales and subsequent price pullbacks. Finally, the analyst said that unless the whale's average daily net inflow exceeds 5 million XRP, the market will show structural weakness and a positive reversal may be difficult. *This is not investment advice.

Thrilled to announce Pharos will integrate with @MorphoLabs , one of the most trusted lending networks By embedding Morpho’s lending framework into the Pharos Mainnet, we support intricate, institutional-grade strategies while maintaining the adaptability and openness synonymous… pic.twitter.com/iVnvfkm33V — Pharos | Testnet Live (@pharos_network) August 7, 2025 The collaboration aims to establish institutional-grade lending rails within the on-chain real-world asset ecosystem. Morpho’s deployment on Pharos will deliver capital-efficient lending with isolated risks to RWA vaults, creating flexible credit markets for asset originators and liquidity providers. The integration positions Morpho as the official lending infrastructure provider for Pharos and supports the broader RWAfi strategy alongside players like Ant Digital, R25, and Gauntlet. The collaboration offers both DeFi-native and institutional participants with transparent, modular tools for lending and credit risk modeling. A more transparent and capital-efficient on-chain credit ecosystem “For us, working together with Morpho is about building trust and composability at the core of RWAfi,” said Wish Wu, CTO and Co-Founder at Pharos. “By integrating Morpho’s lending infrastructure directly into our mainnet, we’re laying the foundation for a more transparent and capital-efficient on-chain credit ecosystem. It enables us to support complex, institution-grade lending strategies while preserving the modularity and openness that define DeFi.” “Deploying natively on Pharos allows us to keep extending Morpho’s most trusted lending infrastructure to the real-world asset space following initial success like private credit and tokenized stocks,” said Kirk Hutchison, New Chains Growth at Morpho. “Pharos’ vision for RWAfi aligns with our commitment to transparent and scalable credit systems. Together, we are creating a powerful infrastructure for structured lending products, better risk pricing, and more accessible yield opportunities across both institutional and retail markets.” Morpho’s protocol will support Pharos’ upcoming vault launches and capital deployment frameworks. Initial deployments will focus on institutional vault designs, enhanced by Pharos’ capabilities in credit modeling, liquidity routing, and custody. The native integration was designed to enable composability with Pharos’ existing infrastructure and support experimentation around RWA yield structures and capital matching algorithms.

2025-08-07 14:05:43,49695429,1754575543,HashFlare Co-Founders Seek Leniency Ahead of Sentencing in $577M Crypto Fraud Case,"The co-founders of now-defunct crypto mining service HashFlare are asking a U.S. federal judge for leniency ahead of their sentencing for wire fraud, while prosecutors are pushing for a decade behind bars. Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, argue that they have already served significant time in Estonian custody and have cooperated with U.S. authorities. In a sentencing memo filed Wednesday in Seattle federal court, prosecutors called for 10-year prison terms for each of the men, labeling the case as the most extensive crypto fraud ever tried in that jurisdiction. Prosecutors said the scheme cost victims an estimated $300 million and involved selling $577 million worth of fraudulent mining contracts between 2015 and 2019 . Defense Claims Losses Are Overstated In their own memo, Potapenko and Turõgin disputed the extent of financial harm caused, noting that many HashFlare customers actually profited due to rising cryptocurrency prices. They argue that of the $487 million customers spent on mining contracts, roughly $2.3 billion was later withdrawn, resulting in limited long-term financial damage for many. Their attorneys also emphasized that the pair spent 16 months behind bars in Estonia before being extradited to the U.S. in May 2024. They are currently out on bail and awaiting sentencing, scheduled for August 14. The defense team further noted that over $400 million in assets have been forfeited as part of their February plea deal, and these funds are expected to be used to repay all victims in full. Strong Deterrence in HashFlare Ponzi Scheme? Despite the defendants’ claims, prosecutors maintained that HashFlare was a textbook Ponzi scheme. They said Potapenko and Turõgin faked mining capacity, posted fabricated returns, and paid earlier investors with money from new ones — all while funding lavish personal lifestyles. The memo urged Judge Robert Lasnik to impose a sentence that reflects “the seriousness of the offense” and deters future crypto-related fraud. Prosecutors also dismissed arguments that the case should have been tried in Estonia, pointing out that over 50,000 of HashFlare’s 440,000 customers were based in the U.S. and had collectively invested more than $130 million. Meanwhile, Potapenko and Turõgin continue to seek deportation to Estonia. Though a U.S. court ordered them to remain in the country, they received a letter in April from the Department of Homeland Security suggesting they should “deport immediately,” raising questions about how international crypto crime cases will be handled moving forward.

2025-08-07 14:05:25,49695165,1754575525,Top Analyst Says XRP Is About to Explode. Here’s Why,"The XRP market has shown some volatility in recent weeks, but a new chart shared by crypto analyst JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) suggests that the token may be on the verge of a major breakout. While most traders have been watching short-term moves, a broader technical formation appears to be developing on the weekly chart. The chart shows XRP consolidating within a rising wedge pattern . Price action has steadily moved between two converging trendlines since the start of 2025, with higher lows supporting a gradual upward trend. At the time of JackTheRippler’s analysis, XRP was trading at approximately $2.95, hovering near the upper third of the channel. JackTheRippler suggests that XRP is about to explode due to this setup, and his post has since gained widespread attention among XRP holders, many of whom view the pattern as a strong continuation signal. #XRP IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE! pic.twitter.com/AK7BfZYHLH — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 6, 2025 XRP Price Consolidation Signals Strength Looking closely at the price structure, XRP experienced a sharp rise earlier in the year before entering a tightening range. The chart indicates a healthy consolidation phase , with sellers unable to push the price below the ascending support line. Volume data also shows a surge in trading activity during major upward movements, which is consistent with accumulation behavior during a bullish trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Breakout Level Nears as Market Watches $3 The key resistance currently sits just above the $3 mark, aligning with the top boundary of the wedge. A decisive breakout above this level could open the path toward higher targets, with the $4.5 to $5 zone potentially in play if momentum continues. While wedge patterns can occasionally break downward, the prevailing structure and rising volume suggest buyers are in control for now . Macro Factors Support Bullish Outlook Although past price action is not a guarantee of future performance, the technical picture suggests that XRP could be preparing for its next major move. If the current structure holds and breaks to the upside, it would likely confirm growing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. With a few days remaining on the current weekly candle, market participants are closely watching how XRP behaves around the $3 level. If the asset can surpass this crucial level and turn it into support, it could be a pivotal moment for the digital asset and kickstart the run toward new all-time highs.

2025-08-07 14:05:11,49695197,1754575511,U.S. Stock Markets Soar: A Powerful Boost for Financial Markets,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Markets Soar: A Powerful Boost for Financial Markets The highly anticipated opening of U.S. stock markets today delivered a wave of positive news, with all major indices registering significant gains. This strong start suggests a buoyant mood among investors, signaling a potential continuation of the current market rally . For those closely watching global financial markets , this uplift provides crucial insights into broader economic confidence and shifting investor sentiment . We delve into what’s propelling this upward trend and its potential ripple effects across various asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. What’s Fueling This U.S. Stock Markets Surge? Today’s robust performance across U.S. stock markets is a clear indicator of growing optimism. The S&P 500 climbed by an impressive +0.53%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ led the charge with a +0.77% gain. Furthermore, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also posted a healthy +0.61% increase. These figures paint a picture of widespread positive momentum across key sectors. S&P 500: +0.53% NASDAQ: +0.77% Dow Jones: +0.61% Several factors typically contribute to such an encouraging open. Often, positive corporate earnings reports, favorable macroeconomic data, or even shifts in monetary policy expectations can significantly bolster investor sentiment . Today’s strong opening suggests that recent developments are being interpreted positively by market participants, driving this initial surge. How Does This Market Rally Influence Investor Sentiment? A sustained market rally often has a profound impact on overall investor sentiment . When major indices consistently rise, it instills confidence, encouraging more capital to flow into equities. This positive feedback loop can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where good news begets more good news, and upward trends become more entrenched. This heightened confidence can also spill over into other areas of the financial markets . Moreover, a strong stock market can sometimes indicate a higher risk appetite among investors. They might become more willing to explore alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies, if they feel secure in their traditional portfolios. This is where the interplay between traditional assets and digital assets becomes particularly interesting. Therefore, keeping an eye on key economic indicators is vital; they often provide early signals of these broader market shifts. The Broader Picture: What Do Financial Markets Tell Us? The performance of U.S. stock markets is not an isolated event; it sends signals across global financial markets . A strong performance here can lead to a general improvement in risk-on assets worldwide. While cryptocurrencies sometimes decouple from traditional markets, there are instances where a positive stock market environment fosters a more speculative and growth-oriented mindset among investors, potentially benefiting digital assets. Understanding these broader trends is crucial for any investor. For instance, if robust economic indicators continue to emerge, it could signal sustained growth, which might indirectly support the crypto space by increasing disposable income or institutional interest. However, it’s also important to remember that crypto markets have their unique drivers and inherent volatility. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Key Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on inflation data, employment figures, and GDP reports. These can influence both stock and crypto markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: While stocks are performing well, a balanced approach across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Market conditions can change rapidly. Regular updates on both traditional and digital asset news are vital for informed decision-making. A Powerful Outlook for Financial Markets Today’s impressive opening for U.S. stock markets undeniably injects a powerful dose of optimism into the broader financial markets . The positive performance across the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow reflects a strong investor sentiment , likely driven by encouraging economic indicators and corporate performance. While the direct correlation with cryptocurrencies varies, a generally positive economic climate can foster a more adventurous investment landscape. As this market rally continues, staying informed and adaptable will be key to navigating the evolving investment landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused U.S. stock markets to open higher today? A1: Today’s higher open was likely driven by a combination of positive factors such as strong corporate earnings reports, favorable macroeconomic data, or shifts in monetary policy expectations, all contributing to improved investor sentiment. Q2: How do U.S. stock market gains affect investor confidence? A2: Significant gains in U.S. stock markets generally boost investor confidence, leading to a higher risk appetite. This can encourage more investment in equities and potentially other asset classes across financial markets. Q3: Is there a direct link between this stock market rally and crypto prices? A3: While cryptocurrencies have their own unique drivers, a positive stock market environment, signaling strong economic indicators, can sometimes foster a more speculative mindset among investors, potentially leading to increased interest in digital assets.

2025-08-07 14:02:17,49694996,1754575337,Ethereum Price Prediction: $419M in Sell Pressure Hits ETH – Is The Bull Market Over?,"The Ethereum price has surged to $3,819 in the past 24 hours, outpacing Bitcoin with a sharp 5% surge that signals renewed strength in the altcoin market. Despite a minor dip over the past week, ETH is now 49% higher than it was a month ago, as institutional and corporate buyers continue to pile in. Today’s rally has absorbed more than $400 million in sell pressure from the previous day, and ETH is now eyeing a breakout above key resistance. If that level gives way, the stage could be set for new all-time highs, with the long-term Ethereum price prediction looking more bullish than ever. Ethereum Price Prediction: $419M in Sell Pressure Hits ETH – Is The Bull Market Over? Alarm bells sounded yesterday when analyst J.A. Maartunn posted a tweet warning of a “dump alert,” based on data which showed the net taker volume for Ethereum futures was negative. ETH Dump Alert: -$418.8M Net Taker Volume (daily) Taker sellers offloaded 115.4K more $ETH than buyers were willing to absorb. This is the 2nd largest daily sell-side imbalance ever. pic.twitter.com/XDw9cmDbKS — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 6, 2025 In fact, the net taker volume was -$418 million, which is the “2nd largest daily sell-side imbalance ever,” according to Maartunn. In theory, what the net taker metric indicates is the balance between buy and sell volumes, with a negative reading – as above – signalling a preponderance of selling. Such a preponderance should indicate bearish sentiment, yet what’s interesting here is that Ethereum’s net taker volume has been hugely negative for pretty much the entire year. This includes during the bull run that followed Donald Trump’s victory in November’s election, and during its run of the past couple of weeks. This is perhaps counterintuitive, so it may be tempting to ignore the metric, or to jump to the conclusion that there’s something unstable or unpredictable about the current bull market. Other metrics indicate that we’re currently in a very bullish period for Ethereum, with its chart today showing renewed momentum, after a lull several days ago. Source: TradingView For instance, its RSI (yellow) is shooting back towards 70 after dropping below 30 at the start of this month. Something similar applies to its MACD (orange, blue), while we also see that its price has just broken out of a descending channel. As such, it’s now close to a big breakout, one which could propel it back above $4,000 and then towards $5,000, despite the negative taker volumes. Layer-Two Network Bitcoin Hyper Raises $7.4 Million in Presale: Could It 100x After Listing? Ethereum continues to be one of the strongest coins in the market, yet the coming months are also likely to see other, newer tokens outperforming averages. This includes several promising presale coins, with possibly the most interesting on a fundamental level being Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an L2 project . Bitcoin Hyper is now running Solana programs natively on its Bitcoin-anchored rollup. Developers can use standard Solana CLI tools. Deploy, call, logs, config get—powered by a custom SVM runtime. No simulation. No bridges. No trusted parties. All state changes are real,… pic.twitter.com/tcUqVWtwXU — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 5, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has raised a hugely impressive $7.4 million in its ongoing presale, making it one of the biggest ICOs of 2025. This is a testament to the confidence the new project is inspiring, which stems from its plans to launch a layer-two network for Bitcoin (BTC). By using zero-knowledge proofs and Solana’s Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 will offer superior speed, scalability, security and privacy. It promises to tap into Bitcoin’s enormous value for DeFi and trading purposes, with BTC holders able to deposit their funds and receive an equivalent amount of HYPER to spend within the L2’s ecosystem. HYPER will have a max supply of 21 billion tokens, with holders also able to stake the coin, earning themselves a regular income on top of any price increases. Given its functionality, and given that Bitcoin lacks a smart contract-oriented L2, Bitcoin Hyper could be one of the biggest success stories of 2025. Investors can join its presale at the Bitcoin Hyper website , where HYPER currently costs $0.01255. This will continue to rise for the duration of the sale, so newcomers should act quickly.

2025-08-07 14:02:04,49696109,1754575324,Binance launches $1.2 million flood relief in Taiwan as legal battle with FTX unfolds,"Binance Charity has launched a relief initiative worth up to $1,200,000 in BNB to support users affected by extreme flooding in southern Taiwan. The crypto exchange will provide direct assistance to Binance account holders living in the hardest-hit areas, including Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. Distribution begins on August 14. Two waves of support will roll out based on users’ proof-of-address (POA) status, with the aim of assisting up to 30,000 eligible residents. The move comes as Binance and its co-founder, Changpeng Zhao, face mounting legal challenges, including a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX bankruptcy trust. First round of $80 in BNB for users verified before August 7 Binance stated that account holders with verified addresses in the disaster zones, submitted prior to August 7, will receive $80 in BNB directly into their Binance wallets. This initial tranche is targeted at users already residing in the flood-affected districts before the latest round of heavy rainfall. The floods, triggered by torrential monsoon rains, have caused widespread disruption across Taiwan’s southern municipalities. Binance’s approach leverages on-chain data and user verification tools to streamline aid delivery. Eligible users do not need to take further action apart from having previously submitted POA documentation by the specified cut-off. Second round adds $30 in BNB for 15,000 newly verified users A second round of support will follow for the first 15,000 Binance users who complete POA verification between August 7 and August 20. Each of these users will receive $30 in BNB. Funds will begin to be disbursed alongside the first wave from August 14. The donation initiative is part of Binance Charity’s ongoing disaster relief operations. In the past, the organisation has supported recovery efforts following the Hualien earthquake in Taiwan, and extended help to disaster-hit regions in Turkey, Argentina, Thailand, Myanmar, and across Europe. In 2023, Binance airdropped $100 in BNB to Turkish users affected by the earthquake. Other crypto companies also pledged TRY 5 million ($265,550) in support at the time. In April 2025, Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, donated 1,000 BNB (worth around $598,025) to assist earthquake victims in Myanmar and Thailand. CZ faces $1.76B FTX lawsuit amid charity efforts While Binance accelerates flood relief in Taiwan, Zhao remains locked in a legal dispute with the FTX bankruptcy estate. Earlier this week, Zhao filed a motion to dismiss the $1.76 billion clawback suit brought against him by FTX. Filed in late 2024, the lawsuit alleges that Binance received $1.76 billion through a 2021 share purchase agreement from a then-insolvent FTX. The claim states the transfer was fraudulent and seeks to recover the funds. Zhao’s legal team argued that the Delaware court lacks jurisdiction, as he is a UAE resident and the deal has limited ties to US law. They also maintained that the allegations fail to meet the requirements for constructive fraud under federal securities regulations. Binance has continued to reject FTX’s claims as meritless, framing them as an effort to deflect responsibility from former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

2025-08-07 14:00:52,49694982,1754575252,US SEC Becoming Pro-Crypto? The Quiet Stablecoin Amendment The Market Isn’t Talking About,"The US SEC has released new guidance for stablecoins, in a move that could further boost the adoption of these dollar-pegged coins. This follows the launch of Project Crypto , which the Commission has highlighted as a roadmap to make the US the crypto capital. US SEC Releases New Guidance For Stablecoins According to a Bloomberg report , the US SEC has released new staff guidance that certain stablecoins could be treated as cash. Under this guidance, holders of dollar-backed stablecoins , which are backed with another asset class, could classify these coins as cash equivalents if they have a guaranteed redemption right. This will typically refer to stablecoins that are backed by the dollar or other liquid reserve assets such as short-term treasury bills, as provided by the GENIUS Act . This US SEC guidance indicates that companies that hold compliant stablecoins might not need to report them as digital assets but can simply classify them as cash equivalents. This guidance could promote further adoption of stablecoins, especially among public companies, since the US SEC is suggesting that it views these coins as cash equivalents. Meanwhile, it comes just a week after the Commission launched Project Crypto in a bid to position the US as the global crypto leader by providing regulatory clarity for the industry. It is also worth noting that the US SEC had earlier confirmed that stablecoins were not securities. Back then, it explained that the non-security stablecoins are ones that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar on a one-for-one basis. Furthermore, they can be redeemed for a dollar on this one-for-one basis and are backed by assets held in reserve that are considered low risk and liquid enough in dollar value. Meanwhile, US SEC Chair Paul Atkins was full of praise for stablecoins following the passage of the GENIUS Act. He described them as being very important for the market, as they can help lower costs and mitigate market risk. SEC’s Moves Since The Launch Of Project Crypto Besides the new guidance on stablecoins, the US SEC has also made further moves since the launch of Project Crypto. This includes the announcement of new crypto roundtables , which the Commission’s Crypto Task Force intends to carry out around the US. According to the schedule, the roundtables will span from August 4 to December 5 and cut across ten cities. US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the Crypto Task Force , explained that they want to use this as an avenue to hear from crypto stakeholders who couldn’t make it for the earlier roundtables that took place in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, more recently, the US SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance announced that liquid staking activities and tokens are not securities. This guidance means that the Commission could approve the inclusion of liquid staking tokens in crypto ETFs, starting with the Solana ETFs.",Crypto News|Bloomberg|crypto|Crypto Task Force|Division of Corporation Finance|Donald Trump|GENIUS Act|Hester Peirce|Paul Atkins|Stablecoins|US SEC,EN,1,u sec released new guidance stablecoins move could boost adoption coin follows launch project crypto commission highlighted roadmap make u crypto capital u sec release new guidance stablecoins according bloomberg report u sec released new staff guidance certain stablecoins could treated cash guidance holder stablecoins backed another asset class could classify coin cash equivalent guaranteed redemption right typically refer stablecoins backed dollar liquid reserve asset treasury bill provided genius act u sec guidance indicates company hold compliant stablecoins might need report digital asset simply classify cash equivalent guidance could promote adoption stablecoins especially among public company since u sec suggesting view coin cash equivalent meanwhile come week commission launched project crypto bid position u global crypto leader providing regulatory clarity industry also worth noting u sec earlier confirmed stablecoins security back explained stablecoins one designed maintain stable value relative u dollar basis furthermore redeemed dollar basis backed asset held reserve considered low risk liquid enough dollar value meanwhile u sec chair paul atkins full praise stablecoins following passage genius act described important market help lower cost mitigate market risk sec move since launch project crypto besides new guidance stablecoins u sec also made move since launch project crypto includes announcement new crypto roundtable commission crypto task force intends carry around u according schedule roundtable span august december cut across ten city u sec commissioner hester peirce lead crypto task force explained want use avenue hear crypto stakeholder make earlier roundtable took place washington meanwhile recently u sec division corporation finance announced liquid staking activity token security guidance mean commission could approve inclusion liquid staking token crypto etf starting solana etf,0.037,0.784,0.18,0.9855,1
2025-08-07 14:00:44,49694963,1754575244,PokerStars and 888 Casino Just Got Outpaced: Spartans Takes the Lead With 43 Providers and Transparent Bonuses,"The online betting world is shifting, and fast. While PokerStars returns with its prestigious WCOOP series and 888 Casino prepares for a long-awaited relaunch in the Netherlands, another platform has quietly surged ahead by focusing on performance, not just brand power. That platform is Spartans. In an industry full of splashy campaigns and region-gated perks, Spartans is winning where it counts: instant crypto withdrawals, a tactical sportsbook, 43 top-tier game providers, and 5,963 live games, all backed by a 300% welcome bonus with clear, no-nonsense terms. While PokerStars and 888 chase momentum through events and partnerships, Spartans is already delivering what players want most, access, speed, and clarity. With no app needed, no hidden conditions, and a Lamborghini giveaway in motion, the message is clear: 2025’s top betting site isn’t one of the usual suspects. It’s Spartans, and it’s live. PokerStars Returns With Prestige, Not Payout Speed PokerStars’ WCOOP 2025 announcement is exciting news for online poker loyalists. The Boot Camp warm-up series is back, along with the BBZ Poker training partnership, Ticket Machine rewards, and tens of millions in guaranteed prize money. From September 7 to October 1, the platform will dominate the poker spotlight with the longest-running online tournament series in the world. But while WCOOP reaffirms PokerStars’ place in competitive poker, it doesn’t address broader player demands around real-time payouts, crypto compatibility, or betting diversity. The platform remains largely poker-centric, with a structure geared toward event-based engagement rather than daily, on-demand gaming. Withdrawals are fiat-based and often subject to delays depending on location and volume. Bonus terms vary across jurisdictions, and there’s no meaningful presence in the sportsbook or casino spaces outside traditional offerings. For tournament veterans, PokerStars is still elite. But for crypto-first users and casino players seeking speed, variety, and on-demand access, its ecosystem isn’t built for what modern bettors expect. 888 Casino’s Comeback Lacks Crypto Readiness After four years away, 888 Casino is reentering the Dutch market via a partnership with ComeOn Group. Under a local license, 888.nl will bring back casino and sports betting for Dutch players, though poker is notably absent from this relaunch. The move aligns with Evoke plc’s strategy to expand into regulated markets through low-capital, high-impact partnerships. The brand name carries weight, but the return is limited in scope. There’s been no mention of crypto integration, instant payouts, or any technical advancements that match what newer platforms are offering. Given that major operators like PokerStars and Entain also exited the Dutch market in 2021, the re-entry is more about compliance than invention. 888 has history and reach, but not yet the infrastructure for a crypto-driven, speed-focused player base. And with no announced launch date, Dutch users are still waiting for access, while faster, more agile competitors like Spartans are already live and optimized for instant action. Spartans Leads the Pack With Real Payouts, Real Odds, and Zero Friction In a year full of relaunches and rebrands, Spartans isn’t playing catch-up, it’s defining the standard. Built for bettors who value speed and clarity, the platform offers a seamless user experience that’s actually built around real activity, not delayed promises. At the core is a 300% welcome bonus that’s as bold as it is transparent: 35x wagering, 7-day validity, and no geographic restrictions. Whether you’re in Europe, Asia, or the Americas, the terms are the same and fully visible before deposit. There’s no app requirement, no geo-blocked content, and no fine print to parse. Crypto withdrawals are where Spartans truly outpaces its rivals. Payouts via BTC, ETH, and USDT are processed instantly, and they’re consistent; no hidden limits, no holding periods. Win, withdraw, done. Backed by 5,963 live games from 43 verified providers, the platform’s depth is matched only by its sportsbook. With combo bets, live stats, and coverage of top leagues from EPL to UFC, it’s designed for users who want to bet tactically and cash out quickly. To top it off, Spartans is running a Lamborghini giveaway tied directly to user activity. It’s not a raffle for signing up, it rewards actual play, giving value back to engaged users. Where legacy platforms chase scale and brand awareness, Spartans focuses on delivering value now. It’s not just an alternative; it’s a step ahead. The Betting Site to Watch in 2025! As 888 Casino rebuilds and PokerStars sharpens its tournament edge, Spartans is making its move, quietly becoming the top online betting site for players who care about speed, access, and fairness. The platform combines fast crypto payouts, a deep game catalog, and a sportsbook with real utility, all wrapped in bonus terms users can actually understand. There’s no waiting period, no app barrier, and no second-guessing the rules. In a space dominated by legacy names and delayed updates, Spartans is already doing what others are still planning. Whether you’re in it for casino play, strategic bets, or real rewards, this is where the action is happening. The rankings have shifted, and Spartans is out front.

2025-08-07 04:00:26,49672274,1754539226,"Top Crypto to Buy Now: BlockDAG Extends Lead Over Ethereum, Solana & Toncoin","The market is full of opportunities, but picking the right ones is what makes all the difference. This month, a mix of presale gems and established names is catching the attention of traders and long-term holders alike. BlockDAG is offering one of the lowest entry points we’ve seen in a presale with high ROI potential, while Ethereum keeps drawing institutional money, Solana has become a key player in staking and futures markets, and Toncoin is building on deep ecosystem partnerships. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, this list gives you a clear breakdown of what’s trending now, why these coins are worth watching, and how they’re positioned for the months ahead. 1. BlockDAG: A Presale with Real Tools and Big Incentives BlockDAG is offering one of the most exciting presale setups we’ve seen in 2025. With approximately $363 million already raised and around 24.6 billion tokens sold, it’s clear that demand is strong. The temporary $0.0016 tier running until August 11 is a big draw, especially when compared to the current batch price of $0.0276 and the planned $0.05 listing price. This gives early buyers a chance at an impressive 3,000% potential ROI. On top of this, BlockDAG has launched a 10 BTC auction prize pool worth about $1.1 million, where rewards are distributed proportionally to the amount purchased. This combination of low entry pricing and direct incentives is designed to push engagement in the final days of the presale. The project also goes beyond traditional token sales. Its Dashboard V4 simulates a live trading environment with real-time BDAG/USD charts, functional order books, wallet updates, and instant buy/sell features. This gamified setup allows participants to test strategies and get comfortable with the interface before launch. Combined with a growing community of over 2 million users mining through its X1 Mobile Miner, BlockDAG is setting up a full-fledged ecosystem even before listing. If you’re deciding on the best crypto to buy, BlockDAG’s mix of value pricing, training tools, and community incentives make it a standout choice. 2. Ethereum: Strong Institutional Backing Ethereum remains one of the best crypto to buy as its position in the market continues to strengthen. Currently trading between $3,600 and $3,700, ETH has been on an upswing, gaining around 54% over the past month and outperforming Bitcoin’s 10% rise. Even with a significant $465 million ETF outflow from BlackRock’s ETHA on August 4, corporate treasuries now hold close to 966,000 ETH, worth about $3.5 billion, up from just 116,000 ETH at the end of 2024. This shows confidence from institutions, many of which are also attracted to Ethereum’s staking yields of around 3–4%. Regulatory developments are another tailwind. With the GENIUS Act and stablecoin legislation in motion, Ethereum is becoming a preferred choice for corporates and institutions looking for a reliable asset. Analysts believe it has the potential to test resistance levels around $4,100 and possibly move toward its all-time high of $4,865. With a robust network, consistent upgrades, and deep institutional adoption, Ethereum is cementing its place as a cornerstone crypto investment for 2025. 3. Solana: Institutional Demand and Key Price Levels Solana is proving why it deserves attention, especially if you’re considering the best crypto to buy in 2025. Trading between $165 and $170, SOL has seen a sharp rise in institutional activity. CME futures open interest for Solana has climbed to $800 million, a massive 370% increase month-over-month, and the first U.S. Solana staking ETF has already launched. Adding to this momentum, Bit Mining recently invested $5 million in SOL and unveiled plans to raise $300 million for Solana treasury and infrastructure projects. On-chain data shows whales are accumulating, with $52 million in recent withdrawals from exchanges, and nearly 43% of holders are sitting at unrealized losses, signaling possible strong hands taking advantage of current price levels. Technically, Solana is at a key support range between $165 and $170. A sustained breakout above $171 could set it up for a rally toward $200 or even higher long-term targets of $900 if bullish momentum builds. These factors make Solana a coin to watch closely in the coming weeks. 4. Toncoin: Building Big Partnerships Toncoin is holding steady around $3.6–3.7 and has grown 24% over the past month. It’s quickly becoming a project to watch, especially after the TON Foundation secured a $400 million institutional treasury partnership. DeFi platform STON.fi also raised $9.5 million to enhance cross-chain functionality, boosting Toncoin’s utility. One of the most talked-about developments is Nasdaq-listed Verb Technology raising $558 million to launch the first public Toncoin treasury, with the deal closing by August 7. This growth is closely tied to Toncoin’s deep integration with Telegram, which rolled out TON Wallet access to its 87 million U.S. users. While some analysts predict a possible pullback to $2.62 in the short term, others see this as a chance for strategic entry before the ecosystem expands further. Combined with its growing visibility and institutional adoption, Toncoin offers both short-term volatility and long-term upside, making it one of the more interesting picks in today’s market. Summing Up If you’re evaluating the best crypto to buy , these four are hard to ignore. BlockDAG stands out with its $0.0016 presale tier, interactive trading dashboard, and 10 BTC auction, creating strong FOMO for those who don’t want to miss out before August 11. Ethereum continues to attract big money and regulatory support, strengthening its market position. Solana is showing powerful institutional demand and promising price action at critical levels. Toncoin’s ecosystem growth and deep Telegram integration make it a compelling choice for those willing to ride out its volatility. Together, these projects show the variety of opportunities the current market offers, whether you want a high-ROI presale, a trusted long-term asset, or a project with bold ecosystem plans.

2025-08-07 04:00:09,49672234,1754539209,"Ethereum, Not Bitcoin, May Be The Future’s Preferred Store Of Value – VanEck Report","In its July 2025 crypto monthly recap report, global investment management firm VanEck suggested that Ethereum (ETH) could emerge as a superior store of value compared to Bitcoin (BTC). The report pointed to ETH’s lower inflation rate in recent months relative to BTC, alongside its growing utility within decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum A Better Store Of Value Than Bitcoin? In recent years, a growing number of companies have diversified their treasuries by allocating capital to digital assets – most notably Bitcoin. However, emerging trends show that corporations are also beginning to accumulate Ethereum, recognizing its potential as both a yield-generating and deflationary asset. VanEck’s report emphasizes that while Bitcoin’s finite supply and predictable issuance policies make it a strong candidate for a store of value, Ethereum provides greater financial flexibility. In particular, ETH holders can stake their assets to earn rewards, collect network revenue, and participate in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield. The report also highlights key differences in the monetary policies of both networks. Ethereum’s initial issuance rate at launch was 14.4%, compared to Bitcoin’s 9.3%. However, two major policy changes have since dramatically reduced ETH’s inflation rate – bringing it below Bitcoin’s. The first was Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), implemented in August 2021, which introduced a mechanism to “burn” a portion of transaction fees. This effectively created deflationary pressure during periods of high network activity, reducing the total supply of ETH. The second transformative event was “The Merge” in September 2022, when Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This change drastically reduced issuance – from approximately 13,000 ETH/day to around 1,700 ETH/day – by eliminating the need to pay miners. Following these changes, ETH’s inflation rate fell below Bitcoin’s for the first time in March 2023. Since then, ETH’s supply has grown by only 0.2%, compared to Bitcoin’s 3%. The report states: Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%). Companies Flocking To ETH Accumulation Over the past month, several companies have unveiled Ethereum-focused treasury strategies. For instance, cryptocurrency firm Bit Digital recently crossed 120,000 ETH in total holdings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies revealed that its ETH holdings had surged past 833,000 tokens, making it the largest known corporate holder of the digital asset. At press time, ETH trades at $3,643, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|btc|Cryptocurrency|EIP-1559|ETH|Ether|Ethereum inflation|ethereum issuance rate|ETHUSDT|Store of value,EN,1,july crypto monthly recap report global investment management firm vaneck suggested ethereum eth could emerge superior store value compared bitcoin btc report pointed eth lower inflation rate recent month relative btc alongside growing utility within decentralized finance defi ethereum better store value bitcoin recent year growing number company diversified treasury allocating capital digital asset notably bitcoin however emerging trend show corporation also beginning accumulate ethereum recognizing potential deflationary asset vaneck report emphasizes bitcoin finite supply predictable issuance policy make strong candidate store value ethereum provides greater financial flexibility particular eth holder stake asset earn reward collect network revenue participate defi protocol generate additional yield report also highlight key difference monetary policy network ethereum initial issuance rate launch compared bitcoin however two major policy change since dramatically reduced eth inflation rate bringing bitcoin first ethereum improvement proposal implemented august introduced mechanism burn portion transaction fee effectively created deflationary pressure period high network activity reducing total supply eth second transformative event merge september ethereum transitioned pow po consensus mechanism change drastically reduced issuance approximately around eliminating need pay miner following change eth inflation rate fell bitcoin first time march since eth supply grown compared bitcoin report state total supply eth fell october april moving low achieving annualized inflation rate period since time eth burn reduced due increase ethereum transaction throughput network accrued additional supply regardless period btc supply increased company flocking eth accumulation past month several company unveiled treasury strategy instance cryptocurrency firm bit digital recently crossed eth total holding meanwhile bitcoin mining firm bitmine immersion technology revealed eth holding surged past token making largest known corporate holder digital asset press time eth trade past hour,0.037,0.778,0.186,0.9906,1
2025-08-07 04:00:07,49672272,1754539207,"Cold Wallet, Solana, SUI, and Hedera Lead the List of Top Performing Cryptos This Month","The crypto space changes quickly, with new names showing up almost every day. But not all of them have value. What matters more are the projects with real use and strong potential for gains. For people new to crypto, knowing which ones to trust can be difficult. This list highlights four top performing crypto projects in July that showed clear signs of momentum: Cold Wallet, Solana, SUI, and Hedera. Each has a different purpose, but all of them are gaining interest as the market looks ahead. 1. Cold Wallet: Gaining Speed with Strong Funding and Features Cold Wallet is taking a different path from most wallets, which is helping it become a top performing crypto. While most wallets only store assets, Cold Wallet pays users for staying active. It offers cashback in CWT for every swap, bridge, or ramp. There is also a referral system and reward tiers that increase these earnings. The early response to the presale shows interest is growing. Cold Wallet has already raised over $5.7 million in a few weeks. Whale wallets are starting to get involved. Right now, Stage 16 prices CWT at $0.00942, and the listing is confirmed at $0.3517. This gives early users a possible return of 4,900%. What also drives this growth is the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, which added a large user base right away. This move shows Cold Wallet is planning for long-term scale. With working features, strong backing, and a major merger already done, Cold Wallet is setting itself apart as a smart option in this cycle. 2. Solana’s Continued Growth Shows Long-Term Promise Solana continues to be one of the top performing crypto assets, with its price now at $169.45. After recovering from earlier issues, the network has become one of the busiest in the space. Thanks to its fast speeds and low fees, it supports a wide range of use cases from NFTs to DeFi. User activity stays strong every day, and developers are still building actively on the network. It is even challenging Ethereum in daily usage, but without the higher costs. Projects like Stepn, Helium, and Jupiter Exchange are growing on Solana, adding to its ecosystem. With consistent growth and strong use in the real world, Solana’s pace is hard to overlook. 3. SUI Gains Attention with Developer-Friendly Features SUI is trading at $0.77 and is showing steady momentum as a newer Layer 1 network that focuses on user experience and speed. Supported by Mysten Labs and built using the Move language, SUI gives developers more flexibility when creating dApps. This flexibility helps SUI stand out in areas such as gaming, lending, and DeFi applications. Its total value locked continues to rise, and new launches are bringing in activity. Even though it is newer compared to platforms like Solana or Ethereum, its early position could be its biggest strength. Current trends suggest SUI is one of the top performing crypto assets to keep an eye on. 4. Hedera Builds Enterprise Use Through Real Adoption Hedera (HBAR), priced at $0.078, also makes the list of top performing crypto assets this week. Its edge comes from actual usage in real-world business settings. Built on Hashgraph, not traditional blockchain, Hedera delivers speed, fixed transaction costs, and low energy usage. This makes it ideal for large companies building at scale. Industries such as healthcare, identity systems, and supply chains are already using Hedera. Well-known companies like IBM, Google, and Dell are part of its Governing Council, showing strong support. Rather than being just another altcoin, Hedera is turning into important infrastructure for future use. Comparing These Projects for 2025 Potential Solana stays ahead with its fast network, low fees, and consistent builder activity. SUI is rising fast with its focus on developer tools, new product growth, and strong potential. At the same time, Hedera is becoming a key player in enterprise use with support from major companies and working systems in place. Still, for those looking at potential gains, Cold Wallet is making waves. Stage 16 has CWT priced at $0.00942, and its planned listing price is $0.3517, showing a 4,900% return for early buyers. This is not just guesswork. The $270 million buyout of Plus Wallet instantly brought in a large and active user base. For those exploring the next top performing crypto , Cold Wallet stands out with real progress, strong early backing, and a system built to scale. Getting in early could make a major difference in outcomes.

2025-08-07 03:45:18,49671755,1754538318,XRP ETF Speculation Fuels Rotation into DOGE and This New Altcoin,"XRP ETF speculation is shaking up the crypto market as capital rotates toward both established and emerging coins. With the SEC recently greenlighting the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP), attention has shifted to spot ETF approval odds, now pegged at 85% for September or October 2025. This development is sparking fresh DOGE capital rotation and highlighting new altcoin breakout stories. MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising name in the current altcoin rotation after XRP ETF news, is capturing interest from investors seeking high potential altcoin plays and outsized returns.

2025-08-07 03:18:44,49672787,1754536724,Bitcoin's Volatility Disappears to Levels Not Seen Since October 2023,"Bitcoin's (BTC) volatility meltdown continues as the cryptocurrency remains stagnant, with slow price action between $110,000 and $120,000. The cryptocurrency's 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV index, fell to an annualized 36.5% late on Wednesday, reaching levels last seen in October 2023, when BTC was trading below $30,000, according to data source TradingView. The new multi-year low in implied volatility suggests that options traders are not yet rushing for hedges, despite U.S. economic data raising concerns about stagflation. The demand for options, which are contracts used to hedge against or profit from price swings, is a major driver of an asset's implied volatility. The same thing can be said about stocks, where the VIX index has reversed Friday's spike from 17 to 21. The VIX measures the 30-day implied volatility in the S&P 500. BTC mirrors stock market volatility patterns BTC's implied volatility has been in a months-long downtrend, moving in the opposite direction of the cryptocurrency's price, which has surged from $70,000 to over $110,000 since November. The negative correlation marks a profound shift in bitcoin's market dynamics. Historically, BTC's volatility and its spot price moved in tandem, with volatility rising in both bull and bear markets. The change in this spot-volatility correlation is attributed, in part, to the growing popularity of structured products that involve the writing (selling) of out-of-the-money call options, analysts told CoinDesk . This new dynamic suggests that bitcoin is increasingly mirroring patterns on Wall Street, where implied volatility often dwindles during steady bull runs.

2025-08-07 03:18:28,49670763,1754536708,Ethereum Price Looks Strong – Uptrend May Resume Above Key Zone,"Ethereum price found support near the $3,540 zone and recovered. ETH is rising and might soon aim for a move above the $3,740 zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,540 and $3,580 levels. The price is trading above $3,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price started a fresh increase from the $3,540 support zone, beating Bitcoin . ETH price was able to recover above the $3,550 and $3,580 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $3,700 resistance zone . However, the bears remained active near the $3,750 zone. A high was formed at $3,733 and the price corrected some gains. There was a move below the $3,620 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,350 swing low to the $3,733 high. ETH is again rising above $3,600. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $3,700 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,720 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level. A clear move above the $3,750 resistance might send the price toward the $3,820 resistance. An upside break above the $3,820 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,000 resistance zone or even $4,120 in the near term. Are Dips Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,720 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,620 level. The first major support sits near the $3,580 zone. A clear move below the $3,580 support might push the price toward the $3,540 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,440 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

2025-08-07 03:10:10,49670489,1754536210,Decoding Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: What the Numbers Reveal,"BitcoinWorld Decoding Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: What the Numbers Reveal The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, constantly shifting with rapid price movements. For traders engaged in derivatives, understanding market mechanics is crucial. Today, we delve into a critical indicator: the crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the past 24 hours. This breakdown offers a fascinating glimpse into recent market volatility and prevailing market sentiment . What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? In the world of derivatives, a perpetual future is a type of futures contract that has no expiration date. This allows traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely. However, leverage comes with inherent risk. When a trader’s position falls below a certain margin requirement, it triggers a “liquidation.” Essentially, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This is a crucial aspect of the perpetual futures market . Our focus here is on short liquidations . A short position profits when the asset price goes down. Conversely, if the price unexpectedly rises sharply, these short positions face liquidation. High short liquidations often indicate a “short squeeze,” where a sudden price increase forces many short sellers to close their positions, further fueling the price rally. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Crypto Liquidations The past 24 hours have seen significant activity in the perpetual futures market , particularly concerning liquidations. Here’s a detailed look at the breakdown: ETH: $60.27 million in liquidations, with a dominant 62.65% being short positions. This suggests a notable upward price movement for Ethereum, catching many short sellers off guard. BTC: $22.29 million in liquidations, with an even higher 75.45% being short positions. Bitcoin experienced a strong surge that led to substantial losses for those betting on a price decline. MYX: $13.13 million in liquidations, with 66.58% being short positions. This altcoin also saw a significant number of short positions wiped out, reflecting similar market dynamics. These figures highlight a clear trend: a strong upward movement in these assets, leading to the forced closure of numerous short positions. The overwhelming percentage of short liquidations across all three assets points to a market that moved decisively against bearish bets, impacting overall market sentiment . Why Do Short Liquidations Dominate the Perpetual Futures Market? The dominance of short liquidations in this 24-hour period reveals a specific kind of market action. When a large number of traders are betting on prices to fall, a sudden positive catalyst or significant buying pressure can trigger a chain reaction. As prices rise, short positions quickly become unprofitable. Exchanges then step in, liquidating these positions to protect themselves and maintain market stability. This forced buying to close short positions further accelerates the price increase, creating a “short squeeze.” It’s a powerful phenomenon that can lead to rapid upward price spikes, as observed in the recent crypto liquidations data. Understanding this dynamic is key to interpreting current market sentiment . Actionable Insights from Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Data For traders, monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data is more than just observing numbers; it’s about gaining strategic insights. High short liquidations can signal a strong underlying buying pressure or a market turning point where bearish sentiment is being overwhelmed. Conversely, high long liquidations would suggest a market correction or a significant downturn. What can you do with this information? Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of robust risk management, especially when using leverage. Secondly, it provides a real-time pulse on current market sentiment . If short liquidations are consistently high, it might indicate a resilient market ready to push higher, or at least one that is punishing overly bearish bets. Always combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis for a comprehensive trading strategy. In conclusion, the past 24 hours provided a stark reminder of the volatility and potential for sharp movements within the crypto market. The substantial short liquidations across ETH, BTC, and MYX underscore a period where bullish momentum surprised many bearish traders. Monitoring these trends offers valuable insights into the market’s underlying strength and the risks associated with leveraged trading. Stay informed, stay strategic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A1: Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position in a perpetual futures contract falls below a certain margin requirement. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, protecting both the trader and the market. Q2: Why were short liquidations so high in the last 24 hours? A2: High short liquidations indicate that many traders betting on price declines (short positions) were caught off guard by a sudden upward price movement. This often leads to a “short squeeze,” where forced buying to cover positions further fuels the price increase. Q3: How does liquidation impact the crypto market? A3: Liquidations can amplify price movements. A wave of crypto liquidations can accelerate a rally (if shorts are liquidated) or a crash (if longs are liquidated), leading to increased volatility and rapid shifts in market sentiment . Q4: What does this data mean for an average trader? A4: For an average trader, this data underscores the inherent risks of leveraged trading and highlights the importance of risk management. It also provides insight into the prevailing market momentum; high short liquidations suggest bullish strength and a market punishing bearish bets. Q5: Is it possible to avoid liquidation? A5: While not always entirely avoidable in extreme market conditions, traders can significantly reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts. Proper risk management is key in the perpetual futures market . Did you find this breakdown helpful?

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a massive rally. Related Reading: Solana To Drop Before The ‘Real Move’? Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3 Cardano Retests Key Resistance Following last week’s drop to the $0.70 support, Cardano is attempting to break out of a crucial resistance level to continue its rally. The cryptocurrency has surged 8.8% from Friday’s low, retesting the $0.74-$0.76 area throughout this week. Notably, ADA has been hovering between the $0.65-$0.85 price range since the Q2 market recovery, briefly losing this area during the June pullback. However, the July market pump sent the altcoin to a four-month high of $0.93, sparking bullish sentiment among investors. Since then, Cardano has been in a downtrend, attempting to break out of the descending resistance for the past two weeks. Market watcher Sebastian noted that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly retested the $0.76 zone over the past few days, suggesting that “the more it tests it, the higher the likelihood to break it.” According to the analyst, ADA must reclaim the 50-day Moving Average (MA), which has served as a strong resistance and support level and coincides with the descending resistance breakout area. Following today’s performance, the altcoin has reclaimed the 50 MA indicator and eyes a retest of the $0.76 resistance. A breakout from this level would set the stage for a retest of the next crucial area between $0.79 and $0.80. “Getting back above $0.80 would confirm the trend reversal,” Sebastian affirmed. Meanwhile, a rejection from this area could propel Cardano to retest the recent lows and risk losing its local range again. ADA Breakout Eyes 85%-120% Rally Man of Bitcoin noted ADA’s recent performance, asserting that it is “now potentially working on a small 1-2 setup.” Based on this, he suggested that “as long as the price remains above the last swing low at $0.685, wave-5 of iii should follow next.” Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending channel since its December 2024 high of $1.32. According to the chart, ADA retested the channel’s upper boundary for the first time in months during the July breakout but was ultimately rejected. Reclaiming the $0.76 could propel the altcoin to the channel’s resistance, and “a breakout above $0.84 could set Cardano on a path toward $1.30.” Additionally, Martinez asserted that “ADA is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, only this time, it’s unfolding more gradually. And it feels like we’re right at the beginning of an explosive move.” Similarly, Crypto Bullet stated that Cardano has been following a pattern over this cycle. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading down for months before breaking out and reaching new local highs. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer Last month, the cryptocurrency broke out of its eight-month downtrend, targeting a rally toward the $1.60 area. Now, ADA is retesting the descending resistance line, which could set up the stage for the 120% jump if the breakout is confirmed. As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.74, a 3% increase in the daily timeframe.

2025-08-07 03:00:56,49671163,1754535656,Worldcoin in the Spotlight Again as China Warns of Biometric Data Threats,"China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has raised alarms over a foreign company’s (likely Worldcoin) collection of biometric data from users in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards, calling the practice a potential threat to both individual privacy and national security. The warning, published Wednesday on the agency’s official WeChat account, pointed to documented cases of large-scale iris data collection linked to crypto token distributions . While the MSS did not explicitly name the project, the description closely aligns with Worldcoin, a project developed by Tools for Humanity. Worldcoin has gained attention for using its “orb” devices to scan users’ irises to create unique digital IDs and distribute its cryptocurrency token, WLD. According to the MSS, the transfer of these sensitive data sources to external entities “poses risks not only to personal privacy but also to the country’s national security,” as biometric information can potentially be exploited beyond its stated purpose. Growing Global Scrutiny of Biometric Crypto Projects China’s warning adds to mounting global scrutiny over biometric data collection in the digital asset industry. Worldcoin, launched in 2023, has faced investigations and regulatory actions in multiple jurisdictions, primarily over concerns surrounding data protection and user consent. In May, Indonesian authorities suspended the project’s operating permit following reports of irregularities related to Worldcoin’s identity verification services. Tools for Humanity later stated that World voluntarily paused its proof-of-personhood operations in Indonesia while seeking clarity on licensing requirements . This is not the first time China has voiced concerns about crypto-linked risks. The country has long maintained strict policies on digital asset trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), emphasizing consumer protection and financial stability. Last month, Shenzhen’s financial regulator issued an alert warning citizens about fraudulent schemes disguised as stablecoin investments. The MSS statement expands the scope of concern, highlighting how biometric data collection linked to crypto incentives can cross into national security territory, particularly if foreign entities manage or store sensitive information. Implications for Privacy and Regulation in the Crypto Space The latest development reflects a broader debate around privacy, identity verification, and decentralized finance. Projects like Worldcoin argue that iris scans enable a secure and scalable method of proving human identity online, which could help distinguish real users from automated bots in Web3 applications. Critics, however, have cautioned that once biometric data is collected, the risk of misuse or unauthorized access remains high, even if encrypted or anonymized. China’s public statement suggests that the country may increase oversight of foreign crypto projects operating within its jurisdiction or collecting data from Chinese nationals. This aligns with global regulatory trends, where authorities are seeking to strike a balance between technological innovation and the protection of sensitive personal information. In Europe, data regulators have opened probes into Worldcoin’s activities under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while Kenya temporarily halted Worldcoin registrations over similar privacy concerns in 2023. The MSS has urged the public to exercise caution when approached with offers to exchange personal data for cryptocurrency rewards.

2025-08-07 03:00:44,49670888,1754535644,"Pi Coin Adds Fiat Options, ADA Builds Momentum, BlockDAG Launches Live Trading Simulator as Presale Hits $363M!","Spotting coins with real value before launch is tough. Cardano (ADA) is holding strong near its support zone with slight upside, while Pi Coin (PI) is making headlines through wallet updates aimed at access and usability. Both show movement, but neither offers early access to real market tools or previews of in-action utilities. BlockDAG stands out. Using the TRADEBDAG code, buyers unlock a live trading simulator that mirrors real presale activity. This isn’t about future plans, it’s a hands-on experience now, giving users a better sense of what to expect post-launch. Among trending crypto coins, BlockDAG ’s utility-first approach clearly breaks the mold and brings more engagement early on. BlockDAG’s Live Simulator Previews Market Action! Most early-stage crypto projects rely on promises. BlockDAG flips the script. The TRADEBDAG code gives full access to its Trading Dashboard, a real-time simulator that previews actual BDAG trading post-launch. Users can view BDAG/USD price charts, track the live order book, and place trades that update wallet balances instantly. It brings a working prototype to users’ hands now. This tool isn’t just about trying it out. It allows participants to build trading confidence and understand real market behavior before the official launch. The goal is to shift the presale from passive holding to full user interaction, which makes the experience more exciting and rewarding. BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release makes this more exciting. Although the current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, buyers can use the special GLOBAL LAUNCH rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This opens a potential 3,025% return, based on the confirmed $0.05 launch price. So far, $361 million has been raised, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 1 buyers have already seen a 2,660% ROI. As the presale momentum continues, BlockDAG proves it isn’t just selling a future idea. It’s showing exactly what’s coming next and why it matters for early access users. Pi Wallet Improves Access With Fiat Options A new Pi Wallet update is drawing fresh attention to Pi Coin (PI), especially with features designed to improve access. The wallet now supports payments through Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit cards via Banxa and Onramper. This lowers the entry barrier and makes it easier for users to buy PI with fiat. The update also added a “BUY” button, streamlining user experience and hinting at broader adoption goals. There are also signs that the wallet may support other digital assets soon, which would give it a role beyond the Pi ecosystem. That could reshape how users interact with it long term. Together, these upgrades highlight a broader shift in PI’s direction. The team is clearly focused on improving access, building infrastructure, and supporting mainstream use. While exchange listings are still pending, the current updates help PI stay visible among trending crypto picks that focus on usability and interface experience. ADA Bounces Back From $0.69 Support Cardano (ADA) dropped from $0.83 to nearly $0.69 between July 28 and August 2, showing six straight days of red candles. This drop tested the long-standing $0.69 support level and caught traders’ attention due to its consistent decline. Since then, ADA has recovered with two green sessions and now trades close to $0.73. ADA is currently stuck inside a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Analysts are watching the $0.72 to $0.73 range as a key breakout zone. If ADA moves higher, it could touch $0.75 or even $0.80 soon. Under the right conditions, some targets stretch as far as $0.96 by the end of August. Despite recent pressure, ADA’s ability to hold support has caught attention. It remains one of the top coins with long-term upside as traders track potential breakout levels, especially while larger altcoins move sideways or struggle to reclaim momentum. The Bottom Line Pi Coin (PI) is gaining users through wallet updates. Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground at support. But neither gives access to real-time trading before the next phase or lets users test anything ahead of listings. BlockDAG does. The TRADEBDAG code unlocks full use of its Trading Dashboard, where buyers can view price charts, place trades, and see wallet balances shift live. It’s not just testing, it’s real-time simulation based on current presale activity, which provides early training and excitement. For those looking at top crypto coins right now, BlockDAG offers a working product, not just future potential. With its $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release valid till August 11, BlockDAG puts real tools and opportunity directly in users’ hands, turning curiosity into real engagement before market listings go live.

2025-08-07 03:00:39,49668135,1754535639,China Greenlights Launch Of Its First Crypto Stablecoin—Report,"As part of an initiative to internationalize the renminbi (Chinese Yuan) and enhance its competitiveness against the US dollar, China is poised to launch its first stablecoin. Meanwhile, the US is making significant progress toward its mission of becoming the crypto capital of the world. Despite this ambitious plan, concerns about potential capital flight are reportedly hindering the rapid advancement of stablecoin technology within the country. China Explores Stablecoin Initiatives According to a report from the Financial Times, Hong Kong has emerged as a testing ground for cryptocurrency, particularly given the strict bans on the mainland. Recently, the territory passed legislation allowing licensed businesses to issue tokens backed by any fiat currency. However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken a cautious stance, indicating that only a limited number of licenses will be issued starting next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insult Alert: Pro Trader Dubs HODLers ‘Idiots,’ Saylor Fires Back Policymakers in China have increasingly turned their attention to stablecoins, recognizing the growing dominance of dollar-backed tokens in the global economy. The central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, noted in a June speech that stablecoins have “fundamentally reshaped the traditional payment landscape.” However, the Chinese government faces a delicate balancing act; while it seeks to enhance the global standing of the renminbi, it must also maintain stringent controls over its financial system. Recent discussions among financial regulators have centered on the implementation of stablecoin projects, emphasizing that any such initiative must align with China’s unique national conditions. Yet, experts have cautioned that the risks associated with capital outflows could pose significant challenges. Interest Grows In Hong Kong Rebecca Liao, CEO of Saga, a company focused on blockchain infrastructure, articulated the complexities of adopting stablecoin technology, highlighting that it cannot be completely controlled by central authorities. This concern has contributed to Hong Kong’s slower progress in developing a thriving stablecoin market, especially when compared to the rapid growth observed in the United States. The HKMA has voiced apprehensions about the potential use of stablecoins in money laundering, emphasizing the need for stability and control in its new regulatory framework. As such, initial stablecoin programs in Hong Kong are expected to focus on business-to-business applications, limiting their broader adoption. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? Expert Reveals Strategy’s Alleged Plan To Sell All BTC Holdings The report emphasizes that interest in stablecoins is also growing among Chinese state-owned enterprises, particularly in the context of payment and settlement solutions. Multiple state-owned companies with operations in Hong Kong are reportedly looking to apply for stablecoin licenses, although only one of China’s four major state-owned banks is expected to receive a license from the HKMA in this initial phase. The HKMA has not ruled out the possibility of approving licenses for stablecoins backed by offshore renminbi, a move that could further facilitate cross-border payments—an area of increasing importance for China.

In July 2025, the blockchain payments giant filed for a charter to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, a limited-purpose national trust bank headquartered in New York. The goal: provide enterprise-grade custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management—without operating as a traditional deposit-taking bank. The move includes a request for a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would allow Ripple to directly access the U.S. payment system for settlement, a leap forward in integrating crypto into traditional banking. While the bank is still awaiting final regulatory approval, the announcement has already reignited market speculation, particularly around Ripple’s native token XRP and major assets like Ethereum. Meanwhile, early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching tailwinds from the broader surge in institutional interest. XRP Testing Key Levels as Market Eyes $3.69 Currently trading between $3.03 and $3.07, XRP recently broke out of a downward channel but is now facing resistance at $3.14 and $3.34. Technical analysts note that a clean breakout above $3.34 could trigger a move toward $3.69 or even higher, particularly if regulatory clarity continues to improve. Ripple’s proposed bank could accelerate XRP adoption by boosting institutional trust. With a dedicated infrastructure for safeguarding reserves, managing RLUSD (Ripple’s stablecoin), and facilitating cross-border payments, XRP could find itself at the center of a more regulated and scalable payment system. The bullish scenario? A legal victory combined with a banking license approval—two catalysts that could launch XRP toward new highs. Ethereum Approaches $4,000 as Bulls Take Control Ethereum is trading strong between $3,555 and $3,720. After gaining more than 40% in the past month, ETH is showing resilience amid broader market volatility. Key resistance lies at $3,881 and $4,234, and analysts remain bullish provided ETH continues to defend the $3,400 range. Ethereum stands to benefit indirectly from Ripple’s banking play as well, given the broader legitimization of tokenized infrastructure and blockchain-integrated banking services. With ETH’s growing presence in tokenized treasuries, stablecoins, and DeFi infrastructure, any movement toward regulatory clarity tends to strengthen Ethereum’s investment case. Momentum with Fresh Capital Rotation into Breakout Contenders Ripple’s growing institutional influence is prompting early investors to explore the next big opportunity—especially among projects still in presale. That shift has brought major attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently experienced a surge in whale inflows and early staking momentum. Ripple’s Trust Bank Launch Could Fuel MAGACOIN FINANCE 22,500% Gains—Outpacing XRP Projections , according to some analysts. The project is riding the wave of rising institutional appetite with a meme-fueled narrative, early timing, and strategic accumulation that’s beginning to resemble early DOGE and SHIBA cycles. Investors seeking asymmetrical upside are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely as ETF-driven inflows trickle down to presale markets. Conclusion: Ripple’s Banking Play Sets the Stage Ripple’s National Trust Bank proposal isn’t just another crypto headline—it’s a signal that blockchain is entering Wall Street’s core financial architecture. If approved, it could catapult XRP and ETH to new heights—and in doing so, may fuel a new generation of breakout altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already capturing that energy, one wallet at a time.

This transaction highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets and the substantial gains possible for long-term holders. Unpacking the Massive James Wo ETH Sale: What Happened? An address believed to belong to James Wo has offloaded all its Ethereum holdings, marking a substantial transaction. Over the past two days, a total of 3,634.2 ETH, valued at approximately $13.29 million, found its way to Binance Exchange. This particular stash of Ethereum was accumulated back in February 2023, with an average acquisition cost of $1521.95 per ETH.

This strategic divestment has resulted in an estimated profit of $7.796 million, a truly remarkable gain from their initial Ethereum holdings . Such a move by a prominent figure often sparks widespread discussion within the crypto community. The Role of On-Chain Analysis in Uncovering Major Moves How do we know about such large-scale transactions? This information comes to light thanks to meticulous on-chain analysis . Experts like @ai_9684xtpa on X actively monitor blockchain data, tracking the movement of significant cryptocurrency amounts. This transparency is a core feature of public blockchains, allowing anyone with the right tools to observe transactions. On-chain data provides invaluable insights into market trends, potential whale movements, and shifts in investor sentiment.

This event, brought to light through diligent on-chain analysis , showcases a substantial crypto whale profit from long-held Ethereum holdings .

2025-08-07 02:46:58,49669682,1754534818,USDC Leads 3x Rise in Crypto-Based Salary Payments Over Past Year: Survey,"The share of workers paid in cryptocurrency has more than tripled over the past year, with USDC emerging as the most popular digital asset for payroll, according to Pantera Capital’s 2024 Blockchain Compensation Survey . In 2023, only 3% of respondents reported receiving any part of their salary in crypto. That figure jumped to 9.6% in 2024, as blockchain-native firms and DAOs increasingly turned to stablecoins and tokens to compensate employees and contributors. At the same time, the share of workers paid exclusively in fiat dropped from 97% to 89.1%. This shift shows a broader willingness among companies to integrate digital assets into day-to-day operations, particularly in roles that span borders or operate within decentralized ecosystems. Stablecoins Become Standard for Crypto Wages, USDC in Front Among those receiving crypto compensation, USDC was the dominant choice. The dollar-pegged stablecoin accounted for 63% of all crypto salaries, far outpacing USDT , which held a 28.6% share. Other tokens like Solana and Ethereum made up a smaller slice, with 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Our mission is to support the long-term success of both our portfolio companies and the broader crypto ecosystem. One major gap we’ve consistently seen? Reliable, transparent compensation data for crypto teams. That’s why we created our annual Crypto Compensation Survey – a… — Pantera Capital (@PanteraCapital) August 6, 2025 Pantera’s survey covers blockchain engineers, product managers, legal and operations staff across the industry. The results suggest that stablecoins are no longer limited to trading pairs or DeFi use cases, but are also becoming a practical tool for payroll and international payments. USDC Adoption in Payroll Strengthened by Monthly Reserve Disclosures Crypto compensation offers several advantages, especially for globally distributed teams. Stablecoins enable faster settlement times, lower transaction fees and easier access to US dollar value in regions with banking restrictions or currency instability. The findings also point to growing confidence in USDC’s reputation for regulatory compliance and transparency, particularly after Circle, its issuer, began publishing detailed monthly reserve reports and secured access to US Treasuries. More Workers Opt to Split Salaries Between Cash and Crypto While full salary payments in crypto remain uncommon, hybrid arrangements are gaining traction. Many firms now allow employees to split their compensation between fiat and digital assets, giving workers the option to dollar-cost average into crypto markets or spend directly using Web3 wallets. Pantera’s report did not disclose regional trends, but the surge in crypto salaries is likely driven in part by Asia-based teams and contractors who rely on stablecoins for cost-effective cross-border payments. The rise of on-chain compensation also comes as more crypto-native companies formalize operations. With better treasury management tools, real-time payroll rails and accounting platforms tailored for digital assets, the logistical barriers to paying in crypto are beginning to fall.

2025-08-07 02:45:11,49669574,1754534711,U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Witness Impressive $34.15M Inflow Surge,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Witness Impressive $34.15M Inflow Surge The world of digital assets is buzzing! Recently, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a remarkable influx of capital, with a combined net inflow of $34.15 million on August 6. This significant event marks the second consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed financial products. This trend highlights a crucial shift in how traditional investors are engaging with the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. What’s Driving These Ethereum ETF Inflows? This impressive surge in Ethereum ETF inflows didn’t happen by chance. Data shared by Trader T reveals that key players are actively accumulating positions. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s ETHA, which alone attracted a substantial $32.41 million in inflows. This demonstrates strong institutional appetite for regulated crypto exposure. BlackRock’s ETHA: Dominant with $32.41 million in inflows. Grayscale’s ETHE: Added $10.04 million, showing continued interest in established products. ARK 21Shares’ CETH: Contributed $0.37 million, rounding out the positive contributors. However, it wasn’t universally positive. Grayscale’s mini ETH experienced a net outflow of $8.67 million. This suggests some investors might be reallocating within their Ethereum holdings or optimizing their exposure strategies. Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining a steady stance. Understanding the Impact on ETH ETF Performance The consistent positive flow, particularly the second consecutive day of net inflows, is a strong indicator of robust ETH ETF performance . It reflects increasing comfort among institutional and retail investors with regulated vehicles for accessing Ethereum’s potential. This trend can lead to greater market stability and broader acceptance of digital assets. Why is this important? When large investment firms like BlackRock see significant inflows into their products, it often validates the underlying asset. For Ethereum, this means more capital is being directly channeled into its ecosystem, potentially boosting liquidity and market cap over time. It also signifies a maturing market where traditional finance is increasingly intertwined with decentralized technologies. How Do These Inflows Affect the Broader Crypto ETF Market? The success of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has ripple effects across the entire crypto ETF market . Positive performance in one segment, especially a major one like Ethereum, often inspires confidence in other digital asset products. This can pave the way for more diverse crypto ETF offerings in the future, expanding options for investors seeking exposure to various cryptocurrencies without direct ownership. This institutional embrace through ETFs helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. It provides a regulated, accessible pathway for a wider range of investors, from large funds to individual retirement accounts, to participate in the growth of digital assets. This legitimization is crucial for the long-term health and expansion of the crypto market. The Future of Digital Asset Investment Looks Bright These recent inflows underscore a growing appetite for digital asset investment . The ability to invest in Ethereum through regulated ETF products offers significant advantages, including ease of access, liquidity, and oversight. As the market matures, we can expect to see continued innovation in financial products that cater to diverse investor needs. The transparency provided by ETF structures also builds trust. Investors can track holdings and performance easily, fostering a more informed and secure investment environment. This positive momentum for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could be a precursor to even greater institutional adoption and innovation in the broader digital asset space. In conclusion, the substantial $34.15 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 6 marks a pivotal moment.

2025-08-07 02:40:10,49669444,1754534410,US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $91.52 Million Inflow Surge,"BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $91.52 Million Inflow Surge Good news for the crypto market! After a period of quiet, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have made a significant comeback. On August 6, these investment vehicles collectively saw a substantial net inflow of $91.52 million. This positive shift is particularly noteworthy as it broke a five-day streak of net outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence in the digital asset space and specifically in spot Bitcoin investment products. What Drove the Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The latest data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of this encouraging trend. The $91.52 million in total net inflows marks a decisive turn for Bitcoin ETF inflows . This isn’t just a small bump; it’s a significant indicator that institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels is regaining momentum. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack, attracting a robust $41.9 million in inflows. Bitwise’s BITB followed closely, securing $26.35 million. Grayscale’s GBTC , despite its higher fees, managed to pull in $14.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC added $10.06 million to its coffers. VanEck’s HODL contributed with $4.08 million in inflows. Interestingly, not all funds experienced inflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB saw a net outflow of $5.37 million on the same day. However, the overall picture remains overwhelmingly positive, with the majority of major players showing strong net gains. Understanding BTC ETF Performance: A Closer Look This surge in inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a critical aspect of the evolving cryptocurrency market: the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional finance. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This convenience and regulatory oversight are key attractions for a broad range of investors, from large institutions to individual traders. The daily flow data provides a real-time pulse of market sentiment. When funds like BlackRock and Fidelity, major players in traditional finance, see consistent inflows, it suggests a broader shift towards embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This positive BTC ETF performance can also influence broader market sentiment for Bitcoin itself, potentially leading to increased price stability or even upward momentum. What’s Next for Crypto ETF Trends? The August 6th inflows offer a glimmer of optimism, but what does this mean for future crypto ETF trends ? While one day’s data doesn’t establish a long-term pattern, it certainly provides a hopeful sign. Investors and analysts will be closely watching subsequent days’ performance to see if this trend of net inflows continues or if it was an isolated event. Continued inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs could indicate: Increased Institutional Adoption: More institutions might be allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products. Renewed Retail Interest: Individual investors, perhaps waiting for clearer market signals, might be re-entering the market. Market Maturity: The consistent use of ETFs suggests the market is maturing and becoming more accessible. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. External economic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact these flows. Monitoring these trends is crucial for anyone involved in digital asset investment. Conclusion: A Positive Shift for Spot Bitcoin Investment The $91.52 million net inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 6 is a welcome development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It marks an end to a period of outflows and showcases renewed confidence from investors across various funds. While the journey of digital assets in traditional finance is still unfolding, this positive turn in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a strong indicator of growing interest and potential stability for the market. It underscores the increasing importance of regulated investment products in making Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience, paving the way for further mainstream adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a US spot Bitcoin ETF? A US spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. These funds trade on traditional stock exchanges. Why are net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs important? Net inflows indicate that more money is entering these funds than leaving them. This suggests increasing investor demand and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, particularly through regulated investment vehicles. It can also be a positive sign for Bitcoin’s price. Which US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw the most inflows on August 6? On August 6, BlackRock’s IBIT led with $41.9 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise’s BITB ($26.35 million), Grayscale’s GBTC ($14.5 million), Fidelity’s FBTC ($10.06 million), and VanEck’s HODL ($4.08 million). Do all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows? No, not all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows simultaneously. On August 6, for example, ARK Invest’s ARKB saw net outflows. Fund performance can vary based on investor preference, fees, and specific fund strategies. How do Bitcoin ETF inflows impact the broader crypto market? Significant and sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can signal growing institutional and retail interest, potentially leading to increased liquidity, greater price stability, and overall positive sentiment for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.

2025-08-07 02:27:54,49668968,1754533674,Bitcoin Price Prediction: $218M Satsuma Raise and SMA Retest Hint at $123K Breakout,"Bitcoin is trading just above $114,000, defending its ascending trendline and 50-day SMA, a key confluence zone that traders often watch for bullish continuation. This technical retest comes as institutional momentum heats up: Satsuma Technology just raised $218 million in BTC-denominated funding, adding to a broader wave of long-term capital moving into Bitcoin. With higher lows forming since April and major players like pension funds and SBI Holdings expanding crypto exposure, the setup for a breakout toward $123K is becoming harder to ignore. Satsuma’s Bold Bitcoin Bet London-based Satsuma Technology has made headlines with a $217.6 million convertible credit note , the first of its kind in the UK to be fully subscribed in Bitcoin. This funding round, backed by Pantera Capital, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and UK asset managers overseeing more than £300 billion, outperformed its target by 63%. JUST IN: Satsuma Technology raises $217.6M to expand Bitcoin treasury strategy. pic.twitter.com/t0bFAv80Qy — ChainDesk (@ChainDesk_) August 6, 2025 Despite the positive momentum, Satsuma’s stock slipped 14%, a move analysts attribute to profit-taking and short-term volatility. CEO Henry Elder confirmed the capital will support their plan to fuse decentralized AI infrastructure via Bittensor with a Bitcoin-native treasury strategy. Currently holding 1,126 BTC at an average entry of $115,149, Satsuma’s position is nearly break-even, reflecting firm conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory amid broader market turbulence. The raise aligns with a growing macro trend: $7.8 billion in crypto asset acquisitions were disclosed last week, with $2.7 billion flowing into Bitcoin alone. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Setup Points to Breakout Bitcoin is showing notable technical strength. Price action around $114,980 is consolidating just above two key supports: The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $112,860 Long-term ascending trendline stretching back to April. This confluence zone, where resistance has flipped into support, is often a bullish continuation signal. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview RSI is about to cross above 50, which could be the start of the bullish momentum. The chart shows a broad ascending triangle with higher lows and accumulation below $123,206. A break above this level could unleash the buyers towards $131,337 and $138,680. If the trendline holds, it’s a stair-step rally. But if it breaks below $111,995 it could shift the sentiment and open the door for a drop to $105,225 or $99,500. Volume confirmation and a bullish engulfing candle above $115,000 would be the perfect entry for swing traders. BTC Trade Setup (Short-Term): Entry: Break above $115,000 Targets: $123,200 Stop-Loss: Below $113,800 If this triangle breakout confirms, bulls could regain control, especially if paired with renewed institutional inflows and ETF stability. Institutions Double Down on BTC In the U.S., the Michigan State Retirement System just tripled its Bitcoin ETF exposure, adding 200,000 shares of the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF to its portfolio, now valued at $11.4 million. This comes despite over $1.4 billion in outflows across U.S. ETFs last week, signaling long-term conviction. Michigan also holds $13.6 million in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust , unchanged since 2024. Though crypto remains a small slice of its $19.3 billion portfolio, analysts say the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is increasingly attractive for pension strategies seeking asymmetric returns with manageable risk. Michigan State Pension Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure, Latest Filing Shows ► https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ — Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) August 6, 2025 Across the Pacific, Japan’s SBI Holdings is awaiting approval for the country’s first Bitcoin-XRP ETF. If greenlit, it would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange — unlocking institutional access in a tightly regulated market. A second ETF, blending gold and crypto, is also in the pipeline. These developments could dramatically boost Asian inflows, especially if Japan’s Financial Services Agency reclassifies crypto under the FIEA statute — a shift that could redefine institutional access across the region. What’s Next for BTC? With BTC holding support near $115K and institutional narratives strengthening across the U.S., U.K., and Japan, the foundation is set for a bullish continuation. If the ascending triangle plays out, Bitcoin could break through $123K resistance and revisit $131K or $138K in the near term and possibly set the stage for a Q4 run toward $250K or higher.

2025-08-07 02:25:10,49668917,1754533510,Ethereum Accumulation Surges: Spot ETH ETFs & Treasuries Grab 3.2% of Total Supply,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Accumulation Surges: Spot ETH ETFs & Treasuries Grab 3.2% of Total Supply Exciting news is rippling through the cryptocurrency world! A significant wave of Ethereum accumulation is underway, with institutional players and corporate treasuries making substantial moves into the ETH market. This trend signals a maturing digital asset landscape and could have profound implications for the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency. What’s Driving This Significant Spot ETH ETFs & Treasury Inflow? Nate Geraci, the respected president of NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly The ETF Store), recently shared compelling data on X. His report highlights a remarkable trend: since early June, companies holding Ethereum in their treasuries and newly emerging spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total Ethereum supply. This combined effort represents a staggering 3.2% of all ETH. Such a substantial absorption of tokens by these entities is a strong indicator of growing institutional confidence. It also suggests a long-term investment perspective rather than speculative trading. This steady inflow points to a strategic move by major players to secure a significant portion of the network’s native asset. It reflects a belief in Ethereum’s foundational technology and its potential for future growth. The Impact on ETH Supply and Market Dynamics When large entities like corporate treasuries and exchange-traded funds start buying up a significant percentage of an asset, it naturally impacts the available ETH supply . Here’s why this matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: As more ETH moves into long-term holdings and ETF reserves, less of it is available for day-to-day trading on exchanges. Potential Price Pressure: A reduced supply, coupled with sustained demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum’s price over time. This is a fundamental economic principle. Market Validation: Institutional buying provides a strong vote of confidence. It validates Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class, attracting further investment from traditional finance. This ongoing accumulation acts as a powerful signal to the broader market. It suggests that major financial players are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to digital assets, especially those with strong utility like Ethereum. Who Are These Ethereum Treasuries and Why Does It Matter? The term ‘ Ethereum treasuries ‘ refers to companies that hold ETH as part of their corporate reserves, similar to how they might hold cash, gold, or other traditional assets. This practice has gained traction as more businesses recognize the potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Why is this significant? Diversification: Companies are diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets. Strategic Alignment: For many, holding ETH aligns with their business strategies, particularly those involved in Web3, NFTs, or DeFi. Long-Term Horizon: These are typically not short-term speculative plays but rather long-term strategic investments, implying a belief in Ethereum’s enduring value. The emergence of spot ETH ETFs also provides a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This bridges the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market. The Future of Institutional Ethereum Investment: What’s Next? The recent surge in institutional Ethereum accumulation, highlighted by Nate Geraci’s report, paints a clear picture: major financial players are taking Ethereum seriously. This trend is likely to continue as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional investment vehicles become available. What can we expect going forward? Continued ETF Growth: As more spot ETH ETFs launch globally, they will likely continue to absorb a significant portion of the available supply. Broader Corporate Adoption: More companies may follow suit, adding ETH to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or as a strategic asset. Increased Market Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can contribute to greater market stability by reducing volatility often associated with retail speculation. This systematic accumulation by well-funded entities underscores Ethereum’s evolving role from a niche digital asset to a recognized, investable asset class within the global financial system. It’s a testament to the network’s robust ecosystem and its potential for widespread adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum The collective efforts of spot ETH ETFs and corporate treasuries to acquire 3.2% of the total ETH supply since June mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. This significant Ethereum accumulation by institutional players signals a profound shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. As more of the ETH supply is locked away in long-term holdings, the stage is set for a future where institutional Ethereum plays an even more dominant role in shaping the market. This ongoing trend not only validates Ethereum’s position but also paves the way for greater stability and mainstream integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum accumulation by treasuries and spot ETH ETFs? Ethereum accumulation by treasuries refers to companies holding ETH as part of their corporate balance sheets. Spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that hold actual Ethereum, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. Both are actively acquiring significant amounts of ETH. Q2: How much of the total ETH supply has been acquired by these entities since June? According to Nate Geraci’s report, corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total ETH supply, leading to a combined Ethereum accumulation of roughly 3.2%. Q3: What impact does this accumulation have on the overall ETH supply? This significant accumulation reduces the amount of ETH supply available on exchanges for trading. This can lead to increased scarcity, potentially putting upward pressure on Ethereum’s price if demand remains strong or grows. Q4: Why are companies adding Ethereum to their treasuries? Companies are adding Ethereum to their Ethereum treasuries for various reasons, including diversification of assets, strategic alignment with Web3 or blockchain initiatives, and as a long-term investment believing in Ethereum’s future growth and utility. Q5: Does this institutional interest mean Ethereum is becoming more stable? Yes, the increasing involvement of institutional Ethereum investors, particularly those with long-term holding strategies, can contribute to greater market stability. Their large, less volatile holdings can help cushion price swings often associated with retail trading. Did you find this article insightful?

2025-08-07 02:15:18,49668659,1754532918,Top 3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy During the Dip,"As the market cools off, savvy investors are eyeing strategic entries before the next major leg up. With Ripple’s banking initiative nearing launch and a potential XRP ETF approval looming, the crypto landscape is primed for movement. Seasoned traders know that dips often present the best buying opportunities—especially when paired with strong catalysts. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as a sleeper pick . Still in its presale stage, this low-cap project is drawing early comparisons to top performers from previous cycles. XRP’s ETF Catalyst and Bank License Fuel Buying Interest XRP has been regaining momentum as Ripple inches closer to resolving its long-running legal standoff with the U.S. SEC. A $50 million settlement is reportedly in the works, which would clear the path for institutional XRP sales. More significantly, rumors of an XRP ETF filing by BlackRock and other asset managers are ramping up. At the same time, Ripple’s push to secure a banking license is being viewed as a game-changing move. Analysts believe these developments could send XRP back toward the $3 range, with any ETF approval likely triggering a major rally akin to the Bitcoin ETF surge earlier this year. The Altcoin that Draws Early Whales Before Major Listings While large caps like XRP and ADA attract institutional buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the high-ROI altcoin space. Currently in presale, the project has already recorded explosive early growth, with analysts projecting a potential 25x return if momentum continues. The MAGACOIN ecosystem is designed to blend meme coin virality with real-world utility, offering a hybrid approach that’s drawing strong community support. Investors are rushing to secure presale allocations before listings begin, citing similarities to early-stage PEPE and Shiba Inu—with a more strategic roadmap in place. ADA Still Trading Far Below All-Time Highs—But Not for Long Cardano (ADA) has seen relatively quiet price action, but under the surface, excitement is building. The upcoming Midnight airdrop—a privacy-focused sidechain—is driving renewed interest in ADA holders. Historically, major network developments like this have preceded price rallies. Despite past underperformance compared to other top ten assets, ADA remains well below its all-time high near $3. Given its current positioning, any surge in usage or airdrop speculation could unlock a strong recovery, making ADA a solid mid-cap hold during this dip. Conclusion Market pullbacks often separate the emotional traders from the strategic ones. With XRP nearing a resolution, ADA gearing up for airdrop momentum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE blazing through its early stages with explosive projections , this dip may not last long.

2025-08-07 02:00:57,49668406,1754532057,"Bakkt Secures 30% Stake In Marusho Hotta, Rebranding As ‘Bitcoin JP’","Bakkt Holdings (BKKT), a key player in the crypto services sector, has announced a strategic move to acquire approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of MarushoHotta Co., Ltd. (MHT), a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). This massive acquisition, facilitated through a share purchase agreement with metallurgical company RIZAP Group, Inc., positions Bakkt as the largest shareholder of MHT. Incorporating Bitcoin Into MHT’s Treasury Management Plans As announced on Wednesday, part of this transaction will see Phillip Lord, the President of Bakkt International, assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at MHT. Under his leadership, MHT plans to incorporate Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets into its treasury management strategy. Furthermore, Bakkt has secured the domain name www.bitcoin.jp , which, pending approval from MarushoHotta’s shareholders, is set to become the new identity for the company. In a statement, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity, citing Japan’s regulatory environment as a favorable landscape for developing a Bitcoin-centric business model. He emphasized the intention to collaborate closely with MHT’s team to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin into their operational and financial framework , aiming to establish MHT as a foremost Bitcoin treasury company: Japan’s regulatory environment creates an ideal platform for a Bitcoin-centered growth business. We look forward to working with MHT’s team to integrate Bitcoin into their operating and financial model and to establish MHT as a leading Bitcoin treasury company. Bakkt Faces Setbacks As Stock Drops This acquisition aligns with Bakkt’s broader strategy to enhance its Bitcoin holdings. Recently, the company announced plans to raise up to $1 billion through various securities offerings, a move that reflects a growing trend among publicly traded companies to bolster their cryptocurrency reserves. The proposed offering includes shares of Class A common stock and pre-funded warrants, with underwriters being given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 15% of the shares sold, allowing for potential over-allotments. However, the timing, size, and terms of the offering remain contingent on market conditions. Despite these ambitious initiatives, Bakkt has encountered challenges. In March 2025, the company’s stock, BKKT , experienced a significant drop of 30% following news that two major clients, including Bank of America, would not be renewing their financial agreements with Bakkt. As of this writing, BKKT’s valuation closed Wednesday’s trading session at $9.77, up 2.5% for the day. However, the stock is trading over 70% below this year’s high of $31. Looking at a longer time frame, BKKT reached a record high of $1,271 in November 2021, which is nearly a 100% gap, further highlighting the firm’s challenges in recent years.

2025-08-07 02:00:48,49668773,1754532048,"Cold Wallet Sells 682M Coins, Offers 3,600% ROI While XRP Falls Below $0.50 and Stellar Slows Near $0.13","XRP and Stellar are drawing attention again with short-term market moves. XRP is gaining renewed interest as traders adjust positions following news of the ETF delay. Stellar recently led the charts after a breakout rally, briefly pushing past major altcoins. While these price moves get coverage, the real opportunity may lie in platforms offering lasting utility and active user rewards. Cold Wallet is gaining traction on that front. Now in Stage 16 of its presale at just $0.00942, it combines self-custody, real-world utility, and up to 100% cashback. With a launch price set at $0.3517, it gives users a 3,600% return potential. Over 682.8 million coins have already been sold. Rather than hype-based movement, Cold Wallet ($CWT) offers a working system that delivers value daily. It’s shifting focus from price watching to actual use. XRP’s Price Slips as ETF Delay Shifts Focus Elsewhere XRP’s price saw a burst of activity earlier this month, but the momentum didn’t last. The delay in launching the inverse XRP ETF until August 4, 2025, cooled off the rally. Prices briefly spiked to $0.52 before slipping back below $0.50, signaling a dip in short-term confidence. For now, XRP’s next moves depend more on regulation than innovation. XRP still holds recognition in the crypto space, but its growth is now tied to external decisions. Without strong internal developments or fresh updates, many traders are pausing. Interest is shifting to platforms that offer benefits based on user engagement rather than news. Cold Wallet stands out for this reason. While XRP’s future depends on ETF rulings, Cold Wallet is already a rewarding activity. With cashback and clear usage incentives, it offers a dependable alternative. It’s building steady traction, powered not by speculation but by function. As users look for projects offering more than just headlines, Cold Wallet is making its way to the top. Stellar Slows Down After Brief Rally Fails to Hold Stellar made waves with a massive 63% rally over the past week, briefly outperforming many other altcoins. The run was fueled by renewed interest in Stellar’s role in remittance services and increased trade volumes. However, the rally ran into resistance as prices neared $0.13. Now, many see the coin entering a sideways consolidation phase, suggesting that the move may have peaked. Even with fast transaction times and low fees, Stellar’s offerings no longer feel unique in today’s Layer 1 space. Without major changes or upgrades, it risks fading from attention. The excitement around Stellar’s rise may weaken unless backed by deeper ecosystem growth. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, doesn’t depend on price spikes. It rewards every transaction through cashback tiers. This utility-first model continues working even during sideways markets. While Stellar stalls, Cold Wallet gives active users a reason to stay engaged and earn with every action. Cold Wallet Turns Daily Crypto Use Into Cashback and 50x Returns Cold Wallet fixes one of crypto’s biggest problems, transaction fees that punish users for staying active. Most platforms take value from the user, especially on swaps, gas fees, or fiat ramps. Cold Wallet reverses that idea. Every action within the app earns $CWT, the utility coin that powers its cashback model. At Stage 16 of presale, it’s priced at $0.00942. The launch value is fixed at $0.3517, creating a return of 3,600% for early supporters. But the appeal isn’t just upside. Cold Wallet gives users a direct way to earn on activity. Holding more $CWT unlocks greater cashback rewards, up to 100%. No staking. No lock-ins. Just use the platform and earn. It includes four loyalty tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Top-tier users receive full gas refunds and 50% cashback on swap and ramp fees. This system benefits people who actually use the wallet daily, not just large holders waiting on price moves. More than 682.8 million coins have already been sold, and the project has raised $5.6 million. With referral rewards that give both sides something and cashback that activates without delay, Cold Wallet is building a model centered on value returned to the user. It isn’t a wallet you just store crypto in, it’s one that works for you every day. Cold Wallet Brings Practical Value While Others Wait As XRP’s progress stalls due to delayed ETF news and Stellar’s rally hits resistance, Cold Wallet is quietly building something more sustainable. It rewards users for actual activity, not just holding. With a 3,600% ROI opportunity, cashback on fees, and over 682.8 million coins sold, it’s already proving itself. Cold Wallet doesn’t rely on speculation or external triggers. Its model puts value back in users’ hands, creating daily utility that works across all market conditions. While other platforms wait for catalysts, Cold Wallet continues gaining traction through function, making it one of the most practical and promising presale crypto plays today.

2025-08-07 02:00:19,49668074,1754532019,Indonesia Mulls Bitcoin Reserves as Brazil Joins Talks on Strategic Crypto Holdings,"Indonesia and Brazil are taking a bold step toward modernizing their economic strategy by exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin in their national reserves. In a high-level meeting with Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka’s office, representatives from Bitcoin Indonesia presented a detailed proposal outlining how the country could use surplus renewable energy to mine and accumulate Bitcoin as part of a long-term economic development plan. Indonesian Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Move Despite stringent crypto tax policies and a nationwide ban on using crypto for payments, Indonesian officials are reportedly receptive to the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for the economy. A key component of the discussion involved the importance of public education, with Bitcoin Indonesia advocating for awareness programs to improve understanding of Bitcoin’s economic potential. The group also shared macroeconomic projections, including Michael Saylor’s bullish forecast of Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. With a stable inflation rate of 0.76% and a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 39%, Indonesia’s interest in Bitcoin is not driven by economic desperation but rather by a strategic vision to diversify its reserves and leverage untapped geothermal and hydroelectric energy for sustainable mining. Brazil Moves Forward with Crypto Reserve Legislation While Indonesia explores its options, Brazil is already advancing a national conversation on Bitcoin reserves . The country’s House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing on August 20 to debate a bill that could allow up to 5% of its treasury, approximately $15 billion, to be allocated to Bitcoin. Six key institutions, including Brazil’s central bank and finance ministry, will participate in the discussions. Though the bill faces opposition from some financial authorities, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin’s office has endorsed it as being in the national interest. This marks Brazil’s first-ever public hearing on crypto reserves and underscores a growing global shift toward the institutionalization of Bitcoin. A Global Trend Toward Sovereign Bitcoin Holdings Indonesia and Brazil join a growing list of nations, including the United States, Ukraine, Bhutan, and Kazakhstan, that are actively exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. While motivations vary, from hedging against inflation to modernizing financial infrastructure, the trend is clear: sovereign Bitcoin reserves are no longer a fringe idea. As more governments assess the potential of digital assets, Bitcoin’s role in national economic strategies appears poised to grow significantly, signaling a transformative era in global finance.

2025-08-07 02:00:13,49668069,1754532013,Ethereum Nears Make-or-Break Moment as Open Interest Soars to All-Time High,"Ethereum (ETH) has mirrored the broader cryptocurrency market’s recent downturn, with its price declining by 4% over the past week. As of today, ETH trades at approximately $3,598, reflecting a 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. This pullback follows months of mixed price action across the market, as traders balance optimism over long-term fundamentals with short-term risk management. New insights from on-chain data suggest heightened market activity surrounding Ethereum despite its failure to reclaim the $4,000 mark. Analysts point to unprecedented levels of Open Interest (OI) in Ethereum futures contracts, combined with record daily transactions on its network. While this signals growing participation and network adoption, it also raises concerns about potential volatility if market sentiment shifts abruptly. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Falters Above $3,700 – Is a Pullback Brewing? Ethereum Open Interest Hits All-Time High CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain reported that Ethereum’s OI on Binance has recently reached a record-breaking $77 billion. Open Interest measures the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, providing insight into market activity and trader participation. The surge suggests that more capital is entering ETH futures markets, potentially setting the stage for significant price movements. This rise in OI coincides with Ethereum reaching its highest daily transaction count ever recorded. Analysts link this spike in activity to increased engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth in layer-2 scaling solutions, and broader adoption of Ethereum-based applications. CryptoOnchain noted that such developments “highlight growing participation and user engagement,” adding that this type of market buildup often precedes sharp price trends, either upward or downward. However, this accumulation of leveraged positions carries risk. If price movements turn unfavorable for the majority of open contracts, a wave of liquidations could occur, amplifying volatility. This has been a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency market, where leveraged positions can trigger cascading sell-offs during sudden price corrections. Bearish Signals Emerge from Market Order Activity Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, highlighted a different indicator that reflects short-term market pressure on Ethereum. According to his data, Net Taker Volume for ETH stood at -$418.8 million daily. This figure represents roughly 115,400 more ETH sold via market orders than bought, indicating a clear imbalance in favor of sellers. Market orders, unlike limit orders, execute trades immediately at the best available price. A sustained negative Net Taker Volume often signals urgency among sellers, potentially foreshadowing further downside if buy-side demand fails to absorb the selling pressure. Maartunn explained that “such behavior indicates participants were willing to prioritize execution speed over price,” typically a bearish market sign.

2025-08-07 01:44:47,49667591,1754531087,Ripple CTO Schwartz sets record straight on Caitlin Long’s ‘XRP ICO’ claim,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has publicly responded to comments made by Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, who recently questioned the origins, direction, and integrity of Ripple’s projects—including the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the XRP token, and Ripple’s newly announced stablecoin RLUSD. During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the company behind XRP. She alleged that the company had fallen short of its initial mission, replacing traditional banking, specifically the SWIFT network. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple’s past had “all the makings” of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger. Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. “I’m available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.” He wrote . Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which “sets the record straight” and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information. XRPL validator rejects ‘ICO’ allegations The validator, Vet ( @Vet_X0 ), strongly rejected Caitlin Long’s characterization of XRP as the result of an initial coin offering (ICO). He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently. Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Instead, when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens was placed in a genesis account. At that time, the tokens had no monetary value and no public sale or capital raise. This counters Long’s claim that XRP’s origins are comparable to projects like Ethereum, which conducted a well-documented public ICO in 2014, raising funds in Bitcoin to distribute ETH to early backers. Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger. Vet said Long’s comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. He said that XRP Ledger is open-source and decentralized, and that anyone could run a validator or fork the code. Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can’t update the network unaided. Ripple expands RLUSD to both Ethereum and XRPL Caitlin Long is concerned that the choice made by Ripple to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum contradicts its original vision of using the XRP Ledger as the backbone of global finance. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn’t trusting in its infrastructure. XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. He stressed that this isn’t a move away from XRPL but rather a pragmatic attempt to enhance liquidity and target a more diverse audience across other blockchain ecosystems. According to Vet, Ripple Payments and RLUSD continue to operate natively on the XRP Ledger, and Ethereum’s involvement merely complements—not replaces—the network’s capabilities. Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL’s long-standing technical leadership. He noted that the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to embed a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts. Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.

The decision will be announced at 12 p.m. in London, followed by a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey at 12:30 p.m. The rate cut would mark the fifth consecutive quarter-point reduction, bringing UK rates below those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which last moved in 2024 and currently holds its benchmark at 4.25%–4.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to stick with its cautious guidance of “gradual and careful” reductions, as inflation pressures re-emerge. June inflation came in at 3.6%, higher than the bank’s 3.4% forecast and its highest reading in 17 months, driven by surging energy and food prices. The BoE may now revise its near-term inflation outlook closer to 4% for the year. Governor Bailey has downplayed the spike as temporary, but Chief Economist Huw Pill and others have warned of second-round effects feeding into wages and core inflation. BoE faces mounting growth risks as job losses soar Meanwhile, growth concerns have intensified following back-to-back contractions in the spring and rising unemployment tied to April’s payroll tax and minimum wage hikes. More than 180,000 jobs have been lost since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a £26 billion increase in employer national insurance contributions, pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year high. The MPC is expected to highlight these labour market challenges in its updated projections. In May, it forecast growth of 1% in 2025 and 1.25% in 2026, though recent data suggests a potential upward revision after better-than-expected Q1 performance and an upgraded estimate for Q2 growth. The decision is likely to expose divisions within the nine-member MPC. A Bloomberg survey suggests a three-way split: most members favouring a 25bp cut, two pushing for a larger 50bp move, and two likely to vote for no change. Pill and external member Catherine Mann, who opposed cuts in May, are expected to maintain their stance, while Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor may advocate for a more aggressive reduction. While today’s move is mostly priced in, traders will be watching closely for any change in forward guidance. Markets expect one more cut this year, likely in November, bringing the rate down to around 3.5% by 2026. “The risks are tilted in a hawkish direction,” said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. “The committee may signal it’s rethinking its once-a-quarter pace, implying a November cut isn’t guaranteed.” BoE reconsiders bond sales strategy as long-dated gilt yields surge Attention is also turning to the BoE’s balance sheet reduction strategy. Quantitative tightening (QT) has already reduced bond holdings by about £100 billion annually, but market strain—especially in long-dated gilts—has sparked speculation that the BoE could slow or shift the pace of sales. Governor Bailey has recently flagged concerns over rising 30-year gilt yields, reaching levels last seen in the late 1990s. A pivot toward shorter-dated debt or a reduced pace of active sales (currently expected at £26 billion a year) may be under consideration ahead of the BoE’s September QT update. According to Sanjay Raja, Chief UK Economist at Deutsche Bank, a signal acknowledging long-end liquidity issues could foreshadow changes in the BoE’s sales strategy.

2025-08-07 01:30:23,49668534,1754530223,Asia Morning Briefing: Bitcoin Slips Into Low-Liquidity 'Air Gap' as Post-ATH Drift Continues,"Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) is treading water around $115,000 on Thursday morning in Asia, up 1% in the last 24 hours, as the post-all-time-high correction continues to play out across low volume and weak conviction. According to Glassnode , BTC has entered what it calls an “air gap”, a low-liquidity zone between $110,000 and $116,000, after breaking down from a major supply cluster where short-term holders had previously found support. These areas typically see little trading activity and can either serve as a base for accumulation or become a trapdoor for deeper downside if demand fails to return. “The market is effectively re-finding its footing,” Glassnode analysts wrote, describing the range between $110,000 (the prior ATH) and $116,000 (recent buyer cost basis) as the new battleground. They noted that while opportunistic buying has emerged, with 120,000 BTC acquired on the dip, prices have yet to reclaim resistance levels convincingly, particularly the $116,900 threshold that marks recent short-term holder entry points. Short-term holder profitability has dropped from 100% to 70%, which Glassnode frames as typical for a bull market mid-phase. But without fresh inflows, this could quickly erode sentiment. ETF flows have turned negative, with a 1,500 BTC outflow earlier this week, the largest since April. At the same time, funding rates in the derivatives market have cooled, reflecting reduced leverage and a more cautious stance among speculators. Market maker Enflux offered a similar take: “Crypto markets remain in a fragile holding pattern. Despite some relief in the altcoin space, majors like BTC and ETH are still struggling to inspire confidence,” it wrote in a client note. “The broader trend? Heavy legs with more or less light volume.” ETH is up 2% in the last 24 hours, trading just below $3,600. The CoinDesk 20 Index , which tracks a broad basket of crypto assets, gained 1.69% to 3,815.22. “Until BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume,” Enflux added, “the path of least resistance could remain sideways to down.” The market’s next move likely hinges on whether buyers are willing to step in and build a base within this low-volume zone, or whether another flush toward $110K is needed to reset the trend. For now, traders remain cautious, and the bulls remain unproven. Market Movers: BTC: A potential Bitcoin supply shock, driven by drying OTC desk reserves and steady corporate accumulation, could “uncork” BTC price action after a dip below $110K, market observers say. ETH: Ethereum may have formed a local top as sell pressure hits $419 million, its second-highest on record, while ETH retests a major resistance zone near $4,000 that preceded a 66% drop in late 2024, raising the risk of a 25–35% decline by September; meanwhile, Polymarket bettors remain split, with 48% backing a rally to $5,000 despite the bearish signals. Gold: Gold's rally stalled Wednesday as traders took profits and weighed rising Fed rate cut odds, U.S. trade tensions, and a looming Fed leadership shakeup, leaving prices flat after a three-day gain driven by economic weakness; spot gold last traded at $3,372.11, down 0.24% on the day. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 flat, as investors shrugged off new U.S. semiconductor tariff threats. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were flat Wednesday night as traders digested Trump’s new semiconductor tariffs, with the S&P 500 still up 1.7% for the week.

2025-08-07 01:30:15,49667039,1754530215,Solana Ships New Smartphone Worldwide — Is $500 Next for SOL?,"Solana is making headlines again – this time not just for its blazing-fast blockchain, but for its growing presence in consumer tech. The launch of its second-generation smartphone has captured the attention of both crypto investors and mobile tech enthusiasts. Meanwhile, early investors looking for the next big opportunity are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining serious traction during its early stage with massive upside projections. Seeker Smartphone: A Web3 Powerhouse in Your Pocket Solana Mobile has begun shipping its new crypto-focused smartphone, the Seeker, to over 50 countries worldwide. With more than 150,000 units pre-ordered, it’s already outpacing the original Saga phone, which sold just 20,000. Retailing at $450–$500, the Seeker is expected to bring in at least $67.5 million in revenue. But what truly sets the Seeker apart is its deep integration with blockchain tools. It includes a hardware-isolated Seed Vault for securely storing private keys and recovery phrases, along with a decentralized app store that bypasses Apple and Google’s restrictive frameworks. This opens up direct access to NFTs, DeFi, games, and dApps—all without the usual 30% commissions or app store bans. New Contender Could Outperform Even Solana’s Gains While Solana is generating buzz with real-world products, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads with numbers. With analysts forecasting up to 14,500% returns from its current stage, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year . As access tightens and allocations vanish, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage SHIB and DOGE—but with a more advanced ecosystem in development. For those entering before major exchange listings, the potential could be enormous. Is $500 SOL a Realistic Target? The buzz around the Seeker has added fresh fuel to Solana’s price outlook . Already showing strength amid altcoin rotation, SOL could ride the wave of mobile adoption to new highs. Analysts point to key ecosystem metrics—DeFi TVL, NFT activity, and user growth—as signs of continued strength. If momentum holds, a run to $500 is within reach, especially considering the anticipation of spot ETF approval. Conclusion The Seeker’s launch marks a major step forward for crypto-native mobile tech, and Solana is leading the charge. But while SOL’s climb to $500 is drawing speculation, some investors are placing their bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE for even bigger returns . With limited access remaining and bold ROI projections , this might be the altcoin to watch as the next bull run unfolds.

Priced at $0.035, the new DeFi project has caught the eye of traders. investors who get in on phase 6 presale of MUTM will experience a 71.43% return on investment as the project goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has now surpassed over $14.1 million and over 14,800 investors. Meanwhile, legacy tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to struggle with sideways momentum and lack of innovation, making way for utility-driven platforms like Mutuum to dominate headlines and investor interest. As capital rotates into more purpose-built DeFi ecosystems, the narrative this month belongs not to memecoins but to the rise of next-gen, use-case-backed assets like MUTM. Dogecoin (DOGE) Hovering Near $0.20 Amid Rotation Toward Utility-Driven Tokens Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.20, having pulled back roughly 4% in the past 24 hours and about 15% off its July peak of around $0.26–$0.27 as investor appetite shifts away from meme narratives. Despite whale accumulation, over 2 billion DOGE (~$400M) observed at $0.21 support levels, technical indicators like weakening RSI and flat volume suggest momentum is waning. Short-term resistance sits in the $0.23–$0.24 zone, while support levels around $0.20–$0.21 could determine DOGE’s next path. As capital begins rotating toward utility-driven DeFi platforms, emerging protocol narratives like Mutuum Finance are increasingly drawing investor focus. Mutuum Finance Launches Phase 6 of Token Presale Mutuum Finance has recently introduced Round 6 of its presale with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price increase will take the token up by another 14.29% to $0.04, so members will now be able to make 71.43% when it finally goes live at $0.06. The presale itself has already garnered over 14,800 investors and raised over $14.1 million, demonstrating the belief that the market has placed on the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Empowering Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance adopts a twin-model approach of facilitating flexibility and efficacy in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract makes use of autonomous smart contracts that carry out the lending independently without any participation of human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unpredictable rate of interest as guided by existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to be in direct interaction with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance Boosts Stability Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a stablecoin to be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be sound and secure investment product to remove risk and uncertainty that can be attributed to algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. That is a key milestone as much as Mutuum Finance’s goal is to become an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol. That also shows that the team is proud to be industry security standards-compliant. Mutuum Finance Deploys $50K Bug Bounty to Strengthen Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has initiated its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. There are four severity levels in the program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. All the probable bugs are hence found and rewarded. It is in line with the vision of the team to establish a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. As Dogecoin stalls near $0.20 with little to show in terms of innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum fast. The project has already raised over $14.1 million and attracted 14,800+ investors, signaling strong market confidence. Investors joining Phase 6 at $0.035 can lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06. With a dual-lending system, USD-pegged stablecoin in development, CertiK audit, and $50K bug bounty, MUTM is proving it’s more than hype, it’s built for long-term growth.

2025-08-07 01:25:10,49666821,1754529910,South Korea Stablecoin Regulation: A Pivotal Move Towards Global Clarity,"BitcoinWorld South Korea Stablecoin Regulation: A Pivotal Move Towards Global Clarity A significant development is unfolding in the world of digital finance, as South Korea stablecoin regulation takes a crucial step forward. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), operating under South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), has initiated a comprehensive study. This move highlights the nation’s commitment to creating a robust and secure environment for digital assets, particularly stablecoins, through proactive virtual asset legislation . Why is South Korea Stablecoin Regulation So Important? On August 6th, the FSC’s FIU commissioned a pivotal FSC stablecoin study . This initiative focuses on the second phase of virtual asset legislation and aims to establish clear anti-money laundering (AML) measures for stablecoins. This proactive approach is designed to integrate stablecoins into the existing financial framework, allowing their legitimate use for payments and cross-border transfers. The goal is to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. By bringing stablecoins under a regulatory umbrella, South Korea seeks to mitigate risks associated with illicit activities and market volatility. This is a critical step for the broader adoption of digital currencies and strengthens South Korea stablecoin regulation efforts. What Does This Stablecoin Legislation Entail? The upcoming stablecoin legislation is not just about compliance; it’s about defining the future role of these digital assets. The study will meticulously review global regulatory approaches to stablecoins. This means examining how other major economies are handling these assets, ensuring South Korea adopts best practices. Key aspects of the FSC stablecoin study include: Reviewing international AML standards for stablecoins. Examining combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) measures for digital assets. Assessing frameworks that permit stablecoins for everyday transactions and cross-border transfers. This comprehensive review aims to create a regulatory environment that is both secure and conducive to growth, shaping future stablecoin legislation . Paving the Way for Robust Virtual Asset Legislation This initiative extends beyond just stablecoins. It is an integral part of South Korea’s broader effort to develop comprehensive virtual asset legislation . The nation recognizes the evolving landscape of digital finance and the need for clear rules to govern all types of virtual assets. The FSC’s commitment to this study demonstrates a strategic vision. They aim to: Enhance market integrity within the digital asset space. Protect investors from potential scams and market manipulation. Position South Korea as a leader in responsible digital asset innovation and robust virtual asset legislation . Such legislation is vital for building trust in the digital economy and encouraging responsible growth. How Will Global Stablecoin Rules Influence Korea’s Approach? The focus on reviewing global stablecoin rules is a smart move. By understanding international precedents, South Korea can avoid common pitfalls and implement effective, harmonized regulations. This global perspective is essential for assets like stablecoins, which inherently operate across borders. The insights gained from analyzing various global stablecoin rules will inform South Korea’s own framework, potentially setting a benchmark for other nations contemplating similar regulatory frameworks. It highlights the importance of international cooperation in regulating the fast-paced crypto market effectively. In conclusion, South Korea’s proactive stance on South Korea stablecoin regulation , driven by the FSC’s comprehensive FSC stablecoin study , marks a significant milestone. This effort promises a more secure, transparent, and integrated future for digital assets within the nation’s financial system.

2025-08-06 15:10:11,49643861,1754493011,"Bitcoin Price Surge: Astounding Ascent Above $115,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Surge: Astounding Ascent Above $115,000 The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin (BTC) achieves an extraordinary milestone, experiencing a significant Bitcoin price surge that has propelled it past the staggering $115,000 mark. According to diligent market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $115,017.99 on the Binance USDT market. This remarkable ascent has captivated investors and analysts alike, sparking widespread discussion about the future trajectory of the leading digital asset. This pivotal moment underscores Bitcoin’s growing resilience and its continued dominance in the digital finance landscape. Investors are keenly watching to see if this momentum can be sustained, potentially setting the stage for further gains in the broader crypto market. What Propelled BTC Past $115,000 ? This latest surge isn’t just a random fluctuation; it signifies strong underlying momentum. Several key factors are likely contributing to this impressive BTC $115,000 breakthrough. Understanding these drivers helps us grasp the broader market dynamics at play. Increased Institutional Interest: More large financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, signaling growing confidence in its long-term value. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: Favorable economic conditions and a potential shift in monetary policies can make alternative assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Supply Dynamics: Events like the Bitcoin halving, which reduces the rate of new Bitcoin creation, inherently limit supply and can drive up demand. Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in the Bitcoin network and the wider crypto ecosystem enhance its utility and appeal. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin, pushing its price to new heights and reinforcing its position as a store of value. Understanding the Current Crypto Market Rally The recent price action for Bitcoin is part of a broader trend, often referred to as a crypto market rally . This indicates a general upward movement across various digital assets, not just BTC. Such rallies are typically fueled by renewed investor confidence and a bullish sentiment spreading throughout the ecosystem. A widespread rally suggests that capital is flowing back into the entire digital asset space, benefiting altcoins as well. This positive sentiment can create a self-reinforcing cycle, attracting even more investors. However, it is always prudent to remember that market rallies can experience corrections, so a balanced perspective is essential. Is This Bitcoin Breaking Records a Sustainable Trend? While the excitement around Bitcoin breaking records is palpable, a crucial question arises: is this growth sustainable? History shows that cryptocurrency markets can be volatile, characterized by rapid gains followed by significant pullbacks. Therefore, understanding both the potential and the risks is essential for any investor. Sustainability often depends on fundamental factors like adoption rates, regulatory clarity, and technological innovation. While the current momentum is strong, investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Diversification across different asset classes remains a key strategy for managing potential market fluctuations. Navigating Future Cryptocurrency Trends As we look ahead, the current momentum suggests a promising period for cryptocurrency trends . However, staying informed about market developments and adopting a strategic approach remains vital. The digital asset space is constantly evolving, presenting both exciting opportunities and potential challenges. Keep an eye on global economic indicators, regulatory announcements, and technological breakthroughs within the blockchain space. These factors can significantly influence market direction. Furthermore, understanding the difference between short-term volatility and long-term value propositions is crucial for navigating the crypto landscape successfully. Bitcoin’s impressive climb above $115,000 marks a significant moment in the cryptocurrency journey. It underscores the growing maturity and resilience of the digital asset space. While volatility is inherent, the long-term outlook remains compelling for those who approach the market with informed decisions and a clear strategy. This milestone not only celebrates Bitcoin’s strength but also highlights the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the digital economy.

2025-08-06 15:10:00,49644155,1754493000,Here Is Shiba Inu Price If It Becomes the Meme King of the Next Bull Run,"The prospect of Shiba Inu becoming the meme king of the next bull run could significantly impact the price of SHIB. With only a few months left before the end of the current cycle, investors are already focused on the next bull run, expected to occur in 2028/2029. Ahead of that bull run, development teams behind tokens like Shiba Inu are already preparing their projects to participate in the upcoming rally. In particular, the Shiba Inu team has introduced several utility projects, including Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and the automated burn mechanism ShibTorch, that could elevate SHIB’s price to greater heights. What It Entails for SHIB to be the Meme King Notably, Shiba Inu aims to become the king of the meme coin market and dominate other tokens in this sector. It achieved this feat in the 2020/2021 bull cycle, when it usurped Dogecoin several times while soaring to an all-time high of $0.00008845. However, Shiba Inu relinquished the title back to Dogecoin almost immediately. Despite this, speculation suggests that Shiba Inu could reclaim the meme king title in the next bull run. Achieving this feat implies that Shiba Inu would rank as the largest token by market cap in the meme coin market. At the moment, Shiba Inu is ranked as the second-biggest meme coin. It is valued at $8.3 billion, with a token currently trading at $0.00001208. For Shiba Inu to become the meme king, it must usurp Dogecoin, which currently leads that market with a valuation of $35.79 billion. SHIB Price If It Becomes Meme KingSurpassing Dogecoin’s market cap and becoming the meme king would require Shiba Inu’s valuation to grow roughly 382%. The rally will eventually push Shiba Inu’s market cap from $8.3 billion to $40 billion, surpassing DOGE’s current $35.7 billion. This analysis assumes Dogecoin’s market cap does not exceed $40 billion in the next bull run. Given Shiba Inu’s supply of 589.25 trillion tokens, a market cap of $40 billion translates to a price of $0.00006788 per token. The estimated target is still below Shiba Inu’s previous all-time high of $0.00008845, registered in October 2021. Is $0.00006788 Feasible for SHIB?Whether SHIB can become the meme king of the next cycle and ultimately climb to $0.00006788 remains to be seen. Most crypto analysts believe that $0.00006788 is a realistic target for Shiba Inu. In November, the marketing lead of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Lucie, showcased SHIB’s substantial lifetime gains against Bitcoin and USDT. The chart showed that Shiba Inu massively outperformed both Bitcoin and USDT, prompting Lucie to declare that SHIB was doing fine. Following Shiba Inu’s remarkable performance, Lucie predicted a subsequent surge to $0.00006861. However, she did not indicate when the prediction would materialize. In the absence of a specific timeline, we turned to Chagelly for an estimate regarding when SHIB will clinch the $0.00006788 target. According to Changelly, SHIB could trade at around $0.00006788 in the next cycle, precisely by July 2028. In that month, Changelly envisions SHIB reaching a maximum target of $0.0000684. Meanwhile, investors should not reference this analysis as financial advice due to the volatile nature of cryptos. Moreover, the possibility of SHIB becoming the meme king remains uncertain due to the absence of an ETF tied to the token and the team’s decision to stay anonymous.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,1,prospect shiba inu becoming meme king next bull run could significantly impact price shib month left end current cycle investor already focused next bull run expected occur ahead bull run development team behind token like shiba inu already preparing project participate upcoming rally particular shiba inu team introduced several utility project including shibarium shibaswap automated burn mechanism shibtorch could elevate shib price greater height entail shib meme king notably shiba inu aim become king meme coin market dominate token sector achieved feat bull cycle usurped dogecoin several time soaring high however shiba inu relinquished title back dogecoin almost immediately despite speculation suggests shiba inu could reclaim meme king title next bull run achieving feat implies shiba inu would rank largest token market cap meme coin market moment shiba inu ranked meme coin valued billion token currently trading shiba inu become meme king must usurp dogecoin currently lead market valuation billion shib price becomes meme kingsurpassing dogecoin market cap becoming meme king would require shiba inu valuation grow roughly rally eventually push shiba inu market cap billion billion surpassing doge current billion analysis assumes dogecoin market cap exceed billion next bull run given shiba inu supply trillion token market cap billion translates price per token estimated target still shiba inu previous high registered october feasible shib whether shib become meme king next cycle ultimately climb remains seen crypto analyst believe realistic target shiba inu november marketing lead shiba inu ecosystem lucie showcased shib substantial lifetime gain bitcoin usdt chart showed shiba inu massively outperformed bitcoin usdt prompting lucie declare shib fine following shiba inu remarkable performance lucie predicted subsequent surge however indicate prediction would materialize absence specific timeline turned chagelly estimate regarding shib clinch target according changelly shib could trade around next cycle precisely july month changelly envisions shib reaching maximum target meanwhile investor reference analysis financial advice due volatile nature cryptos moreover possibility shib becoming meme king remains uncertain due absence etf tied token team decision stay anonymous,0.011,0.898,0.091,0.9781,1
2025-08-06 15:08:28,49643715,1754492908,SBI Holdings Seeks Approval for Japan’s First Bitcoin and XRP ETFs,"SBI Holdings files to launch Japan’s first ETFs for Bitcoin, XRP, and “gold-crypto” mix. Crypto ETFs face pending approval; XRP spot ETFs currently trade only in Canada. Japan’s new rules may ease crypto ETF launches, lower investor tax burdens. Japanese financial group SBI Holdings has filed applications to launch two cryptocurrency ETFs, according to the company’s Q2 2025 earnings report . It involves two trusts, namely: The Digital Gold Crypto ETF: This ETF will allocate up to 51% of its assets to gold ETF shares and the remaining 49% to crypto ETFs. The company believes this approach provides investors with a balanced investment product. The Crypto-Assets ETF: This fund will invest directly in Bitcoin and XRP, providing a single entry point to what SBI Holdings considers the two most promising cryptocurrency sectors. Both ETF applications have been submitted to Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) and are awaiting a response. Among major global markets, an XRP spot ETF is currently only available in Canada. Experts believe that similar exchange-traded funds in the United States could be approved as early as Q4 2025, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. In June 2025, the FSA proposed classifying crypto assets as financial products—a move that, if adopted, would allow providers to launch crypto ETFs and reduce the tax burden for individual investors. SBI Holdings is an active proponent of this sector. The company recently partnered with Circle, issuer of USD Coin (USDC), and invested in the firm during its IPO. The report also notes SBI Holdings’ interest in stablecoins, specifically USDC and Ripple’s RLUSD, as well as plans to issue stablecoins pegged to the yen.

Whales bought over one billion Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/qdGrIE6Gez — Ali (@ali_charts) August 6, 2025 도지코인 가격이 고래들의 강력한 매수세에 힘입어 0.20달러 저항선을 돌파했다. 주간 차트에서 0.23달러 저항선을 상회하는 종가를 기록할 경우 대규모 상승장이 촉발될 것으로 전망된다. 한편 스마트 머니 투자자들이 도지코인 베타 코인에도 투자를 진행하고 있는 것으로 보인다. 대표적으로 맥시 도지 코인의 경우 ICO 시작 후 불과 며칠 만에 약 40만 달러의 투자금을 유치한 것으로 나타났다. 업계 전문가들은 이미 이를 주시하고 있으며, 다수가 맥시 도지를 100배 이상의 수익이 기대되는 차세대 암호화폐로 평가하고 있다. 고래들 , 10 억 도지코인 매수 행보 배경 관심 집중 전문가들 사이에서 도지코인이 현재 시장에서 가장 저평가된 대형 시가총액 암호화폐 자산 중 하나라는 강력한 의견이 형성된 것으로 보인다. 도지코인의 최근 움직임은 예상된 흐름으로 보인다. 도지코인은 상승장에서 후발 주자로 움직이는 경향을 보여왔다. 밈코인 시장의 선두주자인 도지코인은 7월 말 0.28달러까지 상승하며 돌파구를 마련했으나, 거시경제 전망 악화로 인한 전반적인 시장 하락세를 극복하지 못한 것으로 나타났다. 고래들이 이번에도 0.20달러 선에서 도지코인을 매수하는 기회를 놓치지 않고 있다. 이는 이번 상승장에서 도지코인이 1달러까지 상승할 수 있다는 전망에 따른 것으로 보인다. 암호화폐 시장의 강세장이 아직 끝나지 않은 것으로 분석가들은 전망하고 있다. 비트코인은 15만 달러까지, 이더리움은 1만 달러까지, XRP는 10달러까지 상승할 것으로 예측된다. 이에 따라 도지코인이 1달러에 도달할 것이란 전망도 더 이상 단순한 밈으로 치부되지 않는 상황이다. 블룸버그 애널리스트들이 현물 도지코인 ETF의 승인 가능성이 높은 것으로 분석했다. 이더리움이 주류 투자자들에게 비트코인의 열등한 버전으로 인식되는 것과 달리, 도지코인은 특히 온라인 커뮤니티에서 강력한 브랜드 영향력을 보유하고 있다. 이에 따라 현물 도지코인 ETF는 이더리움 ETF가 이더리움 가격에 미치는 영향보다 도지코인 가격에 더 큰 상승 동력이 될 것으로 전망된다. 도지코인 가격 전망 – 도지코인 전면 매수 시기 도래했나 ? 도지코인 가격이 0.20달러 지지선을 회복한 것으로 나타났다. 강세장 세력은 현재 주요 저항선인 0.24달러선 위로 주간 마감을 목표로 하고 있으며, 이는 급격한 상승을 촉발할 수 있을 것으로 전망된다. 특히 도지코인은 100일 단순이동평균선도 다시 회복한 상태다. 고래들이 지난 24시간 동안 10억 도지코인을 대거 매수한 것으로 관찰됨에 따라, 현물 매수자들의 도지코인 매수가 부담 없이 이뤄질 것으로 전망된다. 도지코인에서 레버리지 롱 포지션을 고려하는 투자자들은 0.23달러 지지/저항선 회복을 지켜볼 필요가 있다. 또한 이 밈코인의 이동평균수렴확산지수(MACD 12, 26) 골든크로스 신호도 주목할 만한 지표로 여겨진다. 도지코인의 MACD 지표가 지난주 하락세를 보이는 데스크로스를 형성했으나, 현재 이를 반전시킬 조짐을 보이고 있어 매우 강력한 상승 신호로 해석될 수 있는 상황이다. 전문가들 , 맥시 도지를 차세대 100 배 수익 가능 암호화폐로 지목 스마트 머니 투자자들이 도지코인 베타 코인에 투자하는 움직임이 나타나고 있다. 도지코인 가격이 상승할 때마다 도지코인 테마의 밈코인들도 함께 상승하는 경향을 보이기 때문이다. 이러한 밈코인들은 상대적으로 시가총액이 작아 때로는 도지코인보다 더 높은 수익률을 기록하고 있다. 맥시 도지(MAXI) 의 경우, 바이럴한 ICO를 통해 출시 초기 며칠 만에 약 40만 달러의 자금을 모금했다. 맥시 도지는 기존 도지코인의 더욱 과감하고 진화된 변형으로, 온라인 암호화폐 투기 문화를 풍자적으로 표현한 코인이다. 찢어진 마스코트부터 끝없이 공급되는 에너지 드링크, 1000배 거래에 대한 집착에 이르기까지, 이 프로젝트는 밈코인 트레이더들의 혼돈스러운 에너지를 반영하고 있다. 공감할 수 있으면서도 터무니없고, 무엇보다 재미있게 구성된 것이 특징적인 요소로 평가된다. 시장 분석가들이 지적한 바와 같이, 사람들의 웃음을 자아내는 밈 코인들이 결국 시장에서 가장 큰 이변을 보여주는 경향이 있는 것으로 나타났다. 맥시도지는 표면적인 밈코인을 넘어서 커뮤니티 중심의 토큰노믹스, 매력적인 스테이킹 보상, 감사를 완료한 스마트 계약을 통해 기본적으로 견고한 저가 밈코인의 면모를 보여주고 있다. 다음은 암호화폐 전문가 및 유튜버 코인랩이 소개한 맥시 도지 프리세일 코인이다. 전문가들은 예상대로 맥시 도지의 상승 잠재력에 대해 낙관적인 견해를 보이고 있으며, 다수가 이를 100배 이상의 수익을 낼 수 있는 차세대 암호화폐로 전망하고 있다. 맥시 도지 프리세일 참여하기",Altcoin News,EN,1,시장 전반의 불확실성 속에서도 도지코인이 폭발적인 상승세를 준비하는 모습을 보이고 있다 저명한 암호화폐 분석가 알리 마르티네즈가 고래들이 만에 약 달러 규모의 도지코인 매수한 것으로 밝혀졌다고 전했다 whale bought one billion dogecoin doge last hour ali august 도지코인 가격이 고래들의 강력한 매수세에 힘입어 저항선을 돌파했다 주간 차트에서 저항선을 상회하는 종가를 기록할 경우 대규모 상승장이 촉발될 것으로 전망된다 한편 스마트 머니 투자자들이 도지코인 베타 코인에도 투자를 진행하고 있는 것으로 보인다 대표적으로 맥시 도지 코인의 경우 ico 시작 후 불과 며칠 만에 약 달러의 투자금을 유치한 것으로 나타났다 업계 전문가들은 이미 이를 주시하고 있으며 다수가 맥시 도지를 이상의 수익이 기대되는 차세대 암호화폐로 평가하고 있다 고래들 억 도지코인 매수 행보 배경 관심 집중 전문가들 사이에서 도지코인이 현재 시장에서 가장 저평가된 대형 시가총액 암호화폐 자산 중 하나라는 강력한 의견이 형성된 것으로 보인다 도지코인의 최근 움직임은 예상된 흐름으로 보인다 도지코인은 상승장에서 후발 주자로 움직이는 경향을 보여왔다 밈코인 시장의 선두주자인 도지코인은 말 상승하며 돌파구를 마련했으나 거시경제 전망 악화로 인한 전반적인 시장 하락세를 극복하지 못한 것으로 나타났다 고래들이 이번에도 선에서 도지코인을 매수하는 기회를 놓치지 않고 있다 이는 이번 상승장에서 도지코인이 상승할 수 있다는 전망에 따른 것으로 보인다 암호화폐 시장의 강세장이 아직 끝나지 않은 것으로 분석가들은 전망하고 있다 비트코인은 달러까지 이더리움은 달러까지 xrp는 상승할 것으로 예측된다 이에 따라 도지코인이 도달할 것이란 전망도 더 이상 단순한 밈으로 치부되지 않는 상황이다 블룸버그 애널리스트들이 현물 도지코인 etf의 승인 가능성이 높은 것으로 분석했다 이더리움이 주류 투자자들에게 비트코인의 열등한 버전으로 인식되는 것과 달리 도지코인은 특히 온라인 커뮤니티에서 강력한 브랜드 영향력을 보유하고 있다 이에 따라 현물 도지코인 etf는 이더리움 etf가 이더리움 가격에 미치는 영향보다 도지코인 가격에 더 큰 상승 동력이 될 것으로 전망된다 도지코인 가격 전망 도지코인 전면 매수 시기 도래했나 도지코인 가격이 지지선을 회복한 것으로 나타났다 강세장 세력은 현재 주요 저항선인 위로 주간 마감을 목표로 하고 있으며 이는 급격한 상승을 촉발할 수 있을 것으로 전망된다 특히 도지코인은 단순이동평균선도 다시 회복한 상태다 고래들이 지난 동안 도지코인을 대거 매수한 것으로 관찰됨에 따라 현물 매수자들의 도지코인 매수가 부담 없이 이뤄질 것으로 전망된다 도지코인에서 레버리지 롱 포지션을 고려하는 투자자들은 회복을 지켜볼 필요가 있다 또한 이 밈코인의 이동평균수렴확산지수 macd 골든크로스 신호도 주목할 만한 지표로 여겨진다 도지코인의 macd 지표가 지난주 하락세를 보이는 데스크로스를 형성했으나 현재 이를 반전시킬 조짐을 보이고 있어 매우 강력한 상승 신호로 해석될 수 있는 상황이다 전문가들 맥시 도지를 차세대 배 수익 가능 암호화폐로 지목 스마트 머니 투자자들이 도지코인 베타 코인에 투자하는 움직임이 나타나고 있다 도지코인 가격이 상승할 때마다 도지코인 테마의 밈코인들도 함께 상승하는 경향을 보이기 때문이다 이러한 밈코인들은 상대적으로 시가총액이 작아 때로는 도지코인보다 더 높은 수익률을 기록하고 있다 맥시 도지 maxi 의 경우 바이럴한 ico를 통해 출시 초기 며칠 만에 약 달러의 자금을 모금했다 맥시 도지는 기존 도지코인의 더욱 과감하고 진화된 변형으로 온라인 암호화폐 투기 문화를 풍자적으로 표현한 코인이다 찢어진 마스코트부터 끝없이 공급되는 에너지 드링크 거래에 대한 집착에 이르기까지 이 프로젝트는 밈코인 트레이더들의 혼돈스러운 에너지를 반영하고 있다 공감할 수 있으면서도 터무니없고 무엇보다 재미있게 구성된 것이 특징적인 요소로 평가된다 시장 분석가들이 지적한 바와 같이 사람들의 웃음을 자아내는 밈 코인들이 결국 시장에서 가장 큰 이변을 보여주는 경향이 있는 것으로 나타났다 맥시도지는 표면적인 밈코인을 넘어서 커뮤니티 중심의 토큰노믹스 매력적인 스테이킹 보상 감사를 완료한 스마트 계약을 통해 기본적으로 견고한 저가 밈코인의 면모를 보여주고 있다 다음은 암호화폐 전문가 및 유튜버 코인랩이 소개한 맥시 도지 프리세일 코인이다 전문가들은 예상대로 맥시 도지의 상승 잠재력에 대해 낙관적인 견해를 보이고 있으며 다수가 이를 이상의 수익을 낼 수 있는 차세대 암호화폐로 전망하고 있다 맥시 도지 프리세일 참여하기,0.0,0.996,0.004,0.25,1

2025-08-06 15:05:17,49643617,1754492717,Analyst Reveals XRP Final Line of Defense,"A prominent analyst known as Cryptoes has identified a key technical level that could define XRP’s next major move: $2.94. According to his latest post on X, XRP must hold this level to prevent a deeper correction , making it the “final line of defense” for the bulls. $2.94: A Decisive Battleground The $2.94 price point isn’t just psychological, it’s also technically significant. The uploaded chart highlights this zone as a former resistance level that XRP recently flipped into support during its explosive breakout. Now, with the token pulling back from highs above $3.60, XRP is once again testing this crucial zone. As of report time, XRP is trading around $2.93–$2.94, hovering at the edge of this support. A failure to hold could open the door for a stronger sell-off, potentially dragging the price back toward the $2.73 and $2.61 support levels, as identified by multiple analysts. The #XRP Final line of defense Price needs to hold above $2.94 Updates coming pic.twitter.com/iHpR7GkV5F — Cryptoes (@cryptoes_ta) August 5, 2025 Price Structure and Market Context XRP’s recent breakout from a multi-month descending triangle pattern was a textbook bullish move. The rally was sharp, pushing prices beyond major resistance levels and triggering renewed optimism across the market. However, like many assets after a parabolic run, XRP is now experiencing a healthy correction. The $2.94 zone is where this correction must find footing. Technical indicators such as the Parabolic SAR, shown in the chart, suggest momentum is weakening. Yet XRP remains above key moving averages on the higher timeframes, which still gives bulls a reason to stay engaged, if this level holds. Why $2.94 Matters More Than Ever This specific price level also serves as a liquidity pivot. During the early-year rally, $2.94 acted as a ceiling that XRP failed to break multiple times. It was only after the Bulls convincingly reclaimed it that the market exploded to the upside. If XRP now loses that same level, the breakout risks becoming a bull trap, a pattern where price fails to sustain gains and reverses sharply. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Traders view such zones as make-or-break . Holding above $2.94 would allow XRP to stabilize, consolidate, and possibly retest upper resistance zones between $3.05 and $3.10. Reclaiming those would reopen the path to $3.25 and potentially beyond. The Road Ahead XRP remains at a technical crossroads . The broader sentiment in the market is cautious, with traders waiting to see whether this correction is temporary or the beginning of a longer consolidation phase. Trading volumes have declined slightly, and momentum indicators are mixed, reflecting the uncertainty. For now, all eyes are on $2.94. If the bulls defend it successfully, the structure remains bullish, and the uptrend could soon resume. But if that support fails, the market could see a more pronounced downturn. As Cryptoes pointed out, this is XRP’s final line of defense, one that may define whether the next leg is up or down.

2025-08-06 15:03:36,49644173,1754492616,The Layer 1 Fallacy: Chasing Premium Without Substance,"In financial markets, startups have long sought to market themselves as ""tech firms"" hoping investors will value them with tech-company multiples. And often, they do — at least for a while. Traditional institutions learned this the hard way. Throughout the 2010s, many corporations scrambled to reposition themselves as technology companies. Banks, payment processors and retailers began calling themselves fintechs or data businesses. But few earned the valuation multiples of true tech firms — because the fundamentals rarely matched the narrative. WeWork was among the most infamous examples: a real estate company dressed up as a tech platform that eventually collapsed under the weight of its own illusion. In financial services, Goldman Sachs launched Marcus in 2016 as a digital-first platform to rival consumer fintechs. Despite early traction, the initiative was scaled back in 2023 after persistent profitability issues. JPMorgan famously declared itself “a technology company with a banking license,” while BBVA and Wells Fargo invested heavily in digital transformation. Yet few of these efforts produced platform-level economics. Today, there’s a graveyard of such corporate tech delusions — a clear reminder that no amount of branding can override the structural constraints of capital-intensive or regulated business models. Crypto is now confronting a similar identity crisis. DeFi protocols want to be valued like Layer 1s. Real-world asset (RWA) dApps are presenting themselves as sovereign networks. Everyone is chasing the Layer 1 “technology premium.” And to be fair — that premium is real. Layer 1 networks like Ethereum, Solana and BNB consistently command higher valuation multiples, relative to metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) and fee generation. They benefit from a broader market narrative — one that rewards infrastructure over applications, and platforms over products. This premium holds even when controlling for fundamentals. Many DeFi protocols demonstrate strong TVL or fee generation, yet still struggle to achieve comparable market capitalizations. In contrast, Layer 1s attract early users through validator incentives and native token economics, then expand into developer ecosystems and composable applications. Ultimately, this premium reflects Layer 1s’ capacity for broad native token utility, ecosystem coordination and long-term extensibility. Furthermore, as fee volume grows, these networks often see disproportionate increases in market capitalization — a sign that investors are pricing in not just current usage, but future potential and compounding network effects. This layered flywheel, moving from infrastructure adoption to ecosystem growth, helps explain why Layer 1s consistently command higher valuations than dApps, even when underlying performance metrics appear similar. This mirrors how equity markets distinguish platforms from products. Infrastructure companies like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Apple’s App Store or Meta’s developer ecosystem are more than service providers — they are ecosystems. They enable thousands of developers and businesses to build, scale and interact. Investors assign higher multiples not just for present revenues, but for the potential to support emergent use cases, network effects and economies of scale. By contrast, even highly profitable SaaS tools or niche services rarely attract the same valuation premium — their growth is constrained by limited API composability and narrow utility. The same pattern is now playing out among large language model (LLM) providers. Most are racing to position themselves not as chatbots, but as foundational infrastructure for AI applications. Everyone wants to be AWS — not Mailchimp. Layer 1s in crypto follow a similar logic. They’re not just blockchains; they’re coordination layers for decentralized computation and state synchronization. They support a wide range of composable applications and assets. Their native tokens accrue value through base-layer activity: gas fees, staking, MEV and more. Crucially, these tokens also serve as mechanisms to incentivize developers and users. Layer 1s benefit from self-reinforcing loops — between users, builders, liquidity and token demand — and they support both vertical and horizontal scaling across sectors. Read the full article here. Most protocols, by contrast, are not infrastructure. They are single-purpose products. So adding a validator set doesn’t make them Layer 1s — it simply dresses up a product in infrastructure optics to justify a higher valuation. This is where the appchain trend enters the picture. Appchains combine application, protocol logic and a settlement layer into a vertically integrated stack. They promise better fee capture, user experience and “sovereignty.” In a few cases — like Hyperliquid — they deliver. By controlling the full stack, Hyperliquid has achieved rapid execution, excellent UX and meaningful fee generation — all without relying on token incentives. Developers can even deploy dApps on its underlying Layer 1, leveraging its high-performance decentralized exchange infrastructure. While its scope remains narrow, it offers a glimpse of some level of broader scaling potential. But most appchains are simply protocols trying to rebrand, with little usage and no ecosystem depth. They’re fighting a two-front war: trying to build both infrastructure and a product simultaneously, often without the capital or team to do either well. The result is a blurry hybrid — not quite a performant Layer 1, and not a category-defining dApp. We’ve seen this before. A robo-advisor with a slick UI was still a wealth manager. A bank with open APIs was still a balance-sheet business. A coworking company with a polished app was still just renting office space. Eventually, the hype wears off — and the market reprices accordingly. RWA protocols are now falling into the same trap. Many are positioning themselves as infrastructure for tokenized finance — but without meaningful differentiation from existing Layer 1s, or sustainable user adoption. At best, they are vertically integrated products with no compelling need for a sovereign settlement layer. Worse, most haven’t achieved product-market fit in their core use case. They bolt on infrastructure and lean into inflated narratives, hoping to justify valuations their economics can’t support. So what’s the path forward? The answer isn’t to fake infrastructure status. It’s to own your role as a product or service — and execute it exceptionally well. If your protocol solves a real problem and drives meaningful TVL growth, that’s a strong foundation. But TVL alone won’t make you a successful appchain. What matters most is real economic activity: TVL that drives sustainable fee generation, user retention and clear value accrual to the native token. In addition, if developers build on your protocol because it’s genuinely useful — not because it claims to be infrastructure — the market will reward you. Platform status is earned, not claimed. Some DeFi protocols — like Maker/Sky and Uniswap — are following this path. They’re evolving toward appchain-style models that improve scalability and cross-network access. But they’re doing so from a position of strength: with established ecosystems, clear monetization and product-market fit. In contrast, the emerging RWA space has yet to demonstrate durable traction. Nearly every RWA protocol or centralized service is rushing to launch an appchain — often backed by fragile or untested economics. As with leading DeFi protocols transitioning towards an appchain model, the best path forward for RWA protocols is to first leverage existing Layer 1 ecosystems, build user and developer traction that leads to TVL growth, demonstrate sustainable fee generation and only then evolve toward an appchain infrastructure model — with a clear purpose and strategy. Therefore, in the case of an appchain, the utility and economics of the underlying application must come first. Only once these are proven does a transition to a sovereign Layer 1 become viable. This stands in contrast to the growth trajectory of general-purpose Layer 1s, which can initially prioritize building a validator and trader ecosystem. Early fee generation is driven by native token transactions, and over time, cross market scaling broadens the network to include developers and end users — ultimately driving TVL growth and diversified fee streams. As crypto matures, the fog of storytelling is lifting, and investors are becoming more discerning. Buzzwords like “appchain” and “Layer 1” no longer command attention on their own. Without a clear value proposition, sustainable token economics and a well-defined strategic trajectory, protocols lack the foundational elements required for any credible transition to true infrastructure. What crypto needs — especially in the RWA sector — isn’t more Layer 1s. It needs better products. And the market will reward those who focus on building exactly that. Figure 1.

2025-08-06 15:02:09,49643439,1754492529,Bitcoin Options Data Shows Investors Positioning Against a Drop! Here Are the Critical Price Levels,"Following the strong rise in the cryptocurrency market last month, prices have calmed down, and investors have begun to take positions against the decline. Options Data Shows Investors Hedging Against Bitcoin Drops Below $100,000 and Ethereum Below $3,000 According to data from options platform Derive.xyz, there has been a notable increase in the number of put options opened for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in futures trading on August 29. This suggests that investors are hedging their bets, anticipating a decline by the end of the month. According to a market update shared by Dr. Sean Dawson, Derive’s Head of Research, put positions are almost five times larger than call positions in BTC options due August 29. These positions, particularly concentrated around the $95,000, $80,000, and $100,000 levels, reveal that investors are seriously anticipating that Bitcoin will fall below $100,000 again. On the Ethereum front, put options are 10% more expensive than call options. The most popular levels are $3,200, $3,000, and $2,200. Dawson notes that this trend is consistent with expectations ranging from a moderate correction to a deeper pullback. As of August 6, Ethereum was trading around $3,624, down more than 4% in the past week. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is trading at around $114,075, down 3% in the same period. Decline in Option Slope, Increase in Volatility According to Derive, the option “skew,” an indicator that measures how much downside protection investors demand, has fallen from +2 to -2 for Bitcoin and from +6 to -2 for Ethereum in the past month, suggesting a growing need for downside protection. BTC's monthly implied volatility is currently hovering around 35%, while ETH's has reportedly reached 65%. Since the beginning of June, the volatility gap between the two assets has widened from 24 points to 30 points, suggesting a more volatile future for Ethereum. Although investors are hedging their bets against the downside, Derive's probability estimates paint a mixed picture. The platform estimates a 25% chance of Ethereum falling below $3,000 by the end of August and a 30% chance of it breaking above $4,000 (up from 15% last week). Meanwhile, Bitcoin has an 18% chance of testing $100,000 again by the end of the month. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-06 15:01:19,49647922,1754492479,"Dogecoin Price Prediction 2026: Can Unilabs Finance, the New “Solana Slayer,” Steal the Spotlight?","The Dogecoin price prediction for August may have attracted a high-volume investment from memecoin whales, but Unilabs Finance is shifting the trend with its modern-gen technology. This AI asset manager with over $32 million in assets under management is topping charts, while savvy investors call it the new ‘Solana slayer’ after landing explosive gains while still in presale. Dogecoin Price Prediction for August Indicates Bullish Sentiment Dogecoin (DOGE) price has bounced back from its recent highs as the memecoin tests a critical support level. Analysts say the current Dogecoin price prediction shows that the altcoin reached nearly $0.28 on July 21, a five-month peak, before dipping to 30% in current levels. This selloff has pushed Dogecoin below both the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages. Source: TradingView Dogecoin now trades near $0.206 and $0.207, respectively, key technical levels that traders are watching closely. Based on this data, the upcoming Dogecoin price prediction shows that certain macroeconomic factors also contributed to the recent weakness. Also, President Trump introduced new import taxes ranging from 10% to 41% on goods from foreign countries. Dogecoin Momentum Indicators Show Mixed Signals Technical momentum indicators present a mixed picture for the upcoming Dogecoin price prediction. The daily Relative Strength Index has fallen from overbought readings above 80 to below 50, entering bearish territory. This decline signals that market momentum has cooled down, potentially leading to a recovery phase for those observing the Dogecoin price prediction. Source: TradingView The moving average convergence divergence indicator recently flipped bearish, confirming the recent rally has lost steam. However, in the recent Dogecoin price prediction, analysts point to potential bullish developments on shorter timeframes. The 4-hour RSI is approaching oversold levels below 30, a condition that previously triggered strong recoveries.

Its current presale price of $0.0016 is available only until August 11, with a significant price jump set to follow. The platform has launched a live 10 BTC auction to reward bigger buyers, injecting real urgency into the mix. DOGE’s latest volume spike didn’t push through resistance, and PEPE’s recovery has been modest. Both are facing fatigue, while BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention for building real tools, securing exchange listings, and raising over $363 million. Dogecoin Sees Big Trades But No Breakout Yet Dogecoin experienced multiple trading surges on July 28, with hourly volume exceeding 700 million coins. However, the price stayed pinned between $0.241 and $0.244, showing no real breakout despite the activity. Many thought these spikes hinted at upward momentum. But every push ran into heavy selling, leaving DOGE stuck. It ended the day at $0.239, almost flat from earlier sessions. Support near $0.238 is still strong and has held several times. That shows buyers are present. However, analysts say that unless DOGE pushes past $0.244 with solid volume, the upside remains capped. As it stands, DOGE looks like a coin to monitor; not chase. Meanwhile, newer platforms offering strong fundamentals are capturing real attention. PEPE Finds Demand at $0.000011, but Can It Build From Here? PEPE has found reliable support at $0.000011 after falling from $0.000014. This zone has proven strong, with data showing over 80 trillion PEPE tokens were bought between $0.000011 and $0.000012. That indicates solid buyer interest. Sentiment is turning. On July 26, funding rates turned positive for the first time in weeks. That typically hints at a shift toward bullish expectations. Technical signs are also improving. The RSI has risen above neutral on both daily and weekly charts, and MACD indicators show a bullish crossover. Still, caution remains. PEPE must close above $0.000014 with strong volume for any rally to gain traction. If that happens, analysts believe a move toward $0.000016 is possible. But the bigger question is whether the broader market will support it. Without that confirmation, any surge could be short-lived. BlockDAG: 10 BTC Auction, $0.0016 Price & $363M Presale Push Platform Toward $600M While meme coins are still trying to recover, BlockDAG is pushing forward with serious momentum. Now in Batch 29 of its presale, the platform offers BDAG at $0.0016 until August 11. This is a 17x markdown from the $0.0276 batch rate and 3,025% lower than the official launch price of $0.05. So far, BlockDAG has raised over $363 million and sold 24.7 billion coins. The next target is $600 million. A 10 BTC auction is currently live, where buyers are automatically entered based on their purchase size, making bigger contributors eligible for higher BTC rewards. BlockDAG isn’t just about talk, it’s already building. The X1 mining app has over 2 million users, the updated Dashboard V4 is live, and five exchanges are confirmed. A 100 million coin airdrop is in progress, supporting early adoption. From a tech angle, BlockDAG’s DAG-chain structure ensures scalability. It also includes EVM support and a low-code smart contract builder, aimed at developers and businesses alike. Sports partnerships with Seattle’s rugby and cricket teams boost mainstream adoption, and the platform is actively growing into a fully working Web3 network. DOGE and PEPE Stall While BlockDAG Gains Speed DOGE and PEPE are not without their strengths, but current performance tells a clear story. Dogecoin’s volume spikes lack follow-through, and PEPE is steady yet hesitant. Both face a slow climb with no guarantees. BlockDAG, by contrast, is creating urgency and utility. With a $0.0016 entry open for a few more days and a 10 BTC auction rewarding top participants, it’s capturing both capital and attention. Its $363 million raise is not only a headline but also funding real progress. In a market full of speculation, BlockDAG shows what it means to execute. The tools are live, the ecosystem is growing, and new users are joining daily. For anyone still waiting, now might be the last chance to grab in at the lowest price.

2025-08-06 15:00:52,49643421,1754492452,Bitcoin On Indonesia’s Radar As Possible Reserve Asset—Details,"Indonesia’s Vice President’s office recently invited Bitcoin advocates to discuss whether adding crypto to the nation’s reserves could make sense. It was a session full of big ideas about money. According to Bitcoin Indonesia on X, the talks looked at using BTC mining as part of a reserve mechanism. No policy has been set yet, but officials showed real interest in learning more. Exploring Bitcoin As A Reserve Asset Based on reports , the discussion centered on whether crypto could help Indonesia diversify its nearly $153 billion foreign reserves, up slightly from $152 billion in May 2025. The country traditionally holds gold, US dollars and government bonds. Introducing the crypto asset would be a major shift. Bitcoin Indonesia shared resources like The Bitcoin Standard and Ray Dalio’s The Changing World Order to back up their points. They even tied Michael Saylor’s price forecast for 2045 to the 100th anniversary of Indonesia’s independence, which seemed to resonate with officials. BIG NEWS: Indonesia is exploring Bitcoin as a national reserve. We were invited to the Vice President’s office to present how Bitcoin could benefit the country. What we discussed could shape the future of Indonesia’s economic strategy. pic.twitter.com/QGKgGRRgEU — Bitcoin Indonesia (@bitcoinindo21) August 5, 2025 Talking Education And Outreach Reports have disclosed that advocates want to build a bottom-up push—starting with schools, universities and local communities—to make sure people understand both the promise and the risks of digital assets. Indonesia just raised crypto transaction taxes on August 1 2025. Domestic trades now carry a 0.21% levy and overseas trades face 1%. VAT on purchases was removed, but mining faces a higher 2.2% VAT. From 2026, mining income will fall under regular income or corporate tax. In 2024, over 650 trillion rupiah changed hands in crypto trades. Those figures show why regulators feel the need to tighten rules even as they explore new ideas. Indonesia is waking up to Bitcoin. Adhit from the VP office says „Indonesia must also continue to educate about Bitcoin in the future.“ — Bitcoin Indonesia (@bitcoinindo21) August 5, 2025 Comparisons With Other Nations Other countries have made bold moves. El Salvador added BTC as legal tender in 2021 and now holds 6,067 BTC. Bhutan has mined 11,711 BTC—approximately $1.3 billion—in secret since 2020, with crypto accounting for as much as 40% of its GDP. Kazakhstan is considering crypto investments in ETFs or blockchain companies to diversify state funds. And in the US, President Donald Trump’s administration established a Strategic BTC Reserve with 198,109 BTC (approximately $17.5 billion), describing the crypto as “digital gold.” What’s Next For Jakarta? For Indonesia, the road ahead is open. Policymakers will have to balance BTC’s price fluctuations and energy consumption against possible benefits. Other plans could include pilot mining initiatives, public-private collaborations or formal white papers on digital-asset policy. Meanwhile, reports have disclosed that the next round of discussions may involve Bank Indonesia to assess market impacts and legal frameworks for the country’s planned crypto stockpile.

2025-08-06 15:00:51,49643434,1754492451,Satsuma Technology Raises £163.6M to Take Bitcoin Position,"UK-based decentralized AI and Bitcoin treasury firm, Satsuma Technology, has raised £163.6 million, worth $217.6 million, through a secured convertible note round. The fundraising effort was led by ParaFi Capital and backed by several major crypto and institutional investors. This event has become one of the largest of its kind in the UK. This marks a significant development in the country’s digital asset sector, combining artificial intelligence (AI) with Bitcoin-based capital strategy. Fundraising Exceeds Expectations, Attracts Strong Backing Satsuma’s secured convertible note round began on June 24 and ended on July 28. It brought in support from both global crypto funds and London-based institutional equity investors. The investors include Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group (DCG), Kraken, Arrington Capital, BTC Opportunity Fund, and Borderless Capital. In total, the raise brought in £163.6 million, far surpassing the original goal of £100 million. The loan notes will be converted into ordinary shares for £0.01 each. However, this will only happen after shareholders approve the plan and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approves the prospectus. A general meeting will be scheduled soon in this regard. Satsuma said that the most notable aspect of this round was that many investors chose to subscribe using Bitcoin . In total, the company accepted 1,097.29 BTC, worth £96.9 million, instead of cash. This marks the first-ever Bitcoin-based subscription of this kind in London. Satsuma plans to use the funds to expand its operations, retain at least three months’ working capital in cash. Also, it plans to strengthen its Bitcoin reserves through its Singapore subsidiary, Satsuma Pte. Rising Interest in UK Bitcoin Treasuries While U.S.-based companies still lead in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the UK is catching up. Satsuma previously bought 28.56 BTC in July after raising £5 million in seed funding in June. While Satsuma plans to allocate up to two-thirds of its reserves to Bitcoin, it is not the leading Bitcoin holder. That title goes to Smarter Web Company, which holds 2,050 BTC, worth $235 million . The Aquis exchange-listed firm also raised $21 million in a Bitcoin-denominated bond round this week. Other UK-based public firms like Phoenix Digital Assets, Coinsilium, and CoinShares also hold notable Bitcoin reserves. Market Response and Stock Movement Last month, some investors raised concerns over UTXO Management’s support for both The Smarter Web Company and Satsuma. Some viewed this as a conflict, believing UTXO should back only one Bitcoin treasury firm per region. Despite the online debate, Satsuma’s fundraising success suggests investor confidence remains high. Despite the fundraising success, Satsuma’s stock (SATS) dropped over 25% in early trading following the announcement. The share price is currently around £3.70, reflecting a fall of more than 50% since the company introduced its Bitcoin treasury policy in June.

Both moves follow a familiar path rooted in regional targeting and regulatory strategy, built to serve traditional user bases with limited flexibility. But Spartans is moving in a different direction. It offers open access, real-time crypto withdrawals, and a 300% bonus that is available to every user without exclusions or complicated terms. Whether it is sportsbook betting or crypto slots, the process is fast, direct, and built around utility. In a space filled with marketing noise, Spartans is not trying to follow industry trends. It is creating new ones and pulling ahead. 888 Casino’s Dutch Relaunch Faces Familiar Constraints 888 Casino is making its return to the Dutch market through a partnership with ComeOn Group. Now operating as 888.nl, the localized site offers sportsbook betting, live dealer games, and traditional casino options. This follows a four-year exit after regulatory shifts under the Remote Gambling Act pushed 888 out in 2021. The new strategy under Evoke PLC aims to minimize risk and expand through trusted partners. While it is a smart move for compliance, the platform remains confined by local rules and payment barriers. In contrast, platforms like Spartans offer global access with fewer limits and faster functionality. Betano’s Super Cup Spotlight Highlights Its Reach but Not Its Flexibility Betano has secured naming rights for the 2025 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, now rebranded with Betano at the forefront. Backed by the Portuguese Football Federation, this move places the sportsbook brand firmly in the spotlight during one of Portugal’s biggest football events. The sponsorship boosts visibility, but limitations still exist. Betano remains rooted in regional licensing and fiat transactions. For users who expect real-time crypto access and seamless global usability, platforms like Spartans continue to offer a more flexible and modern alternative. Visibility is important, but access remains king. Spartans Unlocks the Full Betting Experience With Zero Delays Spartans is not here to complicate the online betting process. It is here to strip it down to what matters. Speed, access, and real rewards are all built into the core of the platform. From the moment a user signs up, every feature is designed to be used immediately and without limitations. The 300% welcome bonus is open to everyone. No geo-locks, no hidden barriers. The terms are simple and clearly displayed. Players get a 35x wagering requirement, seven-day validity, and clearly capped withdrawals. It is not a bait offer. It is a real chance to play with value from the start. Crypto withdrawals are processed instantly through BTC, ETH, or USDT. Spartans skips the bank lines and third-party bottlenecks entirely. Whether the payout is small or substantial, the platform delivers it fast and directly to your wallet. There is no red tape or unnecessary wait time. With 5,963 games from 43 providers and a mobile-optimized interface, Spartans covers slots, blackjack, crash games, and live sports betting without needing an app. Users can enter any game or sportsbook market directly from their browser. This is what a true crypto-native platform looks like. While others chase sponsorships, Spartans is building something that works on day one. Key Insights Spartans is not chasing attention through sponsorships or regional branding. It is building a platform that works everywhere, for everyone. While 888 Casino prepares its return and Betano courts football fans, Spartans is gaining real ground by focusing on what players need. With 5,963 games, a sportsbook made for fast decisions, and instant crypto withdrawals, Spartans delivers value without friction. The 300% bonus is usable, the access is global, and the experience is built for crypto-first players. In 2025, the platform winning the race is not the loudest one. It is the one that works best.

2025-08-06 15:00:21,49643472,1754492421,"Best Long-Term Cryptos For 2025: Why BlockDAG Could Leave LINK, SHIB & Mantle Behind","When it comes to spotting the best long-term cryptos for 2025, the goal isn’t chasing noise, it’s securing projects with actual use cases, clear vision, and growth potential. Some projects offer hands-on tools before listings, others are building key infrastructure, and a few turn meme energy into serious upside. This shortlist features four top coins for the year ahead. With BlockDAG’s live presale tools, Chainlink’s crucial oracle network, Mantle’s treasury-backed scaling, and Shiba Inu’s growing ecosystem, each of these cryptos offers a compelling angle that buyers can’t afford to overlook. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Real-Time Trading Dashboard Puts This Presale in a League of Its Own BlockDAG is winning early, and loudly, by giving users a live trading experience before its token is even listed. With the special “TRADEBDAG” code, anyone can dive into its full-featured dashboard, which includes active BUY and SELL panels, BDAG/USD price charts, and a live order book. It’s not a demo. It’s synced to the presale and shows actual wallet balances as they change. This isn’t just a teaser. BlockDAG is showing its cards now, while others are still hiding behind vague promises. That’s exactly the kind of transparency that long-term investors want, especially from a project that’s already done more than $363 million in sales and moved 24.7 billion coins. Now, here’s the kicker, while the current batch 29 price is $0.0276, a short-lived $0.0016 entry price is still available. That’s a 2,660% return since batch 1. If you’re serious about early entry, this is the window. The combination of working tools, presale access, and ROI potential makes BlockDAG one of the most exciting crypto opportunities heading into 2025. 2. Mantle (MNT): $2B in Backing and a Token Engine Built for Growth Mantle brings a fresh take on Ethereum scaling, and unlike others, it has real firepower behind it. With more than $2 billion in BitDAO treasury assets backing it, Mantle has quickly emerged as one of the most financially secure Layer-2s. It’s not chasing temporary buzz. It’s quietly building out performance and governance using advanced modular data through EigenDA. Mantle’s strength lies in how its token MNT powers both gas and incentives across a wide network of builders and users. As BitDAO continues to fuel liquidity and development, MNT is set to increase in utility and circulation. If you want to invest in something that could shift from Ethereum sidekick to major player, Mantle is one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025 for exactly that reason. 3. Chainlink (LINK): The Data Powerhouse That Keeps Crypto Infrastructure Running Chainlink continues to cement its place as the leading data pipeline for decentralized apps. Whether it’s DeFi, NFTs, or even insurance protocols, Chainlink’s Oracle system delivers trusted, real-time data, price feeds, weather info, sports scores, and more. Chainlink’s value goes even deeper as AI and DePIN trends grow. With high-profile connections like Swift and DTCC already in its corner, this project is bridging crypto and traditional finance. That’s long-term strength you can’t ignore. While LINK doesn’t always deliver overnight returns, it’s built for resilience and reliability. For investors looking to bet on infrastructure rather than hype, Chainlink still earns its place among the best long-term cryptos for 2025. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Favorite to a Full-Built Ecosystem SHIB isn’t just riding the meme wave anymore. It now includes Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain; SHIB: The Metaverse; and ShibaSwap, its own decentralized exchange. That’s a huge leap for what started as a joke. What makes SHIB even more appealing now is its focus on reducing supply through active token burns, adding new staking options, and increasing real use cases. Shibarium now processes fees using BONE, showing how the project is linking different parts of its ecosystem. SHIB may still carry the meme coin label, but its loyal fanbase and development updates show it’s here to stay. If you’re looking for a high-upside pick, especially when retail interest kicks in, SHIB holds its place among the best long-term cryptos for 2025, even for risk-tolerant strategies. Which are the Best Long-Term Cryptos For 2025? Locking in on the best long-term cryptos for 2025 means choosing projects that deliver real access, solid development, and future-ready tools. BlockDAG checks every box, offering a live trading dashboard and an active $0.0016 price for presale buyers. Chainlink continues to support the core of the crypto stack, Mantle blends capital and design for scaling, and Shiba Inu shows how meme coins can grow up and deliver. Each fits a different style of investor, but BlockDAG is clearly the one turning heads right now. With a working product and limited pricing window, this is a rare setup that long-term investors can’t afford to miss. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

2025-08-06 15:00:14,49643418,1754492414,Ethereum Bears Dominate Market Orders: -$418.8M Daily Net Taker Volume Signals Trouble,"Ethereum is trading below the $3,700 level after days of heightened volatility and mounting uncertainty. The recent price action reflects a clear struggle by bulls to defend key demand zones, as bearish momentum continues to dominate short-term trends. Despite multiple rebound attempts, Ethereum has been unable to reclaim crucial resistance levels, raising concerns of a potential deeper correction in the near term. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Overheated? Key Signal Flashes Warning Similar To 2021 And 2024 Market Tops However, strong fundamentals such as increasing institutional adoption, network growth, and broader market developments continue to support the bullish thesis for Ethereum over the coming months. These structural tailwinds suggest that the current weakness may be part of a healthy consolidation phase before the next major upward move. Top analyst Maartunn shared key insights revealing that the Ethereum Net Taker Volume (Daily) has turned sharply negative, signaling a growing dominance of sell-side pressure. This metric quantifies the difference between market buy and sell orders, providing a clear view of the current sentiment among active traders. Ethereum Net Taker Volume Signals Bearish Dominance Top analyst Maartunn shared critical insights regarding Ethereum’s current market dynamics, emphasizing that Net Taker Volume for ETH sits at -$418.8 million (Daily). This figure indicates that taker sellers have offloaded approximately 115,400 more ETH than buyers were willing to absorb through market orders. Net Taker Volume measures the difference between buying and selling volumes executed at market prices, offering a direct view of the aggressiveness of traders prioritizing immediate execution over optimal pricing. Such a significant negative Net Taker Volume reflects that market participants with a bearish outlook are dominating order books, pushing sell orders aggressively into the market. This behavior signals that sellers are not waiting for better prices, highlighting a serious short-term bearish pressure that can weigh on Ethereum’s price in the immediate term. However, this bearish signal comes after weeks of intense bullish momentum where Ethereum surged aggressively, reaching a local high of $3,940. Given this context, some analysts interpret the current selling pressure as a healthy correction rather than a structural trend reversal. Despite the negative Net Taker Volume, Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals — including institutional accumulation, network growth, and broader adoption trends — remain intact. The current bearish dominance in futures markets serves as a short-term cautionary signal, but it does not yet suggest a breakdown of Ethereum’s overall bullish structure. Analysts will be closely monitoring whether ETH can stabilize and hold key support levels in the coming days. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Deepens As Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Hits One Of The Lowest Levels This Year ETH Price Analysis: Consolidation Below Key Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,624.67 after a volatile week marked by sharp pullbacks and failed breakout attempts. The daily chart shows ETH struggling to reclaim the critical resistance level at $3,860.80, which has become a psychological barrier after multiple rejections. Despite bouncing from a local low near $3,360, the bulls are finding it difficult to sustain momentum above the $3,700 zone. The 50-day moving average (MA) at $3,059.75 continues to slope upward, reflecting a longer-term bullish trend, while the 100-day MA at $2,742.48 and the 200-day MA at $2,503.32 act as major support zones. However, in the short term, price action indicates a bearish bias as ETH forms lower highs, suggesting weakening bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Selling More Aggressively As Bull Cycle Matures: Risk Appetite Fades? Trading volumes remain moderate, lacking the surge needed to propel Ethereum above resistance.

2025-08-06 15:00:00,49644010,1754492400,Top Cryptos to Buy Now for a Quick 30x Profit,"In a fast-shifting crypto market where narratives change by the hour, savvy investors are eyeing altcoins with strong fundamentals and untapped potential. While meme tokens like PEPE continue to dominate headlines, a new DeFi coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is quietly gaining traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sells at $0.035 in phase 6 of presale. Existing investors are guaranteed a 71.43% return when it goes live. Mutuum Finance has already sold more than $14.1 million and has more than 14,800 investors who have bought the token. Mutuum Finance could 30x immediately after launch. Pepe Coin (PEPE): Pullback After Memecoin Rally Pepe Coin is currently trading at approximately $0.0000123, having declined about 3–4% in the past 24 hours and retreating from last week’s peak of $0.0000131. The drop follows a strong month-long rally of over 30%, driven by whale accumulation and technical breakouts, but recent declines in volume and weakening RSI suggest meme-coin sentiment may be cooling. With speculative momentum fading, attention is increasingly shifting toward utility-led DeFi tokens such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Expands with Phase 6 Launch of Its Presale Mutuum Finance is showing strong performance in presale, selling out the 5th round ahead of schedule. The project is now in phase 6 at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is changing the face of the DeFi world by developing an extensible financial ecosystem with real-life applications. The presale attracted more than 14,800 token holders and has raised over $14.1 million. Claim Your Share of Mutuum Finance’s $100K Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance also launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be given a $10,000 prize in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is a testament to how committed the project is to developing a long-term and faithful fan base. As part of another drive towards transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team will be paying up to a maximum of $50,000 USDT to the participants for reporting likely vulnerabilities in the project. The goal of the bounty program is to obtain a suitable coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is segmented into the four classes of severity; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the team’s commitment towards security of ecosystem as well as confidence of investors. Two Tiers, One Powerful Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance is among the top DeFi projects whose customers fully retain control of their assets. The platform has a double-lending mechanism for provision of flexibility besides the efficiency that comprises Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract utilizes an automatically executing smart contract which carries out the lending independently without intervention, programmed to act on the fluctuating market prices. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates intermediaries and carries a potential for lenders to be directly linked with borrowers. It is even more common in meme coins as it carries a potential to enjoy pre-specified conditions. As memecoins like PEPE begin to lose steam after a major rally, investors are shifting focus to assets with stronger fundamentals and long-term growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming a standout in that category. The project has already raised over $14.1 million and attracted more than 14,800 investors in its presale. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, the token offers early backers a guaranteed 71.43% return at launch, and many believe that’s just the beginning. Analysts are eyeing the potential for 30x gains, driven by Mutuum’s dual lending model, real-world DeFi applications, and strong security credentials including a 95.0 CertiK trust score. Don’t miss Phase 6 before prices rise.

2025-08-06 14:57:26,49643290,1754492246,ADA or XLM? Unilabs Finance (UNIL) Could be the Next 10X Play – Position Well,"Investing at the current ADA price or XLM price can be likened to buying BTC at $120,000. Retailers aren’t only late but are backing the wrong horse, especially when there are more promising alternatives. One such is Unilabs Finance (UNIL) , a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager and one of the best new cryptos to invest in. How High Can the ADA Price Go This Cycle? The ADA price witnessed a 30% gain over the past 30 days, reaching $0.75. Also impressive is its monthly high of $0.92, although it currently trades significantly lower amid profit-taking among investors. However, trading volume is increasing, growing by 20% to $882 million over the past 24 hours. This gives an optimistic token price outlook, with a retest of $0.9 expected to push the ADA price toward its 2021 peak of $3.0. At the same time, according to Messari , mindshare is “high,” and FDV has surpassed $34.12 billion, indicating rising adoption of the smart contract platform. However, while a new ADA price ATH is feasible this cycle, a 10x gain might be a reach considering its large market cap of $26.7 billion. Can the XLM Price Explode by 10X? Following a 75% gain in the last thirty days, rookies might think the XLM price will always go up. However, a significant pullback is anticipated, which could push the altcoin from the current price of $0.41 toward its 30-day low of $0.23. Meanwhile, interest is declining. According to Messari , mindshare is “medium,” giving a bearish token price outlook. Additionally, the XLM price is in the red on the weekly chart. Losing the $0.40 support could spark a decline toward $0.30 before an even bigger sell-off. At the same time, technical indicators, notably the MACD and 20-VWMA, highlight rising selling pressure. While a rebound or a new XLM price ATH cannot be ruled out, the payment-based altcoin isn’t the best crypto to invest in due to its significant market size ($12.9 billion). Unilabs Finance (UNIL) — Is This The Next 10X Crypto Play? Unilabs Finance (UNIL) isn’t one of the top altcoins with limited upside potential, but a new and high-potential cryptocurrency. In just the sixth stage of the presale, it has surpassed $10.8 million in funding, positioning it among the top ICOs. Currently, a token is significantly discounted at $0.0097 and is projected to skyrocket by 415% at the listing price of $0.05. Unsurprisingly, seasoned investors have been loading up the UNIL token and positioning themselves in what experts believe to be one of the best new cryptos to invest in. Aside from its upside potential, Unilabs Finance’s novel AI Launchpad has been called a game-changer. This pioneering platform is designed to identify unconventional and early investment opportunities across promising narratives, such as AI, RWAs and DePIN. Despite its similarities to Virtuals Protocol, an AI launchpad with an $817 million market cap, UNIL has a competitive advantage due to its yield-sharing and governance features. Closing Thoughts Poised to explode after its much-anticipated debut, UNIL is one of the best new cryptos to invest in. Its appeal spans diverse narratives, notably AI and DeFi, making it more attractive. Meanwhile, at the current price of $0.085, UNIL is significantly discounted compared to the ADA price and XLM price.

2025-08-06 14:50:29,49644171,1754491829,"Roman Storm Jury Deadlocked, Judge Tells Them to Keep Deliberating","NEW YORK — The Manhattan jury tasked with deciding Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm’s fate told the court on Wednesday morning that they were deadlocked, unable to reach a unanimous verdict on at least one of the charges. The note to District Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York came on the fourth day of jury deliberations. According to reports from Inner City Press, Storm’s lawyers suggested that the court accept a partial verdict, while prosecutors requested that the jury be given an Allen charge — essentially, an instruction from the court to continue deliberating in an attempt to reach a unanimous verdict on all charges. Failla sided with prosecutors, bringing the jury into the courtroom and instructing them to try to reach a verdict, but telling them that it is their right not to agree or change their opinions, if an agreement truly cannot be reached. The jury’s notes over the past several days of deliberations have indicated that the jurors are carefully considering all facets of the case, including some of the more procedural aspects like venue. On the first day of deliberations, the jury asked what evidence of venue (basically, the prosecutors' justification to bring the case in the Southern District of New York) the prosecutors showed the grand jury in 2023 to obtain their indictment. Yesterday, the jury asked the judge for transcripts from the testimony of an FBI agent who did cell-site analysis on venture capitalist Tom Schmidt of Dragonfly Capital, who invested $900,000 in Tornado Cash’s parent company PepperSec Inc. The fact that Schmidt is based in New York was used by prosecutors to establish venue — but the jury, according to their note, seemed hesitant to accept this logic. In their note, they asked for transcripts of the agent’s testimony “to prove venue.” The jury has also asked questions about whether Storm was legally required to respond to requests for help from foreign law enforcement, and whether intermediary wallets were also included on the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s (OFAC) specially-designated nationals (SDN) list. Storm has been charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and conspiracy to violate international sanctions. If Storm is found guilty on all charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. Prosecutors say that, through Tornado Cash, Storm and his colleagues Alexey Pertsev and Roman Semenov, helped hackers and other cyber criminals — including North Korea’s state-sanctioned hacking squad, the Lazarus Group — launder over $1 billion in criminal proceeds.

2025-08-06 14:46:10,49642892,1754491570,This Level Could Be Bitcoin’s Hidden Trap Where Volatility Erupts,"Bitcoin has remained slightly in the red over the last 24 hours amid broad market caution triggered by uncertainty over advancing US trade tariffs. It is currently trading a little over $114K, but there is a potentially critical short-term price level for Bitcoin at $105,000. In fact, a cluster of realized price metrics places this level as a short‑term risk zone for downside pressure. Bitcoin’s Secret Danger Zone Drawing on Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) data and various cost-basis indicators, an analysis shared by CryptoQuant argues that this level could act as a hidden “danger zone” for leveraged traders. Previously, a similar gap around $111,000 was identified and later partially filled when Bitcoin retraced to $111,800, thereby validating the methodology behind the analysis. Now, updated UTxO metrics point to $105K as another key price to watch. According to the latest findings, a significant wall of realized transactions clusters tightly around $105,644, which suggests a large number of investors entered or exited positions at that level. Supporting this, Realized Price data for coins held between one and three months shows an average cost basis of approximately $106,000. Meanwhile, the Short-Term Holder Realized Price, a metric for BTC held less than 155 days, comes in at $105,350, which further reinforces the same threshold. Although there is no way to predict with certainty whether Bitcoin will revisit $105K, the clustering of critical cost metrics in this zone suggests it could be tested again, especially during bouts of volatility. This level does not imply a broader bearish shift, as the analyst maintains a bullish medium-to-long-term outlook. However, a dip to $105K could disproportionately impact futures traders with high leverage. This, in turn, can lead to liquidations and short-term dislocations. The analyst stated, “Because of that, it would be a smart choice for investors to be careful if the price moves down toward this level in the short term. They should try to lower the risk level of their positions and smoothen the volatility exposure of their portfolio.” $105K Level Gains More Attention Matrixport also highlighted the continued importance of the $105K level for Bitcoin, which aligns with its 21-week moving average. While it may be premature, or even overly bearish, to expect a test of this threshold, the firm considers it a reliable indicator of market trend: staying above suggests bullish momentum, while dropping below could imply a broader shift to bearish conditions. Although potential capital rotation from altcoins could limit downside risk, Matrxiport warned users of an overly optimistic stance.

2025-08-06 14:45:10,49642833,1754491510,Unprecedented Institutional Bitcoin Holdings: A July Surge of 166K BTC,"BitcoinWorld Unprecedented Institutional Bitcoin Holdings: A July Surge of 166K BTC A remarkable shift is underway in the cryptocurrency landscape, signaling growing confidence from major players. We recently witnessed a truly impressive surge in institutional Bitcoin holdings during July, with tracked entities adding a substantial 166,000 BTC to their portfolios. This massive Bitcoin accumulation by large-scale investors is a clear indicator of Bitcoin’s evolving role in global finance, suggesting a future where digital assets are integral to traditional investment strategies. What’s Driving This Significant Bitcoin Accumulation? According to insightful data from The Block, various tracked entities collectively purchased 166,000 BTC in July. This significant influx pushed their total Bitcoin holdings to an astounding 3.64 million BTC, valued at approximately $428 billion. A considerable portion of this July surge – roughly 107,000 BTC – came directly from public companies. This consistent corporate Bitcoin investment highlights a strategic pivot by major firms towards digital assets, recognizing their potential as long-term value stores. What exactly do we mean by “tracked entities”? These typically encompass a broad range of sophisticated investors and organizations, including: Publicly Traded Companies: Corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla, which have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. Private Investment Funds: Hedge funds, venture capital firms, and family offices increasingly allocating capital to digital assets. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) & Trusts: Vehicles like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding it. The sheer diversity and scale of these participants underscore a widespread, strategic belief in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and growth potential. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Holdings So Crucial? The increasing presence of institutions in the Bitcoin market carries profound implications, extending far beyond simple price movements. Historically, Bitcoin’s price was often characterized by extreme volatility, largely driven by retail speculation. However, as institutional Bitcoin holdings grow, several transformative effects become apparent: Market Maturation and Stability: Large, long-term institutional investors tend to reduce market volatility. Their substantial capital acts as a stabilizing force, leading to a more mature and predictable asset class. Enhanced Legitimacy: When established financial institutions and public companies commit significant capital, it lends immense credibility to Bitcoin. This validates Bitcoin as a serious, legitimate asset, attracting even more mainstream interest. Improved Liquidity: Greater institutional participation inherently improves market liquidity. This makes it easier for large transactions to occur without drastic price swings, fostering a healthier trading environment. This trend signifies more than just buying; it represents a strategic embrace of a new, global asset class that is rapidly gaining acceptance in traditional finance circles. How Does Corporate Bitcoin Investment Shape the Future? The July figures are not merely a standalone anomaly; they are a significant part of a broader, accelerating pattern of increasing BTC adoption by mainstream finance. Public companies, in particular, are leading this charge, viewing Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset, a hedge against inflation, or a vital component for portfolio diversification. This proactive digital asset strategy by corporations sends a powerful and unmistakable signal to the entire market. Consider the potential ripple effect of this growing trend: Wider Corporate Adoption: Other corporations might feel compelled to follow suit, observing the success and rationale behind these early institutional adopters. This could create a snowball effect. Regulatory Clarity: As institutional involvement deepens, regulators worldwide may feel increased pressure to establish clear, comprehensive frameworks, further legitimizing the space and reducing uncertainty. New Financial Products: The demand from institutions will likely spur the development of more sophisticated financial products and services tailored specifically for large-scale investors, expanding access and integration. While challenges like evolving regulatory landscapes and inherent market fluctuations persist, the consistent inflow of institutional capital paints an undeniably promising picture for Bitcoin’s long-term future and its integration into the global financial system. What’s Next for BTC Adoption? The substantial growth in institutional Bitcoin holdings during July is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. It solidifies its transition from a niche digital currency to a recognized, valuable asset class for major corporations and investment firms. This continued institutional interest is a key driver for Bitcoin’s long-term price stability, increased liquidity, and ultimately, its broader acceptance across the financial world. As more entities integrate Bitcoin into their comprehensive financial strategies, we can anticipate the emergence of an even more robust, mature, and globally integrated market. The path ahead may still have its inevitable bumps and market cycles, but the strong foundation laid by this significant Bitcoin accumulation points decisively towards an increasingly mainstream and influential future for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.

Proposal to add mmUSD to Aave pools appeared, then was quickly removed from forum. Community expects rapid adoption but notes high competition and unclear regulations. Reports have emerged on social network X (formerly Twitter) that MetaMask is considering launching its own mmUSD stablecoin, rumored to be developed in partnership with payment processor Stripe. The initiative first surfaced on the Aave Governance forum, where the TokenLogic group submitted a proposal on August 5, 2025, to add mmUSD to Aave v3 pools on Ethereum and Linea. However, the post was later removed from the forum, and screenshots of the proposal now circulate on social media as the only evidence. According to these reports, mmUSD is designed to ease blockchain interactions for MetaMask users, with Stripe integration targeting better regulatory compliance and lower transaction costs. Community members have shown significant interest, arguing that collaboration with Stripe could bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized platforms. Experts believe MetaMask’s large user base could help the new stablecoin gain traction rapidly. Special attention is given to the Seed Vault mechanism, which aims to enhance security for digital assets. mmUSD is expected to support DeFi transactions, payments for goods and services, and convenient transfers akin to traditional online payments. However, experts warn that launching a new stablecoin poses major risks due to stiff competition and regulatory uncertainty. Despite no official confirmation and the removal of the original proposal, discussion continues in the crypto community. MetaMask and Stripe have both declined to comment on the rumors.

2025-08-06 14:42:38,49643256,1754491358,Steve Witkoff’s three-hour meeting with Putin ended with no progress on Ukraine,"Steve Witkoff spent three hours in a closed-door meeting with Putin on Wednesday and walked away with absolutely nothing that could please Donald Trump. The Kremlin spun the meeting as “constructive and useful,” but that’s just Russian for “we didn’t agree on squat.” The meeting ended right before Trump’s sanctions deadline. The pressure was on, but Putin didn’t give an inch. Trump wanted progress toward a peace deal in Ukraine. Instead, Russia kept firing missiles. Since the last meeting between Witkoff and Putin back in April, Russia has actually ramped up attacks. Cities in Ukraine have been hit by nonstop drone strikes and missile barrages. Putin keeps stalling, Trump keeps waiting According to Russian state media TASS, RIA Novosti said, “Putin conveyed some signals to the United States on the Ukrainian issue. Corresponding signals were also received from President Trump.” But they didn’t say what those signals were. Nothing concrete. Just vague talk and spin. The Kremlin also said it’ll release more info after Witkoff reports back to Trump. So basically, ”we’ll tell you later.” Classic stall tactic. When Witkoff landed in Moscow, he was met by Russia’s investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Kremlin media showed a video of Witkoff shaking Putin’s hand before the talks began. That handshake turned out to be the only visible “progress.” Trump has been losing his patience for about a month now. In early July, he threatened Russia with new sanctions if they didn’t move toward peace in Ukraine. “We’re going to see what happens,” he said at the White House. “We’ll make that determination at that time.” That time has passed, and it’s obvious he’s not happy with the result. Behind closed doors, Trump has been calling Putin’s phone calls “tense,” accusing him of pushing “bullsh*t” about Ukraine. He’s also labeled Russia’s missile strikes “disgusting.” But the threats and insults haven’t made Putin even acknowledge them. Trump didn’t get what he wanted. And so, as usual, he lashed out somewhere else. Trump turns to India after Putin talks fail Minutes after learning the meeting flopped, Trump took action, going after India. The White House said it’s adding a 25% tariff on Indian imports. That pushes the total tariff rate to 50%. Trump signed an executive order saying: “I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent.” Trump had already warned India last week that tariffs were coming. He said they’d pay a 25% rate plus a “penalty” for buying weapons and energy from Russia. Until now, nobody knew what that penalty would be. On Tuesday, he made it clear during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He said he’d raise the tariff on India “very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they’re buying Russian oil, they’re fueling the war machine.” He added, “And if they’re going to do that, then I’m not going to be happy.” For four months, Washington kept teasing a new trade deal with India. Headlines were full of optimism. A deal looked close. Then everything fell apart. Trump turned that trade deal into a battlefield. It all started going downhill on July 30, when Trump accused China of supporting Putin and threatened a “penalty” for everyone involved. Days later, Indian officials said they would keep buying Russian oil, no matter what Trump said. That was the final straw. Now India is the new target. Trump’s trade war has a new front line. And it’s not just about economics anymore. It’s about leverage. If Putin won’t listen to Trump, Trump will hurt his customers. But if history tells us anything, Russia is not going to blink first.

2025-08-06 14:41:00,49643255,1754491260,DOGE Price Prediction: Dogecoin or Remittix? The Race To $1 In 2025 Is On,"As Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to maintain its bullish momentum, dropping nearly 30% from its recent highs, traders are eyeing alternatives with stronger upside potential in 2025. While DOGE price predictions still point to potential gains, many are now looking at Remittix (RTX) as the next breakout token ready to dominate the altcoin market. DOGE Price Struggles Amid Economic Uncertainty Dogecoin’s price rose to $0.28 recently, which was a five-month high, before falling back to $0.19, where it was testing key support levels. The decline has also been in line with the general market trends, such as policy uncertainty under the new import tariffs by President Trump and the Federal Reserve’s steady policy rates. Such macroeconomic forces have caused a rush to safe assets by many investors, which has also caused DOGE’s pullback. Nevertheless, the long-term direction has not changed yet since the technical indicators show that they are recovering. A golden cross formation in late July indicated a bullish outlook, but recent technical momentum indicators have become mixed, with DOGE’s RSI falling from overbought levels above 80 to below 50. Despite this, there’s potential for a rebound. Remittix Outpaces DOGE as It Gains Momentum While Dogecoin finds itself in a correction phase, Remittix is quietly surging forward with momentum. The token has already raised over $18.1 million and sold more than 582 million tokens at $0.0895 with no signs of slowing down. In contrast to DOGE’s reliance on meme coin sentiment, Remittix offers real-world utility in the DeFi space. The Remittix Wallet beta is set to launch September 15, offering full crypto wallet functionality designed for global cross-border payments and everyday transactions. Investors are flocking to Remittix, seeing it as a top altcoin to watch in 2025. Why Remittix Could Outperform DOGE in 2025 $18.1M+ Raised with strong institutional interest 40% Bonus for Early Buyers Q3 Wallet Beta Launching Sept 15 Real-World Utility in cross-border payments and DeFi transactions Massive Community Engagement Unlike DOGE, which remains subject to market whims and meme coin cycles, Remittix has a practical, future-facing use case that is already seeing adoption by businesses and freelancers globally. Investors Eye Remittix as the Real Breakout Token of 2025 Dogecoin’s future may still hold promise, but the price action remains volatile and its utility is limited compared to emerging altcoins like Remittix. As DOGE price predictions shift in response to market conditions, investors are looking for the next big thing and Remittix could very well be it. As DOGE price predictions remain uncertain for the near term, Remittix stands poised for rapid growth with its upcoming product releases and continued investor interest.

2025-08-06 14:40:11,49642646,1754491211,Tokenized Stocks: Unlocking a Trillion-Dollar Opportunity in Digital Assets,"BitcoinWorld Tokenized Stocks: Unlocking a Trillion-Dollar Opportunity in Digital Assets Imagine a world where owning a piece of a global company is as simple as holding a digital token. This vision is rapidly becoming reality, as tokenized stocks are emerging as a groundbreaking innovation in the financial landscape. Recent data from Binance Research indicates a massive shift, suggesting these digital assets could unlock a staggering $1.3 trillion market. This signals a significant turning point for blockchain finance and the broader investment world. What Are Tokenized Stocks, and Why Are They Important? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional shares, issued on a blockchain. This means you can own a fraction of a company’s stock as a digital token, enjoying the benefits of blockchain technology like transparency, efficiency, and accessibility. Binance Research, cited by Cointelegraph, revealed that the market capitalization for these innovative products surged to $370 million in July. This marks an impressive 220% increase from June, highlighting rapid adoption and growing investor interest. This remarkable growth isn’t just a fleeting trend. The report suggests that if only 1% of the global equities market undergoes equity tokenization , we could see a market size of $1.3 trillion. This potential signifies a pivotal moment for integrating traditional finance with cutting-edge blockchain technology. How Can Tokenized Stocks Reshape the Investment Landscape? The rise of tokenized stocks brings several compelling benefits that could revolutionize how we invest: Increased Accessibility: Blockchain allows for fractional ownership, meaning investors can buy smaller portions of high-value stocks. This opens up opportunities for a wider range of investors, regardless of their capital. Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7 on global platforms, potentially increasing market liquidity compared to traditional exchanges with limited operating hours. Greater Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public blockchain ledger, offering unparalleled transparency and reducing the risk of fraud. Lower Costs: Streamlined processes on the blockchain can reduce intermediary fees and settlement times, making investing more cost-effective. These advantages contribute to the overall crypto market growth narrative, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in financial services. What Challenges Do Tokenized Stocks Face? Despite the immense potential, the journey for tokenized stocks isn’t without hurdles. Key challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal and regulatory frameworks for these novel instruments are still evolving across different jurisdictions. Clear guidelines are crucial for widespread adoption. Scalability Concerns: As the market grows, blockchain networks must demonstrate the ability to handle a massive volume of transactions efficiently. Security Risks: While blockchain offers robust security, smart contract vulnerabilities or platform hacks remain a concern that requires continuous vigilance. Interoperability: Ensuring seamless interaction between various blockchain platforms and traditional financial systems is vital for mainstream integration. Addressing these challenges will be key to unlocking the full potential of digital assets in the equity market. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Future of Finance? The projections for tokenized stocks indicate a significant shift in how we perceive and interact with investments. For individual investors, this could mean new avenues for diversification and access to global markets previously out of reach. For financial institutions, it presents an opportunity to innovate and modernize their offerings, leveraging blockchain to create more efficient and inclusive financial products. This convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology is paving the way for a more interconnected and dynamic global economy. The continued expansion of blockchain finance could fundamentally alter market structures. The rapid ascent of tokenized stocks from a niche concept to a potential multi-trillion-dollar market highlights the transformative power of blockchain. Binance Research’s optimistic outlook underscores a future where digital assets play a central role in global equity markets. While challenges exist, the undeniable benefits of accessibility, transparency, and efficiency suggest that this innovation is here to stay, promising an exciting new era for investors worldwide.

2025-08-06 14:32:43,49642344,1754490763,"Binance’s CZ Moves to Reject FTX Lawsuit, Citing Offshore Dealings","CZ argues US courts lack authority in $1.76B FTX lawsuit due to offshore ties. Defense says Zhao was not recipient of funds, calls FTX claims “absurd.” FTX also files against ex-Binance execs; both CZ and SBF have served prison time. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has filed a motion in US bankruptcy court to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit brought by collapsed exchange FTX. CZ’s lawyers argue that the court lacks jurisdiction as he is a UAE resident and the questioned trades occurred outside the United States. The FTX lawsuit centers on a 2021 agreement in which Binance sold its stake in FTX. Plaintiffs allege that customer funds were used to repurchase these shares. Zhao’s legal team called these claims “absurd,” emphasizing that all transactions occurred through firms in Ireland, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands. According to FTX, the share buyback was financed with Binance USD (BUSD) digital assets and FTT tokens. However, Zhao’s defense states he “was not the recipient” of these funds and acted solely as a “nominal party.” A separate claim involves CZ’s social media posts in November 2022, when he announced Binance would sell its FTT tokens. Plaintiffs argue this triggered a wave of customer withdrawals. Zhao maintains the exchange collapsed due to its “fraudulent nature,” not his comments. His lawyers added, “Even if Mr. Zhao’s posts contributed to the crisis, FTX had no right to exist in the first place,” comparing the case to blaming a whistleblower for exposing a Ponzi scheme. In May 2025, Binance had already filed to dismiss the lawsuit, calling it “legally invalid.” FTX has also brought claims against former Binance executives Samuel Lim and Dinghua Xiao. CZ served four months in prison last year for anti-money laundering violations. Meanwhile, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud and is preparing an appeal.",News|Crypto,EN,0,cz argues u court lack authority ftx lawsuit due offshore tie defense say zhao recipient fund call ftx claim ftx also file exec cz sbf served prison time binance founder changpeng zhao cz filed motion u bankruptcy court dismiss billion lawsuit brought collapsed exchange ftx cz lawyer argue court lack jurisdiction uae resident questioned trade occurred outside united state ftx lawsuit center agreement binance sold stake ftx plaintiff allege customer fund used repurchase share zhao legal team called claim absurd emphasizing transaction occurred firm ireland cayman island british virgin island according ftx share buyback financed binance usd busd digital asset ftt token however zhao defense state recipient fund acted solely nominal separate claim involves cz social medium post november announced binance would sell ftt token plaintiff argue triggered wave customer withdrawal zhao maintains exchange collapsed due fraudulent nature comment lawyer added even zhao post contributed crisis ftx right exist first place comparing case blaming whistleblower exposing ponzi scheme may binance already filed dismiss lawsuit calling legally ftx also brought claim former binance executive samuel lim dinghua xiao cz served four month prison last year laundering violation meanwhile former ftx ceo sam currently serving sentence fraud preparing appeal,0.24,0.667,0.093,-0.9896,0
2025-08-06 14:32:25,49642335,1754490745,From April to Now: How FUNToken’s Price Growth Reflects Strong Community and Ecosystem Momentum,"In a year when many tokens struggled to maintain relevance, FUNToken ($FUN) has delivered one of the standout performances in the gaming crypto sector. Trading around $0.0188 at the time of writing, FUN has climbed from under $0.007 in early April - a remarkable surge that highlights the power of an engaged community and a disciplined roadmap. This article explores how this price growth was built on real momentum rather than speculation. Understanding the Price Climb Since April According to CoinMarketCap, FUNToken’s trajectory since April shows a clear, stepwise progression: ● Early April: Trading between $0.005 and $0.007, reflecting steady accumulation after a quiet Q1. ● May: Fluctuating in the $0.007–$0.009 range as new Telegram games launched and gained traction. ● June: Pulling back slightly, with the price returning closer to $0.007 as early gains cooled and the market consolidated. ● Early July: Climbing above $0.010 for the first time in this rally as momentum picked up again with stronger adoption. ● Mid-July: Surging further to around $0.0187 after the Q2 25 million token burn and sustained community engagement, marking nearly a 3X increase from April levels. This steady climb is notable because it was accompanied by rising transaction volumes and higher community engagement - both of which are strong indicators of durable growth rather than a temporary spike. The Role of Community Momentum Central to this performance has been the strength of the FUNToken community, especially on Telegram. The Telegram bot has become a daily destination for over 130,000 users, who log in to: ● Play casual games that distribute FUN rewards. ● Spin the Wheel of Fortune for prizes. ● Complete missions and earn bonuses. Meanwhile, the official Telegram channel has kept users informed about every milestone, including the Q2 burn and game launches. This consistent communication has built trust and kept momentum high throughout the rally. A Roadmap Delivering Real Results Another factor supporting the price surge is FUNToken’s clear, measurable roadmap . Key Q2 milestones laid the groundwork for adoption: ● 10 new mobile games launched across Android and iOS. ● The web-based FUN Wallet released to simplify token management. ● Unified login systems deployed for seamless gameplay. As Q3 and Q4 unfold, the project plans to launch staking inside the mobile wallet, expand to 30 live games, and forge partnerships with game studios. The $5 Million Giveaway: A Powerful Incentive Engine The $5 million giveaway has also played a critical role in strengthening community momentum. Unlike short-term promotions, this campaign is structured to reward: ● Long-term holding. ● Daily participation. ● Referrals that help grow the ecosystem organically. As more users join to qualify for rewards, the network effect increases. This dynamic helps explain why FUNToken’s price has continued climbing even when broader sentiment turned cautious. Why This Growth Looks Sustainable Several clear indicators suggest that FUNToken’s rally is not just a short-term surge but a trend anchored in strong fundamentals: Rising daily transaction volumes through Telegram gamesThe FUNToken Telegram bot has become a daily ritual for over 105,000 active users who play games, spin the Wheel of Fortune, and complete missions. Every spin and mission generates transactions, which not only fuel liquidity but also create the revenue stream that funds token burns. This high level of daily engagement shows that users aren’t here just for speculation - they’re actively participating in the ecosystem. Quarterly burns funded by real revenue, reducing circulating supplyUnlike many tokens that rely on buybacks from reserves or unsustainable inflationary models, FUNToken uses platform-generated revenue to buy back tokens on the open market and burn them. In June 2025, the project burned 25 million tokens, a concrete reduction in supply that is visible on-chain. As new games and staking go live, this burn volume is expected to grow, making the token scarcer over time. Consistent community engagement, driven by missions and giveawaysThe community isn’t just growing in size - it’s growing in loyalty. The ongoing $5 million giveaway rewards players for holding, staking, and referring to others. This has created a powerful incentive for users to stay active rather than cashing out quickly. Telegram missions, daily spins, and gamified quests keep the community engaged, while the official Telegram channel ensures everyone stays informed about updates and milestones. A clear roadmap, with each milestone delivering measurable progressFUNToken’s roadmap is a series of tangible milestones that the team has consistently executed. Q2 saw: ● The launch of 10 new mobile games ● The release of the web-based FUN Wallet Looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, the roadmap includes: ● Expanding the gaming catalog to 30 live titles ● Launching staking in the dedicated mobile wallet ● Partnering with third-party game studios ● Hosting the first Global FUN Gaming Summit This steady progress reduces uncertainty and reinforces confidence among investors and players. Together, these factors create a self-reinforcing loop: More adoption through games and rewards drives higher transaction volume. Higher revenue from gameplay funds quarterly burns and community incentives. Burns reduce the circulating supply, increasing scarcity. Scarcity supports price appreciation, attracting more users and media attention. More users fuel even more transactions, completing the cycle. This model has already proven itself over the past three months, and if FUNToken continues delivering on its roadmap, many believe this growth could continue well into 2026. Looking Forward: What’s Next for FUNToken With Q3 and Q4 set to deliver major initiatives, the next phases could build on this momentum: ● The launch of staking in the dedicated mobile wallet. ● Expansion to 30+ games with cross-game rewards. ● The first Global FUN Gaming Summit to attract partners and showcase innovation. ● Ongoing burn events that further tighten supply. If these milestones are achieved, many traders believe the upward trend that started in April could continue into 2026.

In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Gundlach says data used by the Fed to determine rates is full of estimates, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the cost of a basket of goods, and jobs reports. “I feel like this data that is coming out is getting much less reliable, and this has been building for a long time. People are saying that the surveys that get sent out to be filled out for the jobs report, only 60% are being responded to, and that’s been rising over time. Also, the CPI data is getting kind of suspect. Several years back, about 8% of CPI input prices were estimated. Now it’s 35%. It’s jumped way up. So 35% in the most recent CPI report of the inflation inputs are just kind of made up, and so people are starting to get really worried about the reliability of a lot of this data.” The Fed’s data has gained a lot of attention lately after the most recent jobs report showed jobs grew by just 73,000 last month, short of the expected 100,000, while July and May job numbers were drastically revised downward by a combined 258,000. The revisions have lead some to suspect the US economy is suddenly flashing a recession. Gundlach says that Fed will likely cut rates at its next meeting in September given the jobs data, and make at least one other cut before the year’s end. “I think it’s a virtual certainty that the Fed is going to cut rates. And in fact, now, even though there’s not that many meetings left in the year, we’re starting to see market pricing of perhaps as many as three rate cuts this year. I’m skeptical of that. One thing I’ve been consistent with all year is I think two rate cuts maximum here in 2025. Now I think that the data has weakened so substantially with these revisions that it’s possible that we get a third, but I still think my base case is two rate cuts this year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-08-06 14:30:53,49642867,1754490653,A new trend for XRP holders: Start blockchain cloud mining and easily earn daily income,"Breaking the traditional trading model, cloud mining has become the new favorite in the crypto market As the competition in the global crypto market becomes increasingly fierce, more and more XRP holders are beginning to seek to break through the traditional “ buy low and sell high ” profit model. In the context of volatile market conditions and the failure of short-term trading strategies, a new way to increase the value of digital assets is quietly emerging: Blockchain Cloud Mining cloud mining platform. It not only subverts the technical threshold of traditional mining, but also allows a large number of XRP users to realize the dream of “no need to trade, no need to watch the market, and automatic daily income”. Cloud mining: the “cash flow re-creation machine” of digital assets In traditional concepts, digital assets mainly make profits in two ways: one is to sell arbitrage after the price of the currency rises; the other is to participate in lending or liquidity mining through decentralized finance (DeFi) . But these methods are often accompanied by high risks and technical barriers. In contrast, Blockchain Cloud Mining ‘s “contract cloud mining” model is more suitable for the majority of XRP holders to achieve low participation and high stability income goals. BlockchainCloudMining Platform Advantages at a Glance ⦁ Get $12 Instant Bonus Upon Signing Up. ⦁ High Profit Level and Daily Payouts. ⦁ No Other Service Fees or Management Fees. ⦁ The platform supports settlement of more than 9 cryptocurrencies, such as DOGE, BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT, XRP, LTC, and BCH. ⦁ The company’s affiliate program allows you to refer friends and receive up to $50,000 in referral bonuses. ⦁McAfee® Security. Cloudflare® Security. 100% Uptime Guarantee and Excellent 24/7 Human Online Technical Support. How to Start BlockchainCloudMining and Earn Stable Income Step 1: Register an Account You can register an account by entering your email address and setting a platform login password. After registration, you will receive a $12 registration bonus, which can be used to purchase $12 contracts, with a daily income of $0.6. This program provides users with free cloud mining services without any financial risk. Step 2: Purchase a mining contract BlockchainCloudMining offers a variety of mining contract options, such as $100, $500, and $1,000 contracts. Each contract has a unique return on investment (ROI) and a specific contract period. You can earn more efficient and stable income by participating in the following contracts： ⦁【New User Experience Contract】: Investment amount: $100, contract period 2 days, total income: $100 + $6. ⦁【WhatsMiner M66S】: Investment amount: $500, contract period 7 days, total income: $500 + $45.5. ⦁【WhatsMiner M60】: Investment amount: $1,000, contract period 14 days, total return: $1,000 + $196. ⦁【Bitcoin Miner S21+】: Investment amount: $3,000, contract period 20 days, total return: $3,000 + $900. ⦁【ALPH Miner AL1】: Investment amount: $10,000, contract period 35 days, total return: $10,000 + $5,950. ⦁【ANTSPACE HK3】: Investment amount: $33,000, contract period 40 days, total return: $33,000 + $26,400. You can get income the next day after purchasing the contract, or you can choose to withdraw to your crypto wallet or continue to purchase other contracts . (The platform has launched a variety of stable income contracts, for more contract details, please log in to the official website of Blockchaincloudmining.com) Analysis by professional institutions: Stable income model may become the mainstream trend According to trend reports released by several crypto investment research institutions, as the market enters a mature stage, short-term speculators are gradually replaced by long-term income investors. Cloud mining platforms like BlockchainCloudMining will become an indispensable infrastructure for the future crypto market. A researcher at blockchain analysis company CryptoMetrics said: “Users of mainstream currencies, represented by XRP , naturally pay more attention to asset security and value-added logic. They are very receptive to stable income products, especially in periods of high volatility, and are more willing to invest part of their assets in the BlockchainCloudMining platform for risk hedging.” Conclusion: A new era of crypto investment has quietly begun For XRP users, BlockchainCloudMining is not a speculative product, but a smarter way of asset management. Here, XRP is no longer just a trading chip, but a financial asset that can generate sustainable income. As more and more users realize the sense of freedom brought by “daily stable income”, cloud mining will no longer be exclusive to miners, but a value engine that every coin holder can participate in.

2025-08-06 14:30:43,49642498,1754490643,Litecoin Soars 41% While Nexchain Presale Hits $8M Milestone,"Nexchain has reached a new milestone in the crypto presale market, raising more than $8 million in its ongoing token sale. Stage 24 of the presale crypto is now active, with NEX tokens priced at $0.096. The planned listing price of $0.30 represents a potential 313% return for early buyers. The project confirmed the achievement in a post on X, stating that $8,034,260 has been raised toward its $8,475,000 stage goal. The team credited the support of its community for driving growth in this new crypto presale, acknowledging both long-term backers and recent participants. We’ve just hit a major milestone in our presale: $8,000,000 raised. But this isn’t about the number – it’s about you. Your support, your trust, your constant energy – that’s what made this possible. From day-one backers to those who just joined – every single one of you is part… — Nexchain (@nexchain_ai) August 5, 2025 Nexchain is a web3 crypto presale that focuses on delivering blockchain functionality. The NEX token will support governance, staking, multi-chain interaction, and smart contracts. By providing practical features instead of relying solely on speculation, the project aims to position its presale coin as a platform for long-term network participation. Litecoin Gains 41% Following Corporate Accumulation While Nexchain advances its crypto presale, Litecoin (LTC) is showing strong price movement in the wider market. The token trades near $124, representing a 41% gain over the past month. The surge follows MEI Pharma’s decision to acquire 929,548 LTC at an average price of $107.58, a purchase valued at over $110 million. This acquisition makes the company the first US-listed public firm to adopt Litecoin as a core reserve asset. The purchase was carried out with GSR and guided by Litecoin founder Charlie Lee. Market analysts point to this corporate adoption as a key driver behind the recent price increase, positioning Litecoin as one of the few major cryptocurrencies posting gains in a mixed market environment. Airdrop and Testnet Engage Early Users Nexchain’s presale crypto momentum is supported by its active airdrop and an upcoming testnet release. The airdrop began on July 14, allowing users to earn NEX tokens through simple participation tasks. This initiative has helped introduce new users to the network and reward early engagement. The testnet will launch on August 8. It will allow participants and developers to experience the platform’s transaction speeds, cross-chain functionality, and hybrid Proof-of-Stake consensus. This consensus design includes adaptive optimization to enhance performance. Offering early access during the web3 crypto presale stage builds confidence among participants and allows the team to showcase the technology before the mainnet goes live. By combining token rewards with hands-on testing, Nexchain is strengthening its position among new crypto presale projects that aim to combine community growth with technical delivery. Market Balances Established Coins and Presale Growth The market is currently showcasing two active trends. Established tokens like Litecoin are benefiting from institutional adoption and price resilience. At the same time, presale crypto offerings like Nexchain provide early access to projects aiming for network utility and long-term use. With Nexchain’s new crypto presale nearing its Stage 24 target and Litecoin maintaining strong momentum, both represent different paths for market participation. Investors seeking stability are monitoring coins like LTC, while early participants in presale coin launches are looking toward blockchain projects that aim to deliver Web3 infrastructure.

2025-08-06 14:30:11,49642214,1754490611,Ethereum Treasury: Cosmos Health Secures $300M for Bold Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Treasury: Cosmos Health Secures $300M for Bold Strategy In a surprising yet significant development, Nasdaq-listed global healthcare company Cosmos Health (NASDAQ: COSM) recently announced a landmark crypto investment . The firm secured up to $300 million to establish an Ethereum treasury , marking a bold step into the evolving landscape of institutional crypto adoption. This strategic move highlights a growing trend among traditional companies embracing a diversified digital asset strategy . What Does This Bold Move Mean for Cosmos Health ? Cosmos Health, a prominent global healthcare company, entered into an agreement with a U.S. institutional investor. This deal involves issuing up to $300 million in senior secured convertible notes. Such notes offer a pathway for the investor to convert their debt into equity under specific conditions. A substantial portion of these proceeds, at least 72.5%, will go directly towards building the company’s Ethereum treasury . The remaining funds will support essential working capital and various growth initiatives. This financial maneuver provides Cosmos Health with significant liquidity and potentially a new avenue for asset appreciation. Why an Ethereum Treasury ? Understanding the Digital Asset Shift Many might wonder why a healthcare company would choose to build an Ethereum treasury . Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a robust ecosystem. It powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless other innovations. Holding Ethereum in a corporate treasury signifies more than just a speculative bet. It represents an acknowledgment of digital assets as legitimate store-of-value and growth instruments. Moreover, this move by Cosmos Health could inspire other traditional firms to consider similar diversification, further solidifying institutional crypto adoption. The Broader Impact of Institutional Crypto Adoption Cosmos Health’s decision to allocate a significant sum to an Ethereum treasury is not an isolated incident. Increasingly, major corporations and financial institutions are exploring or actively integrating cryptocurrencies into their balance sheets or services. This trend validates the growing maturity of the digital asset market. When established companies like Cosmos Health make such moves, it lends credibility to the entire crypto space. It signals to a wider audience that digital assets are becoming a serious component of a forward-thinking digital asset strategy . This can lead to increased mainstream acceptance and potentially greater market stability. Navigating the Future: Digital Asset Strategy and Growth Implementing a digital asset strategy , especially one involving substantial crypto investment , comes with its own set of considerations. Volatility remains a key characteristic of the crypto market. Therefore, companies must approach such strategies with careful risk management and a long-term perspective. However, the potential benefits, including portfolio diversification, inflation hedging, and access to new financial ecosystems, are compelling.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum treasury? An Ethereum treasury refers to a company holding a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) as part of its corporate reserves or balance sheet, similar to how a company might hold fiat currency or gold. Why did Cosmos Health choose Ethereum for its treasury? Cosmos Health likely chose Ethereum due to its established position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, its robust ecosystem supporting decentralized applications, and its perceived long-term value and utility within the digital asset space. What are senior secured convertible notes? Senior secured convertible notes are a type of debt instrument issued by a company that can be converted into a specified number of shares of the company’s common stock. They are ‘secured’ by specific assets and ‘senior’ in the event of liquidation, meaning they get paid before other, junior debts. How does this move impact institutional crypto adoption? Cosmos Health’s significant investment in an Ethereum treasury provides further validation for institutional crypto adoption. It demonstrates that traditional, publicly traded companies are increasingly comfortable integrating digital assets into their core financial strategies, potentially encouraging others to follow suit. Are there risks involved in this digital asset strategy? Yes, like any investment, holding digital assets carries risks. These include market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security concerns. Companies undertaking such a digital asset strategy typically implement robust risk management frameworks.

2025-08-06 14:25:11,49642065,1754490311,Trump Tariffs India: Unveiling the Shockwave of 25% Import Duties,"BitcoinWorld Trump Tariffs India: Unveiling the Shockwave of 25% Import Duties The financial world just received a jolt! Reports from Walter Bloomberg on X indicate that U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order, imposing a significant 25% additional tariff on goods imported from India. This sudden move regarding Trump tariffs India is sending ripples across international markets and raises immediate questions about the future of global commerce. What does this mean for businesses, consumers, and the intricate dance of international relations? Understanding the Immediate Impact of Trump Tariffs India This surprising announcement marks a pivotal moment in the bilateral relationship. A 25% levy on various Indian goods entering the U.S. market can significantly alter pricing and competitiveness. Many industries, from textiles to pharmaceuticals, rely heavily on access to the American consumer base. Therefore, this development presents an immediate challenge. Increased Costs: Indian exporters will face higher costs, making their products less attractive to U.S. buyers. Reduced Demand: U.S. importers may seek alternative, cheaper sources, potentially reducing demand for Indian goods. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses with established supply chains between the two nations may need to re-evaluate their strategies. This direct action highlights a growing trend of protectionist measures in the global economy. What Does This Mean for US India Trade ? The relationship between the United States and India has been complex, often characterized by strategic partnerships alongside trade disagreements. This new imposition of import tariffs on Indian goods could strain these ties further. Historically, both nations have worked towards increasing bilateral trade, which reached significant figures in recent years. This tariff, however, could reverse some of that progress. Consider the potential ramifications: Bilateral Dialogue: It might prompt urgent diplomatic discussions to de-escalate the situation. Retaliatory Measures: India could consider imposing its own tariffs on U.S. goods, leading to a tit-for-tat scenario. Shift in Focus: Indian exporters might pivot to other markets, seeking new trade agreements to offset losses from the U.S. market. The trajectory of US India trade now faces a period of uncertainty, demanding careful navigation from policymakers and businesses alike. Navigating the Waters: The Broader Economic Impact India Could Face Beyond the immediate trade figures, the ripple effect of these import tariffs could extend throughout the Indian economy. Sectors heavily reliant on exports to the U.S. might experience slowdowns, potentially affecting employment and investment. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) could be particularly vulnerable, as they often have fewer resources to absorb increased costs or pivot to new markets quickly. However, every challenge can also present an opportunity. This situation might accelerate India’s push for self-reliance and diversification of its trade partners. It could encourage domestic manufacturing and consumption, reducing reliance on specific export markets. The economic impact India experiences will depend largely on how quickly and effectively the government and businesses adapt to this new trade environment. Looking Ahead: The Future of Import Tariffs and Global Trade Tensions This development is not isolated; it fits into a broader pattern of rising global trade tensions . Nations are increasingly using tariffs as tools in economic diplomacy, aiming to protect domestic industries or address perceived imbalances. While such measures aim to benefit domestic sectors, they often lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced overall trade volumes globally. The imposition of these Trump tariffs India reminds us of the delicate balance in international commerce. Businesses must now become more resilient, agile, and diversified in their operations. Policymakers, on the other hand, face the complex task of balancing national interests with the need for stable and open global trade systems. The coming months will reveal the true extent of these tariffs’ influence and whether they signal a lasting shift in international trade policy. In conclusion, the announcement of a 25% tariff on Indian imports by former President Trump marks a significant development for US India trade relations. While it presents immediate challenges for Indian exporters and could lead to a broader economic impact India , it also highlights the need for adaptability and diversification in a world of increasing global trade tensions . Staying informed and agile will be crucial for navigating these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are the Trump tariffs on Indian imports? A1: U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on goods imported from India, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X. This means a 25% tax is added to the cost of these specific Indian products entering the U.S. market. Q2: Which Indian goods are affected by the 25% tariff? A2: While the initial report from Walter Bloomberg on X indicates a general 25% tariff on ‘goods imported from India,’ the specific list of affected products would typically be detailed in the executive order itself. Historically, such tariffs have targeted sectors like textiles, agricultural products, or pharmaceuticals. Q3: How might India respond to these import tariffs? A3: India could respond in several ways, including diplomatic negotiations to seek a resolution, or by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs on specific U.S. goods. Another strategy could involve accelerating efforts to diversify its export markets and reduce reliance on the U.S. Q4: What is the potential economic impact on India? A4: The potential economic impact India faces includes increased costs for exporters, reduced demand for Indian goods in the U.S., and possible disruptions to supply chains. This could lead to slowdowns in export-oriented sectors, affecting employment and investment, especially for smaller businesses. Q5: How do these tariffs affect US consumers? A5: For U.S. consumers, these import tariffs could lead to higher prices for goods imported from India. If importers pass on the increased costs, consumers might pay more for certain products, or they may find fewer options as businesses shift away from Indian suppliers.

2025-08-06 04:25:10,49618425,1754454310,US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Alarming Outflows: What’s Next?,"BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Alarming Outflows: What’s Next? The world of cryptocurrency investment is always buzzing, and recent data has certainly captured attention. On August 5, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a notable combined net outflow of $196.2 million. This marks the fourth consecutive trading day of such outflows, indicating a potential shift in investor sentiment within the digital asset space. What Triggered These Significant Bitcoin ETF Outflows? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the fourth consecutive day of Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 5 paints a clear picture. Investors pulled a substantial amount from these popular investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Let’s look at the specifics of these significant movements: Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows, seeing $99.1 million exit its coffers. BlackRock’s IBIT followed, experiencing $77.4 million in outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also contributed, with $19.7 million in net outflows. Interestingly, the remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, suggesting the outflows were concentrated in a few key players. How Do These Outflows Impact the Crypto Market? These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows naturally raise questions about their broader implications for the crypto market . While a single day or even a few days of outflows don’t necessarily signal a long-term bearish trend, they do reflect immediate investor behavior and market sentiment. Such movements can contribute to short-term price volatility for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Understanding the reasons behind these shifts is crucial. Several factors could be at play: Profit-taking: Investors might be cashing out after periods of gains. Macroeconomic concerns: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, including digital asset holdings. Regulatory developments: Any news or speculation regarding cryptocurrency regulation can influence investor confidence. Market volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market itself can prompt some investors to seek safer havens. What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Funds and ETF Performance? The recent figures provide a snapshot of current ETF performance for some of the largest digital asset funds . While the overall trend for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs since their inception has been positive, periods of outflows are a natural part of any investment cycle. They serve as a reminder that even established investment vehicles linked to cryptocurrencies are subject to market dynamics. For investors, it’s important to differentiate between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. These outflows highlight the need for continued monitoring of: Institutional interest: Are large institutions still accumulating or are they pulling back? Retail participation: How are individual investors reacting to market movements? Underlying Bitcoin fundamentals: The strength of Bitcoin’s network and adoption remains a key factor. This data provides valuable insight into how capital is flowing in and out of the regulated crypto investment space. Looking Ahead: Navigating the Crypto Market The recent outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a significant event, but they are just one piece of the larger crypto market puzzle. For investors, the key is to remain informed and adopt a measured approach. While headlines about large outflows can seem daunting, they are often part of a healthy market’s ebb and flow. Consider these actionable insights: Stay informed: Continuously track data from reliable sources like Farside Investors. Diversify: Don’t put all your investment eggs in one basket. Long-term perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of digital assets rather than daily price swings. Risk assessment: Understand your personal risk tolerance before making investment decisions. These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a timely reminder of the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. By understanding the underlying factors and maintaining a clear perspective, investors can better navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to buy, store, or secure the actual cryptocurrency. 2. What caused the recent Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 5? The specific causes can be complex, but common reasons for such Bitcoin ETF outflows include investor profit-taking, reactions to broader macroeconomic conditions, shifts in crypto market sentiment, or responses to regulatory news affecting digital asset funds . 3. How do these outflows affect the overall crypto market? While not solely indicative of the entire market’s health, significant outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price in the short term. They also reflect investor confidence and can influence sentiment across the broader crypto market . 4. Is this a long-term trend for digital asset funds? It is too early to determine if this is a long-term trend. Outflows are a normal part of fund management and ETF performance . Investors should monitor subsequent trading days and broader market conditions to assess whether this represents a sustained shift or a temporary adjustment. 5. What should investors do in response to these outflows? Investors should avoid panic and focus on their long-term investment strategies. It’s crucial to stay informed, consider diversifying portfolios, and evaluate personal risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance is always recommended.

2025-08-06 04:24:23,49618781,1754454263,"DOGE Sheds 5% as Volume Quadruples, Testing Key Support Zones","Meme coin DOGE extended its slide on Monday, falling through support levels and triggering fresh selling interest as broader market risk appetite collapsed. What to Know Dogecoin fell 5% over the 24-hour session from August 4 at 21:00 to August 5 at 20:00, declining from $0.21 to $0.20. The token traded within a $0.013 range, with lows of $0.198 and highs of $0.211. A key liquidation event occurred during the 14:00 hour on August 5, with volumes reaching 877.9 million — nearly 4x the 24-hour average of 268.85 million — triggering a breakdown below $0.205. DOGE ended the session at $0.1985 after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones, signaling continued institutional selling and confirming new downside momentum. The move comes amid broader crypto market weakness triggered by risk-off sentiment across global equities. News Background DOGE’s decline coincided with institutional outflows from crypto-linked ETFs totaling $223 million over the past week, per CoinShares data. Federal Reserve hawkishness and renewed geopolitical concerns — including retaliatory tariffs and commodity flow disruptions — have fueled risk aversion across both traditional and crypto markets. At the same time, the meme coin sector remains under pressure as retail enthusiasm fades and large holders continue to rotate into higher-beta altcoins or cash positions. DOGE had previously shown signs of accumulation last week, but failure to hold the $0.205 level invalidated the setup. Price Action Summary DOGE began the session strong, hitting $0.211 at 01:00, but reversed sharply through the day. The steepest decline occurred at 14:00, when price dropped from $0.205 to $0.199 amid 877.9 million in volume. By 19:51, another flush to $0.1975 occurred on 19.04 million volume — more than 70x the hourly average — before a shallow bounce to $0.1985 into the close. New resistance has formed near $0.205, with price unable to sustain any recovery above that level following the breakdown. The token currently trades near session lows and shows no confirmation of a reversal. Technical Analysis DOGE traded within a 6% range between $0.198 and $0.211 Volume spiked to 877.9 million at 14:00, nearly 4x above daily average Rejection at $0.205 triggered mid-session breakdown Support attempted at $0.198-$0.199, but volume on bounce remained weak Final hour saw 19.04M volume burst at $0.1975 level, creating local resistance at $0.1988 Momentum remains to the downside unless price reclaims $0.205 on convincing volume What Traders Are Watching Traders are closely watching whether DOGE can stabilize above $0.198 or face further downside toward $0.185.

The Galaxy Digital founder and CEO made the comments Tuesday during the firm’s second-quarter earnings call . “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” Novogratz said. “The question now is which of the existing companies become monsters.” Favorable US Rules Fuel Growth in Crypto Treasury Firms Crypto treasury companies have gained momentum in recent quarters, especially as US regulatory conditions have become more favorable. These firms raise capital in public markets and allocate a portion or all of their reserves into digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain-based tokens. A growing list of public companies has adopted this approach. That includes Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), GameStop, Trump Media & Technology Group, SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital. Their holdings span Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Litecoin. Ethereum already has two major corporate treasury holders, Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink. Novogratz expects both to keep expanding but warned that new entrants may “have a harder time getting oxygen” as the space becomes more saturated. Novogratz Sees Recurring Revenue From Treasury Partnerships Galaxy Digital manages crypto holdings for more than 20 treasury-focused firms. The company earns fees for overseeing these assets, which now total around $2b on its platform. Novogratz described it as “recurring income that will go on and on.” In May, Galaxy shifted its public listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market. It now trades under the ticker symbol GLXY, marking a strategic move to deepen its US footprint. @galaxyhq has explored the tokenization of its $GLXY shares and reported a 43% drop in total assets to $6.3 billion in Q2. #GLXY #Tokenization https://t.co/2go2wQ7tLn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The company also disclosed in a SEC filing that it is exploring tokenization of its publicly traded shares . That initiative forms part of Galaxy’s broader effort to expand into blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Founded in 2018, Galaxy Digital offers a wide range of crypto-focused services, including asset management, trading, investment banking and infrastructure solutions. It targets institutional clients looking to gain exposure to digital assets. Novogratz suggested the market’s attention is turning away from the influx of new treasury players.

2025-08-06 04:10:19,49619394,1754453419,What crypto to buy as SHIB team gets accused of selective project support,"MUTM is gaining traction with its structured presale and real-world utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already surged 250% from its initial presale price of $0.01 to $0.035 in Phase 6. Over $14,100,000 has been raised, with 665 million tokens sold to 14,800 holders. With Phase 6 selling out fast, the next phase will increase the price by 14.3% to $0.04. Early buyers stand to gain a 71% ROI at launch, where MUTM will list at $0.06. Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces backlash over unequal support Shiba Inu’s leadership is under fire for allegedly favoring specific projects like Positions Exchange (POE). Key figures, including Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya, publicly endorsed POE’s IDO, triggering backlash from other Shibarium-based platforms. WoofSwap, a leading decentralized exchange on Shibarium, accused the team of creating an uneven playing field. Dhairya defended the team’s actions but admitted the ecosystem struggles with disunity. He urged the community to prioritize collective growth over internal disputes. Despite the controversy, SHIB remains a prominent meme coin, but the selective support allegations have raised concerns about long-term fairness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale gains momentum Simultaneously, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates remarkable presale traction, presenting a distinct opportunity. Investors are actively participating in Phase 6, purchasing tokens at $0.035 each. The project has impressively raised $14,100,000 since its presale initiation. Furthermore, over 665 million tokens have found buyers, held by 14,800 distinct addresses. Phase 6 is currently underway and selling out rapidly. Consequently, the window for acquiring tokens at this price point is narrowing significantly. The subsequent Phase 7 will introduce a 14.3% price increase, setting the cost at $0.04 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will officially list at $0.06. Therefore, purchasing during Phase 6 potentially guarantees a 71% return on investment at launch. Crypto prices today reflect growing confidence in this new crypto coin. Mutuum security and incentives Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The team successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit, achieving an outstanding 95.00 security score. This result signifies a robust security posture. Complementing this, Mutuum Finance launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is allocated for identifying issues. Rewards are tiered based on severity: critical, major, minor, and low, ensuring all vulnerability levels are covered. Additionally, Mutuum Finance introduced a dashboard featuring a leaderboard of its top 50 holders. These holders will receive bonus token rewards for maintaining their positions, fostering long-term commitment. Crypto investing often prioritizes such security assurances and holder incentives. Major giveaway underway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also generating excitement through a substantial giveaway. The project is awarding a total of $100,000 in MUTM tokens , distributed among ten winners. Each victor will receive $10,000 worth of tokens. Participation requires specific actions. Firstly, entrants must submit a valid wallet address for potential prize receipt. Secondly, completing all designated quests is mandatory to maximize winning chances. Thirdly, eligibility demands a minimum $50 investment in the Mutuum Finance presale. This initiative fuels considerable community engagement. Many see it as a compelling reason to explore this new cryptocurrency. Projected growth trajectory Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility within decentralized finance. Its core function involves facilitating peer-to-peer lending and borrowing via smart contracts. The protocol will also feature an overcollateralized stablecoin system, minted only during loans and burned upon repayment. This design ensures stability and combats inflation. Analysts project substantial post-launch growth for MUTM. Conservative estimates suggest reaching $0.10 seems highly achievable. More optimistic crypto predictions indicate potential surges towards $0.50 within the next year. Such growth would deliver significant returns for Phase 6 participants. Crypto charts will likely track this ascent closely. Act during Phase 6 opportunity The Shiba Inu situation underscores governance challenges in crypto. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clear presale opportunity with defined returns. Phase 6 provides immediate access before the price climbs to $0.04. Early investment secures a position before the token lists at $0.06. Investors seeking promising new crypto options should evaluate Mutuum Finance (MUTM) based on its progress, security, and real-world application.

2025-08-06 04:04:46,49617636,1754453086,Binance Founder CZ Asks Court to Dismiss $1.76B Clawback Lawsuit Filed by FTX,"Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has asked a bankruptcy court to dismiss him from a $1.76 billion clawback suit filed by the FTX trust. The now-bankrupt FTX claims that the funds were “improperly transferred” by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to Bloomberg Law , CZ claimed that he’s a resident of the United Arab Emirates and that the FTX trust can’t claim it is within Delaware’s jurisdiction. “The complaint does not establish general jurisdiction because it does not allege that Mr. Zhao is ‘at home’ in Delaware,” Zhao said in a motion to dismiss filed on Monday in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Further, he emphasized that the claims have minimal relevance to the US and that the regulations involved have no “extraterritorial application.” FTX Wants to Recoup $1.76B From Binance: Here’s Why In November 2024, FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance exchange and its founder CZ. FTX sought to recover $1.76 billion from Binance, claiming it was transferred as part of a fraudulent transaction. FTX has sued @binance and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance for $1.8B, alleging fraudulent dealings that damaged its stability. #FTX #Binance https://t.co/WaIpSYlx4v — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 11, 2024 The $1.76 billion transaction was a 2021 share purchase agreement that Binance made with FTX, which the latter claims was fraudulent due to its insolvency at the time. A Binance spokesperson said at the time that the exchange would defend itself against the “meritless” claims. This isn’t the first time Binance has filed a motion to dismiss FTX’s $1.76 billion clawback suit. A similar court paper submitted in May to a Delaware judge noted that the beleaguered company attempted to hold Binance accountable for FTX’s crash, and “shift the blame” away from Sam Bankman-Fried. FTX “Nonsensically Blame” CZ And Binance The Monday motion read that the FTX trust “nonsensically blame” CZ and Binance for Bankman-Fried’s “pervasive malfeasance”. “The claims are in any event legally unfounded, and many are outright incoherent,” it added. Further, Zhao said that the constructive fraud claims don’t meet legal requirements that permit “qualifying transactions” linked to a securities contract under federal law. CZ pled guilty to US anti-money laundering violations and served four months in prison . Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted of several offences, including fraud and conspiracy.

In a post, the MSS described a case in which a foreign firm offered crypto token rewards to scan users' irises around the world. Join the crypto policy conversation Sept. 10 in D.C. — Register now for CoinDesk: Policy & Regulation . The company later transferred the biometric data abroad, raising concerns about both personal data privacy and national security. While the company wasn’t named, the description closely matches Worldcoin, the crypto project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which exchanges tokens for iris scans in a bid to build a global identity network. The project has already faced regulatory pushback in Germany, France , and Kenya , CoinDesk previously reported, where concerns have been raised over informed consent, data storage, and surveillance potential. Beijing's advisory goes further, citing other cases where stolen facial data has allegedly been used by foreign intelligence services to deepfake identities, allowing spies to infiltrate secure locations.

2025-08-06 04:00:52,49619760,1754452852,"SEC Commissioner Peirce Urges Lawmakers To Protect Crypto Privacy Rights, Open-Source Developers","US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce has called for the protection of crypto privacy rights and open-source development ahead of the crucial verdict of the Tornado Cash co-founder’s trial. In Defense Of Crypto Privacy, Developers On Monday, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce defended the crypto privacy sector, affirming that US authorities should welcome privacy-protecting technologies and safeguard individuals’ right to self-custody their digital assets. At the Science of Blockchain Conference, the crypto-friendly commissioner stated that lawmakers and regulators must take concrete steps to protect individuals’ ability to transact privately and develop privacy software without fear of prosecution. Peirce highlighted that a recent President’s Working Group recommended that American citizens and businesses should be able to own digital assets and use blockchain technologies for lawful purposes. It also suggested that entrepreneurs and software developers should have the liberty and regulatory certainty to “upgrade all sectors of our economy using these technologies.” Although a centralized intermediary or even a DAO deploying a DeFi application could build in restrictions on its use, an immutable, open-source protocol is available for anyone’s use in perpetuity, so requiring that it comply with financial surveillance measures is fruitless. She noted that open-source privacy software developers shouldn’t be responsible for the actions of third parties using their software, citing SEC Chair Paul Atkins’ recent call for a regulatory path for developers to “unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary.” In the Monday speech, Peirce also argued that regulators shouldn’t ask businesses to collect and report information on each other, as “doing so would deputize us to surveil our neighbors—a practice antithetical to a free society. Nor should we require an intermediary to step in the middle of peer-to-peer transactions.” Notably, the US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) formally scrapped a controversial crypto rule in July that would have mandated decentralized exchanges to comply with broker reporting obligations. The rule, originally proposed in November 2021 through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, aimed to close the “tax gap” by broadening the definition of “brokers” to include crypto exchanges and other intermediaries, while requiring DeFi platforms to report proceeds from digital asset transactions and detail user transaction information, including names and addresses. Tornado Cash Verdict To Set Key Precedent Commissioner Peirce’s remarks come ahead of the verdict of the Tornado Cash co-founder’s trial, which could set a negative precedent for open-source developers. Many industry leaders have argued that trying to hold software developers criminally liable for how third parties use their code will set a terrible precedent and freeze technological innovation in the US. For context, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash in August 2022 for “failing to impose effective controls” to prevent malicious actors from laundering funds through the protocol, including $455 million by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Following the sanctions, the protocol’s co-founder, Roman Storm, was detained in Washington in 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm pleaded not guilty to all charges and was freed on a $2 million bond to await his three-week trial, which started on July 14. If convicted, he could face up to 45 years in prison.",Crypto News|Crypto Privacy|crypto regulation|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|Hester Peirce|open-source developers|Roman Storm|SEC commissioner|SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce|Tornado Cash|US SEC,EN,1,u security exchange commission sec commissioner hester peirce called protection crypto privacy right development ahead crucial verdict tornado cash trial defense crypto privacy developer monday sec commissioner hester peirce defended crypto privacy sector affirming u authority welcome technology safeguard individual right digital asset science blockchain conference commissioner stated lawmaker regulator must take concrete step protect individual ability transact privately develop privacy software without fear prosecution peirce highlighted recent president working group recommended american citizen business able digital asset use blockchain technology lawful purpose also suggested entrepreneur software developer liberty regulatory certainty upgrade sector economy using although centralized intermediary even dao deploying defi application could build restriction use immutable protocol available anyone use perpetuity requiring comply financial surveillance measure fruitless noted privacy software developer responsible action third party using software citing sec chair paul atkins recent call regulatory path developer unleash software system require operation central monday speech peirce also argued regulator ask business collect report information would deputize u surveil practice antithetical free society require intermediary step middle notably u department treasury internal revenue service irs formally scrapped controversial crypto rule july would mandated decentralized exchange comply broker reporting obligation rule originally proposed november infrastructure investment job act aimed close tax gap broadening definition broker include crypto exchange intermediary requiring defi platform report proceeds digital asset transaction detail user transaction information including name address tornado cash verdict set key precedent commissioner peirce remark come ahead verdict tornado cash trial could set negative precedent developer many industry leader argued trying hold software developer criminally liable third party use code set terrible precedent freeze technological innovation u context u department treasury office foreign asset control ofac sanctioned crypto mixer tornado cash august failing impose effective control prevent malicious actor laundering fund protocol including million north korea lazarus group following sanction protocol roman storm detained washington charged conspiracy commit money laundering conspiracy commit sanction violation conspiracy operate unlicensed business storm pleaded guilty charge freed million bond await trial started july convicted could face year prison,0.113,0.693,0.194,0.9632,1

2025-08-06 04:00:43,49617595,1754452843,"Cardano to $5? Solana, XRP Traders Rotate Into MAGACOIN FINANCE","As major altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and XRP continue to consolidate near key technical levels, a shift is quietly happening beneath the surface. Traders and analysts alike are watching closely—but not just for a breakout in the usual names. Increasingly, smart money is rotating into lesser-known but high-conviction plays, including a decentralized political memecoin that’s quickly becoming one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With long-term optimism intact for the majors, short-term capital is flowing into projects offering sharper upside and stronger community traction—especially those with built-in cultural appeal and strategic momentum. Cardano’s $5 Ambition Gains Ground—but Momentum Is Slow Cardano has re-entered the spotlight after rebounding from recent lows, now gaining traction thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Its $71 million governance vote—backing enhancements like the Hydra scalability protocol and Acropolis node overhaul—signaled Cardano’s intent to accelerate decentralization. Developer activity is also ramping up, with the Midnight sidechain attracting serious attention ahead of the much-anticipated Glacier airdrop. Analysts say Cardano could test $0.81 resistance soon, and if it clears that threshold, a broader move toward the $5 zone may finally begin taking shape. XRP and Solana Still Bullish—But Risk Rotation Is Real XRP continues to show strength despite regulatory distractions. A brewing falling wedge pattern has technical traders on alert, with price targets pushing above $3.75 if breakout conditions are met. But Ripple’s ongoing licensing roadblocks and banking opposition have added uncertainty to the short-term outlook. Solana is showing clearer momentum. After recovering from a sharp dip, SOL now trades near resistance with analysts watching the $174 breakout level. Institutional interest remains strong, especially as Coinbase expands support for Solana-based DeFi and NFT tools. But even as XRP and SOL build solid bases, they’re starting to feel like slow burners. This has opened the door for capital to chase more agile plays—especially those with social buzz, ideological pull, and long-term infrastructure plans. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshine XRP This Quarter? While Cardano continues its slow march toward the $5 mark, and traders watch XRP and Solana build momentum without clear breakout signals, a new trend is emerging: capital rotation into high-upside altcoins with stronger cultural relevance and community-driven growth. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE—a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin—is gaining attention as the asset of choice for those seeking faster ROI. With sentiment cooling around slower-moving majors, MAGACOIN has become a focal point for traders projecting major upside potential in the next leg of the market cycle. Many early participants believe its unique positioning, combined with growing investor momentum, could support exponential returns—some projecting gains that rival or exceed 16,700%—as interest accelerates ahead of broader access and listings. Final Thoughts: W/hy Strategic Entry Matters Now The broader crypto market is once again showing signs of life—but the next leg of the bull cycle may reward agility over patience. While Cardano, XRP, and Solana remain foundational plays for long-term portfolios, early entrants into high-conviction narratives like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for upside before the rest of the market catches on.

2025-08-06 04:00:41,49617736,1754452841,"Top-Rated Cryptos in 2025: What Makes Cold Wallet, MNT, XMR & NEAR Stand Out?","With crypto markets moving fast as July comes to a close, many are focusing on top-rated cryptos in 2025 that provide more than hype. The current market trend is favoring choices that offer true use, actual utility, or potential growth. Instead of chasing trends, people are turning to assets showing long-term value. From cashback wallets changing fee structures to Layer 2s signaling a breakout, there’s real energy behind these names. This list of top-rated cryptos in 2025 includes projects addressing key pain points, like gas costs, privacy, and scaling, and shows why these assets are gaining attention in Q3. Cold Wallet, MNT, XMR, and NEAR each bring specific strengths, making it worth taking a closer look. Here’s why they’re considered top-rated cryptos in 2025. 1. Cold Wallet: Turning Every Fee Into a Reward Cold Wallet redefines how users interact with fees, changing typical charges into chances to earn. Gas fees, bridge costs, and swap charges are turned into cashback rewards through CWT, the core currency of the platform. Whether sending crypto, swapping, or bridging, users earn CWT. And the more CWT you keep in your wallet, the higher your cashback, starting at 10% and going up to 100%. No lock-ins or staking are needed, just hold and earn. This approach brings fairness to crypto use. The presale of CWT began at $0.00942 and follows a 150-stage pricing system where the price increases with each stage. Over $5.7 million has been raised so far, with more than 683 million coins sold. Currently in stage 16, Cold Wallet also gives referral bonuses: 10% for those who share and 5% for the ones they invite, all under a clear vesting plan. What really makes Cold Wallet stand out is not just rewards, but how it changes expectations. It’s built for real usage with zero gas overhead and a simple interface. In a space where most platforms take more than they give, Cold Wallet reverses the flow. That’s why it’s a top-rated crypto in 2025 for those who value practical use and fair returns. 2. MNT: Layer 2 Upgrade With Traction Mantle (MNT) isn’t just another token with price buzz; it’s showing progress with its UR beta utility layer, active until August 8. MNT aims to build a modular Ethereum Layer 2 that supports scalable apps and offers users relief from congestion and high costs. This cleaner setup is already pulling attention. Trading near $0.76 as of July 29, 2025, MNT recently dipped from its earlier high of $0.85. Still, technical indicators suggest a possible continued upward move, especially if it holds above the 200-day EMA. Analysts place year-end predictions between $0.79 and $1.38, based on development speed and adoption. With real structure, dependable tokenomics, and visible developer activity, MNT fits right into any list of top-rated cryptos in 2025. 3. XMR: A Consistent Name in Privacy-Focused Crypto Monero (XMR) continues to lead when it comes to privacy features. As of July 29, XMR is priced near $315 after reaching a recent high of $324. There were some concerns around mining power centralization with Qubic, but the quick release of version 0.18.4.1 “Fluorine Fermi” on July 25 helped address that and reaffirmed Monero’s commitment to decentralization. Outlooks for XMR remain positive. Conservative estimates predict an end-of-year target near $420, while some projections go as high as $670–$688 if the current pace continues. Monero stays relevant by focusing on privacy at a time when digital tracking is a rising concern. For those seeking real protection instead of just trend-driven DeFi plays, XMR still holds its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025. 4. NEAR: Technical Support and User Growth NEAR Protocol has kept steady performance across July with several price movements drawing attention. From July 24 to 25, NEAR jumped 6.9%, rising from $2.61 to $2.79, and has since corrected slightly to around $2.70. Despite the cooldown, trading signals still favor accumulation and a possible breakout. NEAR keeps building tools and attracting outside support, making it one of the few projects with both retail and institutional interest. Forecasts for August suggest a climb to $3.12–$3.27, and extended projections stretch toward $5.22 by 2026 if momentum continues. With new features rolling out and usage growing, NEAR earns its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025 for those chasing stable growth. Final Thoughts When evaluating top-rated cryptos in 2025, Cold Wallet stands out for turning routine fees into benefits and offering a smoother experience with fair rewards. MNT is proving itself through ongoing network upgrades and staying above key technical support levels. XMR remains unmatched for privacy, backed by strong community action and consistent price action. NEAR shows strength in both price structure and user adoption. Each of these picks has proven itself beyond short-term hype. They offer tools, functions, or structures that align with what today’s crypto user wants. If you’re mapping out your strategy, include these four in your watchlist of top-rated cryptos in 2025 . Not only are they making moves now, but their setups suggest they could still deliver much more ahead.

2025-08-06 04:00:35,49617735,1754452835,Traders Choose BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Entry Over TRX’s $0.50 Watch & DOGE Rally: Here’s How to Experience Live BDAG Trading!,"In crypto, timing can be crucial, but direct access often gives the real advantage. Dogecoin is climbing higher after bouncing strongly from a proven support zone, showing signs of renewed energy. Tron is also gathering attention as it trades above key levels and builds pressure near $0.50. Both show positive setups on the charts, but BlockDAG (BDAG) takes things to another level. Instead of waiting for an exchange listing, it offers a fully functional trading simulator now. Its live Dashboard V4 lets users interact with real-time BDAG/USD pricing, BUY and SELL panels, and instant wallet balance updates. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG delivers something rare: hands-on experience before public launch, making it one of the few presales that feels alive and active. Tron TRX Breakout Watch Nears as Bulls Target $0.50 Tron is pushing toward the $0.50 mark, drawing strong attention to a potential breakout move. With over 50% of all USDT currently moving through the Tron network, its role in handling stablecoins continues to strengthen, adding weight to its long-term value. Price action shows TRX holding above critical supports with steady trading volume supporting its climb. Technical signals are leaning bullish, and traders are adding Tron to their breakout watch lists as pressure builds. A clean close above $0.50 could mark the start of a stronger upward trend, supported by real network usage and growing confidence in its infrastructure. Dogecoin DOGE Rally Gains Strength as Key Level Holds Dogecoin is regaining bullish momentum after reclaiming a zone that has historically sparked major rallies. The bounce from around $0.22, combined with noticeable accumulation from larger holders, suggests building upward pressure. A possible golden cross is forming, with the 50-day moving average approaching a crossover above the 200-day—a classic sign of trend strength. If Dogecoin maintains this pace and secures $0.26 as firm support, analysts see potential for a run toward $0.46 or beyond. BlockDAG Turns Presale into a Full Trading Experience Before Launch Most early-stage projects only offer a promise: you buy early and wait. BlockDAG changes this approach completely by letting users experience a working trading environment long before exchange listings go live. Its Dashboard V4 is more than a preview; it simulates real market conditions with active tools. Inside the dashboard, users can open trades through functional BUY and SELL buttons, track live BDAG/USD charts, view an up-to-date order book, and see their wallets adjust instantly after each trade. This setup removes the usual guesswork of presales and replaces it with practical use. It allows participants to explore market trends, price shifts, and trade behavior firsthand, making the experience interactive instead of static. BlockDAG’s growth numbers highlight its strong traction. It has already raised $362.5 million, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, showing a 2,660% ROI from the first batch. But the real game-changer is the GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer, where, until August 11, buyers can access BDAG at only $0.0016. Based on the listing price of $0.05, this limited price could deliver 3,025% returns. What makes this opportunity stand out is not only the low entry point but also the ability to use a live trading setup before launch day. It builds trust and confidence, letting users practice and prepare ahead of time while securing their position before prices return to normal after August 11. For anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG sets a new standard, combining early access pricing with real-time utility that no other presale is offering. Which Is the Best Crypto to Invest In Now? Tron’s chart structure is showing pressure toward a breakout, and Dogecoin is rebuilding its rally momentum. But both depend on future price confirmations to prove their setups. BlockDAG offers something different: it gives users full access to live trading tools today, before listings go live. With real-time price tracking, functional trade execution, and instant wallet updates, BlockDAG delivers real utility now. For those choosing where to put their focus in this market, this early, hands-on experience sets BlockDAG apart as the best crypto to invest in now, combining active engagement with massive early access potential.

2025-08-06 04:00:27,49617475,1754452827,Binance Inflows A Leading Indicator For Altcoins? Analyst Explains How,"A quant has explained how altcoin inflows into cryptocurrency exchange Binance might act as a leading indicator for the market. Spikes In Binance Altcoin Inflows Tend To Precede Corrections In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend in the altcoin exchange inflows going to Binance. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Inflow Transaction Count,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of deposit transactions that investors are making to a given centralized exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Buyers Aren’t Selling: $118,000+ Supply Remains Firm Below is a chart for the indicator that shows the trend in the altcoin deposits occurring on the various exchanges. As is visible in the graph, the altcoin Exchange Inflow Transaction Count peaked on all exchanges right before both the 2024 market tops, implying that deposit activity intensified on the platforms. Generally, investors transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to sell, so spikes in exchange inflows can lead into bearish price action. This appears to be what happened in these two instances. Interestingly, during the latest market drawdown that has occurred over the past few days, inflows on only one exchange have seen a spike: Binance. There have also been other instances in the past where this pattern developed. “Spikes in Binance inflows (represented by the purple area) frequently precede downward price movements or market corrections,” notes the analyst. The quant has also explained that Binance is not only the largest exchange in the sector in terms of trading volume, but also a hub for altcoin activity from both retail and institutional entities. As such, investor behavior on the platform can be quite relevant for the wider market. Speaking of alts, CryptoQuant has shared a few new indicators that can be used to track smart money. One of these is the Average Order Size, which differentiates between futures buy orders by their scale. The above chart shows the indicator’s data for Hyperliquid (HYPE). It would appear that whale-sized buy orders appeared when the altcoin was trading around $11 earlier in the year. Since then, its price has climbed to $39. Related Reading: Bitcoin Neutral Sentiment Didn’t Last Long: Investors Already Greedy Again Another indicator is the Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency. This one is the opposite: it points out periods of elevated activity from the small hands. From this graph, it’s apparent that overheated periods of retail interest coincided with price highs in Gala (GALA). ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, down more than 4% over the past week.

2025-08-06 03:50:12,49617054,1754452212,Urgent Alert: China Warns Against Foreign Firms Collecting Iris Information via Crypto Tokens,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: China Warns Against Foreign Firms Collecting Iris Information via Crypto Tokens In the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, a crucial warning has emerged from an unexpected corner. China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) recently issued a stark alert, urging the public to exercise extreme caution. The warning highlights a concerning trend: foreign companies are reportedly attempting to collect sensitive iris information from users, dangling the enticing bait of crypto tokens . Why is China’s Ministry of State Security Issuing This Warning? On August 6, the MSS utilized its official WeChat channel to share this significant advisory. They did not name the specific overseas company involved, maintaining a focus on the broader threat. The core concern revolves around the surreptitious transfer of user biometric data, particularly iris scans, under the guise of distributing digital currencies. The MSS emphasized that such activities pose a direct threat. This isn’t just about individual privacy; it extends to the broader landscape of data security and even national security. When sensitive biometric identifiers like iris scans are compromised, the implications can be profound and far-reaching. Understanding the Threat: What is Iris Information and Why is it Valuable? Your iris is the colored part of your eye, containing a unique pattern that remains stable throughout your life. This makes it an incredibly reliable form of biometric identification, often considered more secure than fingerprints or facial recognition. Uniqueness: Each person’s iris pattern is distinct. Stability: Unlike fingerprints that can be altered, iris patterns remain constant. Irreversibility: Once compromised, you cannot change your iris pattern, unlike a password. Because of these characteristics, iris information is highly coveted by malicious actors. It can be used for identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, or even to create digital clones of individuals. The MSS’s warning underscores the severe risks associated with its unauthorized collection, especially when lured by incentives like crypto tokens . How Do Crypto Tokens Act as Bait for Personal Data? The allure of free or easily obtainable digital assets, such as crypto tokens , can be powerful. Many companies use token issuance, often through airdrops or sign-up bonuses, to attract new users and build their communities. However, this seemingly generous offer can sometimes hide a darker agenda. In this specific case, the MSS suggests that these foreign entities are using token distribution as a ‘bait’ to compel users to provide their biometric data. Users might be asked to scan their iris as part of a ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) process, or as a requirement to receive certain tokens or participate in a new project. Unwittingly, individuals might be trading their invaluable personal data for a speculative digital asset. This tactic highlights a growing concern in the cryptocurrency space: the intersection of digital finance and data security . As more innovative projects emerge, users must remain vigilant about the information they share, particularly highly sensitive biometric identifiers. Protecting Your Personal Data: Actionable Insights The warning from China’s Ministry of State Security serves as a global reminder about the importance of safeguarding your personal data . Here are some actionable steps you can take: Be Skeptical of Freebies: If an offer of crypto tokens seems too good to be true, especially if it requires providing sensitive biometric data, it likely is. Read Terms and Conditions: Always thoroughly review the privacy policies and terms of service before signing up for any new platform or service, particularly those involving digital assets. Understand what data they collect and why. Verify Company Legitimacy: Research the company behind the token issuance. Look for a clear history, reputable founders, and transparent operations. A lack of transparency is a major red flag. Understand Data Risks: Recognize that biometric data, once compromised, cannot be easily changed. Treat your iris information and other unique identifiers with the utmost care. This vigilance is crucial not just for individuals but also for national security, as aggregated biometric data could be exploited for various nefarious purposes. The Broader Implications for Data Security and National Security The MSS’s warning underscores a critical aspect of modern cybersecurity: the escalating value of biometric data. For governments, the collection of such sensitive information by foreign entities raises profound national security concerns. It could potentially lead to: Espionage: Identifying and tracking individuals of interest. Cyberattacks: Using stolen identities to gain access to critical infrastructure. Surveillance: Building comprehensive databases of citizens. While the specific foreign company remains unnamed, the advisory from China’s Ministry of State Security clearly signals a heightened awareness and concern within the Chinese government regarding digital asset activities that could undermine national interests and compromise citizen safety. This incident serves as a stark reminder that the digital frontier, while offering immense opportunities, also harbors significant risks that demand constant vigilance and robust protective measures. Ultimately, this warning is a call to action for everyone engaging with digital currencies. Your personal data is a valuable asset, far more so than any speculative crypto tokens . Protecting your iris information and other biometric data is paramount in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

2025-08-06 03:40:10,49616684,1754451610,"SOL Strategies’ Remarkable 396,717 SOL Holdings Mark Strong July Growth","BitcoinWorld SOL Strategies’ Remarkable 396,717 SOL Holdings Mark Strong July Growth Are you following the latest developments in the Solana ecosystem? Toronto-based SOL Strategies recently made headlines with its July performance, reporting a significant surge in its digital asset portfolio. This news offers a fascinating glimpse into the operational success within the blockchain space, especially for those keen on crypto investments . What are SOL Strategies’ Impressive July Holdings? SOL Strategies , a prominent player in the Solana ecosystem, announced a remarkable month-over-month increase in its operations. According to a press release distributed via Newsfile, the company’s financial snapshot for July revealed substantial growth. This growth highlights the increasing interest and activity surrounding the Solana blockchain. Key figures from their July report include: 396,717 SOL held: This substantial amount of Solana’s native token represents a significant portion of their liquid assets. 26,440 JitoSOL held: JitoSOL is a liquid staking token on Solana, indicating SOL Strategies’ engagement with advanced DeFi strategies. 15% month-over-month increase in validator revenue: This impressive jump in earnings underscores their efficient and profitable staking operations. 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation: This figure demonstrates the trust placed in SOL Strategies by other SOL holders, who delegate their tokens to the company for staking purposes. These figures collectively paint a picture of a thriving entity within the Solana landscape, actively contributing to and benefiting from the network’s growth. The substantial SOL holdings reflect a strong commitment to the ecosystem. How Does Validator Revenue Boost Crypto Investments? The concept of validator revenue is central to understanding how companies like SOL Strategies generate income within proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana. Validators are crucial nodes that secure the network by verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. For this vital work, they earn rewards, often in the native cryptocurrency of the network. SOL Strategies’ reported 15% increase in validator revenue for July is a strong indicator of their operational efficiency and the health of the Solana network itself. Higher revenue suggests more successful block validation, potentially more delegated SOL, and overall robust network activity. For investors considering crypto investments , a company consistently growing its validator revenue demonstrates a stable and profitable business model in the volatile crypto market. Why Are SOL Holdings and Assets Under Delegation Significant? The reported SOL holdings of 396,717 SOL directly impact SOL Strategies’ influence and potential within the Solana ecosystem. Holding a large amount of the native token provides liquidity and flexibility for various operations, from staking to participating in governance. Furthermore, the 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation is equally, if not more, significant. Assets under delegation (AUD) represent the total amount of tokens that other Solana holders have entrusted to SOL Strategies’ validators. This delegation mechanism is fundamental to the security and decentralization of proof-of-stake networks. A large AUD figure means: Increased Network Security: More delegated SOL strengthens the network’s consensus mechanism. Enhanced Influence: Validators with more delegated SOL have a greater chance of being selected to validate blocks, leading to more rewards. Community Trust: A high AUD indicates strong trust from the Solana community in SOL Strategies’ reliability and performance. Therefore, these figures not only highlight SOL Strategies’ financial strength but also its crucial role in the broader Solana network’s health and development. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solana and Crypto Investments? The continued growth of entities like SOL Strategies provides a positive outlook for the Solana blockchain. As more institutional players and specialized companies commit significant resources to validating and participating in the network, it reinforces Solana’s position as a robust and scalable platform. This stability and growth can attract further development, dApps, and users, creating a positive feedback loop. For individuals interested in crypto investments , observing the performance of professional validators like SOL Strategies can offer valuable insights. Their success indicates not just individual company strength but also the underlying potential of the Solana ecosystem as a whole. It underscores the viability of staking as a passive income strategy within the crypto space, provided it’s done through reputable and high-performing entities. In conclusion, SOL Strategies’ impressive July report, showcasing substantial SOL holdings and a significant boost in validator revenue , paints a compelling picture of growth and stability within the Solana ecosystem. Their commitment to the network, demonstrated through their vast assets under delegation, solidifies their position as a key player. This performance not only highlights their operational excellence but also serves as a positive indicator for the broader landscape of crypto investments , particularly for those eyeing the promising future of Solana.

This move by Binance is part of its ongoing effort to maintain a high-quality trading environment for its extensive user base. Why Do Crypto Exchanges Delist Spot Trading Pairs? You might be wondering why a prominent crypto exchange like Binance decides to delist certain assets or pairs. Several factors typically influence such decisions, all aimed at protecting users and ensuring market integrity. Common reasons include: Low Liquidity: Pairs with insufficient trading volume can lead to poor price discovery and difficulty in executing trades. Project Performance: If a project’s development or community engagement falters, its associated trading pairs may be reviewed. Regulatory Compliance: Evolving regulations can sometimes necessitate the removal of certain assets or pairs. User Safety: Protecting users from scams or projects that no longer meet high standards is paramount. While Binance did not specify the exact reasons for the NKN/BTC and STX/BNB delisting in its announcement, these general criteria often apply. It underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. What Actions Should Traders Take Before the Deadline? For those holding NKN or STX, or actively trading these spot trading pairs , prompt action is essential. Binance encourages users to manage their positions effectively before the delisting date. Here’s what you should consider: Convert or Trade: If you hold NKN or STX, you can convert them to other cryptocurrencies available on Binance, or trade them against other active pairs if available. Withdraw: Alternatively, you can withdraw your NKN or STX tokens to an external wallet or another exchange that supports them. Monitor Announcements: Always keep an eye on official Binance announcements for any further updates or clarifications regarding the delisting process. Remember, once the delisting takes effect, you will no longer be able to trade these specific pairs on Binance’s spot market. Planning ahead can help you avoid any potential inconveniences. Broader Implications of a Binance Delisting for Your Portfolio A Binance delisting , even of specific spot trading pairs like NKN/BTC and STX/BNB , can send ripples through the market. While not always indicative of a project’s complete failure, it often leads to increased selling pressure for the affected assets on the delisting exchange. This highlights the importance of diversifying your portfolio and staying informed about the health and activity of the projects you invest in. For any crypto investor, understanding exchange policies and regularly reviewing your holdings against such announcements is a key part of risk management. It reinforces the need for due diligence and proactive portfolio management in the fast-paced world of digital assets. The upcoming Binance delisting of NKN/BTC and STX/BNB spot trading pairs serves as a timely reminder for all crypto participants. It emphasizes the importance of staying updated with announcements from your chosen crypto exchange and taking timely action to manage your assets. By understanding the reasons behind such decisions and preparing accordingly, you can navigate the evolving crypto landscape with greater confidence. Ensure your portfolio remains agile and responsive to market changes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when a crypto exchange delists a trading pair?

2025-08-06 03:25:56,49616111,1754450756,Urgent: Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Reveals Critical Market Shifts,"BitcoinWorld Urgent: Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Reveals Critical Market Shifts Understanding the intricate dynamics of the cryptocurrency market is crucial for any participant. One significant indicator of market health and sentiment is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This process, often misunderstood, reveals massive shifts in trader positions and can signal impending volatility or corrections. Over the last 24 hours, we’ve witnessed substantial liquidation events across major digital assets, offering critical insights into current market trends. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what futures liquidation means. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. When a trader’s position, whether ‘long’ (betting on price increase) or ‘short’ (betting on price decrease), falls below a certain margin requirement, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This forced closure is called liquidation. It’s a mechanism to manage risk, but it can also amplify market moves, creating cascading effects. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Liquidation Data The past 24 hours have shown significant activity in the crypto perpetual futures market. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $107.83 million in ETH positions were liquidated. Notably, 68.95% of these were ‘long’ positions. This indicates that a majority of traders betting on ETH’s price increase faced forced closures, suggesting a recent downward price movement or a sudden dip caught many off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin saw $56.59 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of ‘long’ positions at 82.67%. This strong bias towards long liquidations for BTC further emphasizes a prevailing bearish sentiment or sharp price corrections that impacted bullish traders. MYX: Interestingly, MYX recorded $15.60 million in liquidations, but here, ‘short’ positions accounted for 69.36%. This means traders who were betting on MYX’s price decrease were liquidated. This could point to a sudden upward price movement for MYX, contrasting with the general trend seen in ETH and BTC. These figures provide a snapshot of the intense pressure and rapid shifts occurring in the market. What Do These Liquidation Trends Tell Us About Crypto Market Analysis? Understanding these liquidation patterns is vital for accurate crypto market analysis . The high percentage of long liquidations for ETH and BTC suggests that these assets experienced notable price declines over the 24-hour period, catching many bullish traders by surprise. Such events often lead to increased selling pressure as liquidated positions add to the supply, potentially causing further price drops. Conversely, the significant short liquidation for MYX indicates an unexpected upward price surge, forcing bearish traders to close their positions. These contrasting movements highlight the diverse and sometimes unpredictable nature of individual altcoins compared to market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traders must always consider these underlying dynamics. Actionable Trading Insights from Recent Volatility What actionable trading insights can we glean from this data? Firstly, the prevalence of long liquidations for major assets like ETH and BTC underscores the importance of robust risk management. Over-leveraging in a volatile market can quickly lead to devastating losses. Secondly, the contrasting MYX data reminds us that not all assets move in lockstep. Diversification and specific research into individual altcoins are crucial. Always use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully. This data serves as a powerful reminder that while perpetual futures offer high leverage, they also come with amplified risks. Staying informed about these liquidation events can help traders anticipate potential price movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. The recent 24-hour market volatility , marked by significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation across ETH, BTC, and MYX, serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent risks and opportunities. These liquidations are not just numbers; they represent substantial capital shifts and illustrate the rapid changes in trader sentiment. By closely monitoring these metrics, market participants gain a deeper understanding of underlying pressures and can make more informed decisions. Always prioritize risk management and continuous learning in this dynamic space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, offering high leverage. 2. What causes a perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position falls below the required margin level, leading the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses. This usually happens due to adverse price movements against the trader’s position. 3. What does a high percentage of “long” liquidations mean? A high percentage of “long” liquidations indicates that many traders who bet on a price increase (going long) were forced to close their positions, typically because the asset’s price decreased significantly. 4. How can traders use liquidation data? Traders can use liquidation data to gauge market sentiment, identify potential support or resistance levels, and understand areas of high leverage that might lead to further volatility or cascading liquidations. It highlights where significant capital is being lost or gained. 5. Is trading crypto perpetual futures risky? Yes, trading crypto perpetual futures is highly risky due to the leverage involved. While leverage can amplify gains, it can also significantly amplify losses, leading to rapid liquidations if the market moves against your position.

2025-08-06 03:02:25,49615215,1754449345,MYX Token Price Plunges: Shocking 58% Drop After Unlock & Hack VC Sell-Off,"BitcoinWorld MYX Token Price Plunges: Shocking 58% Drop After Unlock & Hack VC Sell-Off The cryptocurrency market often delivers unexpected turns, and recent events surrounding the MYX token price are a prime example. Investors witnessed a significant downturn today as the MYX token experienced a sharp 58% drop. This dramatic fall coincided directly with a scheduled token unlock, sparking immediate questions about market dynamics and investor behavior. What Triggered the Dramatic MYX Token Unlock Impact? On-chain analysis reveals that the considerable decline in the MYX token price was not random. It directly followed a pre-scheduled token unlock event. Token unlocks release previously restricted tokens into the circulating supply, which can increase selling pressure. In this case, a major investor, Hack VC, played a pivotal role. According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, Hack VC claimed a substantial amount of MYX tokens. Specifically, they received 1,279,890 MYX, valued at approximately $2.16 million at the time. This claim originated from an airdrop contract over a seven-hour period, setting the stage for the subsequent market reaction. Unpacking the Hack VC Sell-Off Following the token claim, Hack VC proceeded with a significant Hack VC sell-off . The firm executed two separate transactions to offload these newly acquired tokens onto the market. Such large-scale selling by a prominent investor can significantly influence a token’s price, especially if market liquidity is thin. Here’s a closer look at the impact of this specific event: Increased Supply: The release of 1.28 million MYX tokens from a locked state instantly increased the circulating supply. Investor Behavior: Hack VC’s decision to sell immediately after claiming suggests a strategy to realize profits or reduce exposure, contributing heavily to the downward pressure. Market Reaction: The sheer volume of the Hack VC sell-off overwhelmed buying demand, leading to the rapid price depreciation of the MYX token. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility After Token Unlocks The incident with MYX highlights a common pattern in the crypto space: the heightened crypto market volatility around token unlock events. When large tranches of tokens held by early investors or project teams become liquid, there’s an inherent risk of increased selling pressure. This can lead to sharp price corrections, even for otherwise promising projects. Understanding the token unlock impact is crucial for any crypto investor. These events are often publicly scheduled, allowing market participants to anticipate potential supply increases. However, the exact timing and scale of selling activity by specific entities, like the recent Hack VC sell-off , can be unpredictable and cause significant price swings. What Does This Mean for MYX Token Holders? For current holders of the MYX token , such a sharp decline can be concerning. It underscores the importance of thorough research into a project’s tokenomics, including its vesting schedules and unlock dates. While some projects mitigate the impact of unlocks with buybacks or strong development news, others may experience significant price discovery downwards. Investors should consider these points: Risk Assessment: Always evaluate the risks associated with token unlocks. Diversification: Avoid over-exposure to any single asset, especially those with significant upcoming unlocks. Long-Term View: For long-term investors, short-term volatility might present buying opportunities, but careful due diligence is paramount. The MYX token’s recent performance serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unforgiving nature of the digital asset market. In conclusion, the dramatic fall in MYX token price following its token unlock and the substantial Hack VC sell-off provides a valuable case study in the complexities of crypto market dynamics. It reinforces the critical need for investors to stay informed about tokenomics, vesting schedules, and the potential for increased crypto market volatility around such events. Understanding the immediate and long-term token unlock impact is key to navigating these challenging waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the MYX token price to drop so sharply? The MYX token price dropped significantly due to a large volume of tokens being unlocked and subsequently sold by a major investor, Hack VC, immediately after they claimed their tokens from an airdrop contract. What is a token unlock? A token unlock is a scheduled event where previously locked cryptocurrency tokens, often held by early investors, team members, or advisors, become available for trading. This can increase the circulating supply and potentially lead to selling pressure. Who is Hack VC and what was their role in the MYX token event? Hack VC is an investor in MYX Finance. They claimed 1,279,890 MYX tokens (worth approximately $2.16 million) from an airdrop contract and then sold them in two separate transactions, directly contributing to the MYX token price decline. Is it common for crypto prices to fall after a token unlock? Yes, it is relatively common for cryptocurrency prices to experience downward pressure or increased volatility after a token unlock, especially if large amounts of tokens are released and subsequently sold by major holders. How can investors prepare for potential token unlock impact? Investors can prepare by researching a project’s tokenomics, understanding its vesting schedule and unlock dates, and assessing the potential supply increase. Diversifying portfolios and practicing risk management are also crucial strategies. Did you find this analysis insightful?

2025-08-06 03:00:41,49615172,1754449241,XRP ETF Approval Triggers XRP and ETH Price Breakout Forecasts,"The crypto market is on the move again. The recent approval of the XRP ETF structure by the SEC has triggered fresh optimism among traders. XRP quickly gained momentum, with Ethereum following closely behind. Both are now being watched for breakout price action as ETF-driven demand picks up. Investors see this as a key turning point. The SEC’s greenlight on in-kind crypto ETF redemptions is fueling confidence that the altcoin market is finally entering a new phase of legitimacy. As a result, capital is rotating faster than ever, with early winners already starting to form. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered the mix as part of this rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Fresh Capital as ETF Hype Reshapes the Market As XRP gains strength from ETF approval and ETH picks up bullish momentum, traders are expanding their search beyond the top ten. Many are now moving into emerging presale tokens that carry real upside. One name catching serious attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its presale underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing in traders who believe this cycle still has room for smaller tokens to explode. What stands out is how quickly funds are flowing in—not just from retail wallets but also from mid-sized holders moving capital out of XRP and Ethereum. The token’s appeal lies in more than just hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean token model, clear branding, and a cultural edge that taps into real-world sentiment. Its political theme resonates with a wide online community, giving it the viral spark that earlier meme tokens needed to catch fire. Based on current inflows and presale growth, some investors believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver gains of up to 37x. While no token is guaranteed to hit those heights, the early demand suggests it’s becoming one of the stronger contenders in this ETF-fueled rotation. XRP and ETH Set the Stage—But Newcomers Could Ride the Wave Higher XRP’s ETF support is helping rewrite the rules for altcoin legitimacy. Ethereum is positioned to benefit next, with many expecting a spillover effect as institutions embrace a wider range of assets. But while these giants lead the headlines, smart traders are already looking at the next layer down. The presale space is heating up again, and well-positioned tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are standing out. The key isn’t just hype—it’s timing. With ETF narratives dominating, tokens that align with broader trends have a better chance of rapid growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks that box with strong community roots and growing market visibility. Conclusion: The Window for Early Movers Is Open XRP and ETH are reigniting the altcoin cycle thanks to ETF approval momentum. As capital floods back into the market, traders are not only holding the old names—they’re rotating into new ones with greater upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a standout in that shift. Its presale is gaining speed as more investors recognize the potential for strong returns in a fast-changing market. For those paying attention, the opportunity to enter early is still there—but maybe not for long.

2025-08-06 03:00:39,49615117,1754449239,Is Ethereum Gearing Up for a Major Move? Analysts Split on What’s Next,"Ethereum’s price has experienced moderate declines over the past week, dropping around 5% after a period of notable gains in previous months. At the time of writing, ETH is trading near $3,633, fluctuating between the $3,500 and $3,700 range over the past day. This price movement follows a broader market cooling, with many traders engaging in profit-taking after Ethereum’s earlier upward trend. Recent on-chain and derivatives market data suggest that Ethereum may be heading into a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Battles Key Levels – Will Buyers Step Back In? Derivatives Market Data Signals Selling Pressure CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared an outlook indicating increased selling pressure and potential short-term weakness in the ETH futures market. The analyst highlighted that despite several attempts to breach the $4,000 resistance level, Ethereum has yet to break through, indicating possible market hesitancy at current levels. Darkfost emphasized that the behavior of the futures market has shifted notably over the past few weeks. According to data from Binance, Ethereum’s taker buy/sell ratio has dropped to 0.87, one of the lowest levels observed this year. A ratio below 1 typically indicates that sell orders are dominating over buy orders, suggesting that traders are either closing long positions or opening shorts. The analyst noted that this trend began around July 18 and has remained mostly negative since then, limiting upward momentum. Additionally, the seven-day and 30-day simple moving averages (SMAs) have started to trend downward, which could be a sign of slowing market momentum. Binance continues to hold the largest share of ETH futures open interest among exchanges, making sentiment on this platform particularly influential. With sellers currently exerting more control, the data suggests a potential continuation of this consolidation phase until buying activity strengthens. Mixed Views on Ethereum’s Longer-Term Outlook While near-term market data points to a challenging period for Ethereum, some analysts maintain a positive longer-term outlook. A recent post by Titan of Crypto, a well-followed market commentator on X, projected a potential price target of $8,000. According to Titan of Crypto, Ethereum’s price structure is forming a large monthly triangle pattern that could eventually lead to a breakout, opening the way toward a significant rally. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t What It Seems — Here’s What’s Really Driving It This bullish view aligns with other optimistic forecasts on X, where traders speculate that Ethereum could revisit or surpass its previous all-time highs once key resistance levels are cleared and broader market demand returns. $ETH below $4,000 is a steal.

2025-08-06 03:00:34,49615121,1754449234,Crypto Could Be Shielded By Trump’s Planned Executive Order Against Bank Discrimination,"US President Donald Trump is moving ahead with a plan to target banks that cut off customers over politics or crypto. His team is expected to issue an executive order within days. According to a report from The Independent, the order will push regulators to dig into possible breaches of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust rules, and consumer protection laws. It could hit banks with hefty fines, consent decrees, or other penalties. Background Of Banking And Crypto Clash Industry voices say crypto firms have long felt frozen out by big banks. They point to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” under the Biden years, which they claim led to sudden account closures without clear reasons. BREAKING: Trump to prepare executive order that punishes banks that discriminate against conservatives, according to Wall Street Journal report. — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) August 5, 2025 In 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said JPMorgan Chase warned it would shut accounts tied to main crypto income. In November the following year, Elon Musk said as many as 30 tech entrepreneurs lost bank access under that policy. Banks have since pushed back. They say decisions were about anti-money laundering rules. They add that managing reputational risk lets them guard against fraud and legal trouble. Trump To End Banks’ ‘Reputational Risk’ Shield According to The Wall Street Journal , the order will tell federal bank overseers to look for violations of key laws. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act bans discrimination in lending. Antitrust laws keep competition fair. Consumer protection statutes shield against unfair practices. If banks are found at fault, they face monetary penalties or binding consent orders. The move aims to stop banks from using compliance as an excuse for political bias. It could also strip away so-called reputational risk guidelines that critics blame for “debanking.” Penalties And Enforcement Based on a report by Reuters , the order could be in force as early as this week. It will empower regulators to impose fines or other disciplinary steps. It also asks the Small Business Administration to review banks that guarantee SBA loans. That means any lenders accused of cutting ties with certain customers may face fresh scrutiny. Calls for comment to the White House went unanswered, according to Reuters. The Politics Of Banking Cuts Trump has been outspoken about big banks. In January, he accused the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America of turning away conservative clients. The banks denied the claims. At the same time, Republican politicians and state officials have slammed “woke capitalism,” saying banks are cutting off gun makers, fossil fuel firms, and others that lean right. Those voices helped shape the executive order’s focus.

2025-08-05 17:00:28,49592194,1754413228,BlockDAG Holders Experience Live BDAG Trading with Dashboard V4! ETH Climbs on $3B Buy While FET Slips,"This week’s crypto market is showing three very different stories playing out. Fetch.ai’s FET struggles to hold support after dipping below $0.66, leaving traders eyeing $0.49 as a possible next stop. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) gets a lift from BitMine’s massive $3 billion buying spree, giving its price rally a fresh jolt of energy. And then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG) , which just rolled out its Trading Dashboard V4. Unlike other presales that offer nothing but numbers on a page, this one puts participants inside a live trading environment before launch. With order books, price charts, and market depth already active, BDAG feels closer to a listed asset than an early-stage project. FET Price Outlook Turns Negative After Key Support Break FET’s recent drop below $0.66 has put pressure on the chart, breaking out of a six-month triangle pattern and extending losses by more than 15% over the past week. Analysts now point to $0.56 and $0.49 as likely test zones if the decline continues. Some relief could still come from a long-term trendline dating back to 2022, which has acted as support in previous corrections. Wave analysis suggests this latest sell-off may be nearing its final stage, but holding above $0.60 is key. If that fails, deeper losses could set in before buyers return in force. Ethereum Price Rally Gains Steam on BitMine’s Aggressive Accumulation Ethereum is back in the spotlight after BitMine pushed its ETH holdings past $3 billion, buying over 208,000 additional coins to bring its total stash to 833,137 ETH. This aggressive accumulation helped ETH rally almost 6% to $3,730 before easing back to $3,654. Analysts suggest the next moves for ETH depend heavily on whether other large buyers keep following BitMine’s lead. Without that sustained demand, the current rally could stall near $3,940 resistance, leaving the $3,600–$3,300 range back in play. BlockDAG’s Trading Dashboard Brings Future-Day Trading to Presale Buyers BlockDAG is shaking up what a presale looks like with its newly launched Trading Dashboard V4, now live for all holders. The interface feels like a full exchange setup, complete with live BDAG/USD charts, order books that refresh in real time, market activity feeds, and active buy and sell panels that work 24/7. This means participants aren’t just watching numbers tick upward; they’re practicing the same actions they’ll take once BDAG lists publicly. With over $362.5 million already raised and 24.7 billion coins sold, the project is setting new records for early participation. The current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, but as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, anyone buying before August 11 can lock in a special $0.0016 price. Once the listing goes live at $0.05, that entry point offers a potential 3,025% return. Early supporters from Batch 1 have already seen 2,660% growth on their holdings, showing just how strong the climb has been. With the dashboard now letting people trade ahead of time, the transition to real market activity feels closer than ever. Missing this phase could mean losing one of the lowest-cost entries before BDAG moves toward its confirmed launch price. Which Coin Holds the Biggest Upside From Here? FET is still looking for a bottom, ETH’s rally is tied to big-money buyers, and other leading coins are swinging with the market’s mood. But BlockDAG is breaking the usual pattern. Its live trading dashboard, huge presale traction, and limited-time $0.0016 pricing are creating an opportunity few early-stage projects ever offer. With just days left before pricing climbs, those looking for exposure to BDAG’s 3,025% potential gains have a clear window to act before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release changes the game.

2025-08-05 17:00:12,49592061,1754413212,Russia Ukraine Truce: Crucial Talks Emerge on Trump’s Offer,"BitcoinWorld Russia Ukraine Truce: Crucial Talks Emerge on Trump’s Offer Significant geopolitical shifts are constantly reshaping our world, and recent reports suggest a potentially pivotal development in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. There is growing speculation about a possible Russia Ukraine truce , specifically an air truce, being considered by the Kremlin. This move is reportedly linked to an offer from former U.S. President Donald Trump, signaling a complex interplay of diplomacy and economic pressure. What’s Driving the Kremlin’s Consideration of a Kremlin Air Truce ? According to Walter Bloomberg on X, the Kremlin is reportedly weighing a potential air truce with Ukraine. This consideration is not just a diplomatic gesture; it is seen as a strategic effort to avoid the risk of secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions are punitive measures imposed by one country (like the U.S.) on entities from a third country that continue to do business with a sanctioned country. For Russia, facing an array of existing sanctions, the threat of additional restrictions is a significant concern, driving this potential move towards sanctions avoidance . Understanding the implications of these sanctions is crucial. They can severely impact a nation’s economy by limiting access to international financial systems and markets. Therefore, any opportunity for sanctions avoidance would be a high priority for Moscow. The Role of Donald Trump in a Potential Trump Peace Plan The reported offer from Donald Trump adds an intriguing layer to this developing situation. While the specifics of Trump’s proposal remain undisclosed, his history of engaging in high-stakes international negotiations is well-known. His involvement suggests a potential shift in the diplomatic landscape, aiming to de-escalate tensions. A Trump peace plan , even if limited to an air truce, could be a stepping stone towards broader discussions. This situation highlights the complex nature of international diplomacy, where external actors can play a significant role in influencing the trajectory of conflicts. Trump’s potential return to the political arena might be prompting Moscow to consider preemptive diplomatic maneuvers. Could This Lead to Broader Ukraine Peace Talks ? While an air truce is a specific and limited form of de-escalation, its consideration could open doors for more comprehensive Ukraine peace talks . A successful air truce might build a modicum of trust between the warring parties, which is essential for any meaningful negotiation. Such a development could signify a shift from military confrontation to diplomatic engagement. Potential Benefits: Reduced civilian casualties from aerial attacks. A pathway to broader ceasefire agreements. Easing of humanitarian crises in affected regions. Key Challenges: Establishing mutual trust and verifiable compliance. Addressing underlying political and territorial disputes. Navigating the complex interests of various international stakeholders.

2025-08-05 17:00:11,49592079,1754413211,Shiba Inu Team Member Reveals ‘Primary Challenge’ And ‘Top Priority’ Amid Market Uncertainty,"In the face of growing market uncertainty, a Shiba Inu developer, Kaal Dhairya, has spoken out on X about the project’s internal problem and the team’s top priorities. As SHIB begins August with a market dip, slipping further down the crypto rankings, and facing growing competition, Dhairya is drawing attention to the internal struggles holding the ecosystem back. Shiba Inu Primary Challenge Revealed According to Kaal Dhairya, the biggest issue holding Shiba Inu back is not the market, but what’s happening inside the community, highlighting the ongoing splits slowing down SHIB’s development and holding back its progress. He says rather than evaluating projects based on their potential benefits to Shibarium and SHIB holders, decision-makers often base their choices on personal opinions and bias. Related Reading: Spot Ethereum ETFs Set A New Record In July With $5.4 Billion Monthly Inflow Dhairya gave a past example to show how things used to be different. He mentioned how the K9 project thrived under the support and guidance of trusted community members like himself and another developer, Shytoshi Kusama. Back then, no one saw it as a scam or a quick cash grab, and the community supported it. But now, he says, even legitimate projects get caught in the crossfire of personal rivalries and distrust. Individuals who have already raised significant amounts of money from the SHIB community or built influence under changing identities often drive this tension. He added that while it is typical for projects to hire advisors or influencers to promote their tokens in return for payment, he believes the SHIB community should aim for something better. Dhairya emphasized the need for openness and honesty within the community regarding personal gains from promoting or advising a project as part of that higher standard. Top Priority: Building Unity And Community Governance With the market turning and the cryptocurrency dropping under the top 20 in the rankings, Dhairya clarified that the main priority now must be unity. Shiba Inu saw a 9% rise in July, but that momentum quickly faded. By early August, SHIB had dropped over 2%, falling from a high of $0.00001437 on July 28 to a low of $0.0000116 on August 2. The token has now dropped to the 22nd spot in the crypto rankings, with a market cap of $7.17 billion. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Reveals What Will Drive The XRP Price Value Instead of being divided by internal arguments, Dhairya wants the community to unite and tackle the external challenges, especially in light of SHIB’s recent price drop. These include rival projects that have pushed the cryptocurrency out of the top 10 and major web3 companies and crypto infrastructures that continue to overlook Shiba Inu. He also mentioned centralized exchanges that earn large profits from SHIB but do not show the community the respect it deserves. To face these outside forces, Dhairya stressed implementing practical decision-making tools, eliminating favoritism, and supporting projects that add actual value to the ecosystem. The developer also underscored the need to empower Shiba Inu’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as the future lies in building a fair, community-led system where every “Shibizen” has an equal voice. He further suggests a quad-token governance model and adherence to ethical guidelines, like the Great Canine Code, to keep leaders accountable and prevent misuse of power.

2025-08-05 17:00:06,49592886,1754413206,Pi Network Price Crashes To All-Time Low After Latest Announcement — Details,"The price of Pi Network’s native token, PI, has tumbled to its lowest level ever recorded, breaking below $0.4 before continuing its retrace to $0.35 at the time of writing. The crash comes just days after a controversial announcement from the Pi Network team, which may have intensified bearish sentiment across the community. PI Breaks Through Historical Lows As Downtrend Deepens The PI/USDT pair has now fallen beneath every key support level since its launch. As shown in the weekly chart, PI is trading under a sustained descending trendline and remains below all major Fibonacci resistance points. At the time of writing, the token is sitting just above $0.40, and price action is mounting with selling pressure to break lower, especially if broader altcoin dominance weakens further . This week’s candle marks a continuation of the steady decline that began in March, despite sporadic bullish spikes. This has allowed Pi to continue declining with every move and is now trading at its lowest price level since its launch. Interestingly, this crash came amidst a recent announcement by the Pi team. The Pi Network team published an announcement urging Pioneers to voluntarily lock up their PI tokens to boost their mining rates. According to the August 1 blog post, users can choose to lock up to 200% of their migrated balance and receive enhanced rewards for doing so. The post also explained the various ways to initiate the lockup via the Pi app and Pi Browser. Bleak Outlook Unless Strong Support Returns However, this move has done little to calm the storm, and Pi’s price continued its decline. The announcement’s timing may be flawed, particularly given the unaddressed concerns about migration delays and token liquidity. There’s the inability to trade or use much of the circulating supply, and now, locking tokens with no guaranteed future liquidity feels more like a sacrifice than a strategic decision. At the same time, liquidity is a major issue. There are limited trading options, as Pi is only available on a few centralized exchanges, but it’s not listed on major platforms like Binance or Coinbase. Also, there are a few mechanisms for real-world utility. Now that Pi is trading around $0.35, the downtrend has officially entered uncharted territory. Unless a strong support zone materializes quickly, Pi Network delivers a major ecosystem catalyst, or the inflow into the market returns, the current collapse may extend deeper. The lockup initiative, which was intended to encourage commitment and network growth, appears to have backfired among a user base already grappling with doubts about the project’s pace. As such, the Pi Network faces increasing pressure to deliver meaningful progress before the community’s confidence erodes even further. At the time of writing, Pi is trading at $0.352, down by 1.4% and 19.6% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.",Crypto News|Altcoin|binance|coinbase|Fibonacci Resistance level|pi|Pi Network|PIUSD|PIUSDT,EN,0,price pi network native token pi tumbled lowest level ever recorded breaking continuing retrace time writing crash come day controversial announcement pi network team may intensified bearish sentiment across community pi break historical low downtrend deepens pair fallen beneath every key support level since launch shown weekly chart pi trading sustained descending trendline remains major fibonacci resistance point time writing token sitting price action mounting selling pressure break lower especially broader altcoin dominance weakens week candle mark continuation steady decline began march despite sporadic bullish spike allowed pi continue declining every move trading lowest price level since launch interestingly crash came amidst recent announcement pi team pi network team published announcement urging pioneer voluntarily lock pi token boost mining rate according august blog post user choose lock migrated balance receive enhanced reward post also explained various way initiate lockup via pi app pi browser bleak outlook unless strong support return however move done little calm storm pi price continued decline announcement timing may flawed particularly given unaddressed concern migration delay token liquidity inability trade use much circulating supply locking token guaranteed future liquidity feel like sacrifice strategic decision time liquidity major issue limited trading option pi available centralized exchange listed major platform like binance coinbase also mechanism utility pi trading around downtrend officially entered uncharted territory unless strong support zone materializes quickly pi network delivers major ecosystem catalyst inflow market return current collapse may extend deeper lockup initiative intended encourage commitment network growth appears backfired among user base already grappling doubt project pace pi network face increasing pressure deliver meaningful progress community confidence erodes even time writing pi trading past hour seven day respectively,0.154,0.688,0.158,0.3617,1

2025-08-05 16:57:37,49591954,1754413057,David Bailey Aims to Advance Bitcoin with $200 Million Political Action Committee,"David Bailey plans to raise up to $200M for a Bitcoin-focused political action committee. PAC priorities include abolishing Bitcoin capital gains tax and promoting crypto education. Experts caution regulatory and legal challenges in using company funds for political causes. US President Donald Trump’s Bitcoin advisor and Bitcoin Magazine CEO, David Bailey, has announced plans to raise up to $200 million to create a political action committee (PAC). The PAC’s main task will be to promote initiatives related to Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Bailey emphasized his intention to use Nakamoto Holdings, his investment company specializing in managing Bitcoin reserves, to implement the initiative. He stated that the goal of the committee is not only to influence the political agenda but also to “position Bitcoin for the long term.” Bailey named reaching the $10-million price tag as a priority and invited the community to propose additional ideas. These include abolishing the capital gains tax on Bitcoin sales, protecting the right to independently store cryptocurrency, and introducing “crypto education” in schools. Some experts added their initiatives. Alex Gladstein, director of strategy at the Human Rights Foundation, suggested seeking protections for open-source software developers and proposed allowing foreign countries to repay US debts in Bitcoin. Investor Tuur Demeester emphasized the need to return to a full-reserve banking system. At the same time, BTCS CEO Charles Allen cautioned Bailey against hasty moves, warning that using company funds for political causes could raise shareholder concerns and risk class action lawsuits. Bailey acknowledged the criticisms as valid but cited Coinbase’s support for Fairshake as an example showing that such practices are possible. He also stated that the effectiveness of the approach will depend on the size of the PAC and the level of industry support. Experts noted that creating such a committee requires appointing a treasurer, registering with the US Federal Election Commission, and regularly reporting expenditures.",News|Legal,EN,1,david bailey plan raise political action committee pac priority include abolishing bitcoin capital gain tax promoting crypto education expert caution regulatory legal challenge using company fund political cause u president donald trump bitcoin advisor bitcoin magazine ceo david bailey announced plan raise million create political action committee pac pac main task promote initiative related bitcoin first cryptocurrency bailey emphasized intention use nakamoto holding investment company specializing managing bitcoin reserve implement initiative stated goal committee influence political agenda also position bitcoin long bailey named reaching price tag priority invited community propose additional idea include abolishing capital gain tax bitcoin sale protecting right independently store cryptocurrency introducing crypto education school expert added initiative alex gladstein director strategy human right foundation suggested seeking protection software developer proposed allowing foreign country repay u debt bitcoin investor tuur demeester emphasized need return banking system time btcs ceo charles allen cautioned bailey hasty move warning using company fund political cause could raise shareholder concern risk class action lawsuit bailey acknowledged criticism valid cited coinbase support fairshake example showing practice possible also stated effectiveness approach depend size pac level industry support expert noted creating committee requires appointing treasurer registering u federal election commission regularly reporting expenditure,0.054,0.819,0.127,0.9169,1

In a speech in January, US President Donald Trump accused BofA of not doing business with conservatives. Said Trump, “Many conservatives complained that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America. They don’t take conservative business, and I don’t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what.” BofA CEO Brian Moynihan argues in a new interview with Face the Nation that the regulators are to blame, not his bank. “We have 70 million consumers and we’re one of the biggest small business lenders. So that’s not it. The issue they’re focused on is the regulators’ impact on this industry, and you heard Senator [Tim] Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after-the-fact look that you banked X, and now, after the fact, you’re going to say X didn’t turn out to be what you thought, so we look at it, we look at it based on risk.

2025-08-05 16:55:11,49591915,1754412911,Financial Privacy: Why Protecting Your Digital Assets is Crucial,"BitcoinWorld Financial Privacy: Why Protecting Your Digital Assets is Crucial In an increasingly digital world, the debate around financial privacy has reached a critical juncture, especially within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As our lives become more intertwined with digital transactions, safeguarding personal financial data is paramount. Recently, a prominent voice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) underscored this very point, sparking an important conversation about our digital rights and the future of digital finance. Why is Financial Privacy So Important Now? The concept of financial privacy isn’t new, but its implications in the age of digital currencies are profound. For many, it’s about maintaining control over one’s own assets and transactions, free from undue surveillance or centralized control. This sentiment was strongly echoed by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce . Speaking at a recent blockchain conference in California, Commissioner Peirce emphasized the vital need for the U.S. to protect individual financial privacy. She argued that regulators, including the SEC, should actively embrace innovative blockchain technology that enhances privacy features and empowers individuals. Her stance highlights a growing recognition within regulatory circles of the unique challenges and opportunities presented by decentralized finance. Peirce’s advocacy for privacy-preserving technologies demonstrates a forward-thinking approach. She believes that enabling individuals to manage their own digital assets securely is not just a matter of convenience, but a fundamental right in a digital economy. This perspective challenges the traditional view that all financial transactions must be transparent to authorities, opening up a crucial dialogue. Embracing Digital Asset Self-Custody: A Path to Freedom? A key aspect of digital financial autonomy, as advocated by Commissioner Peirce, is the ability for individuals to maintain digital asset self-custody . This means holding your own cryptocurrency keys, rather than relying on a third-party exchange or custodian. It’s a foundational principle for many in the crypto community, offering a direct pathway to greater control and reduced counterparty risk. Self-custody empowers users, giving them direct ownership and responsibility for their funds. This contrasts sharply with traditional banking, where banks hold your money. In the crypto world, self-custody means you are your own bank. Katie Biber, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Paradigm, strongly supported Peirce’s perspective. Taking to X, Biber provocatively asked, “Do you want to live in a dystopia where developers are sent to prison for writing code that lets YOU have financial privacy ? I don’t.” Her powerful statement underscores the potential societal consequences if regulators stifle the development of privacy-enhancing tools. Protecting the right to develop such code is crucial for preserving fundamental freedoms in the digital realm. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Cryptocurrency Privacy? While the call for enhanced cryptocurrency privacy is clear, implementing it within existing regulatory frameworks presents significant challenges. Regulators often express concerns about illicit finance, money laundering, and tax evasion when discussing privacy-centric digital assets. Balancing these concerns with individual rights is a complex task that requires careful consideration. However, proponents argue that privacy and compliance are not mutually exclusive. Advancements in blockchain technology , such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), offer ways to verify transactions without revealing sensitive underlying data. This technological evolution could provide solutions that uphold both privacy and necessary regulatory oversight. Consider these important aspects in this ongoing debate: Regulatory Clarity: Establishing clear, adaptable guidelines for privacy-enhancing technologies is vital to foster innovation without compromising security. Technological Innovation: Encouraging the development of advanced tools that balance individual privacy with essential transparency for law enforcement. User Education: Informing the public about the benefits, risks, and best practices of different privacy approaches in digital finance. Global Harmonization: Working towards international standards for financial privacy in the digital asset space to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The path forward requires collaboration between policymakers, technologists, and the crypto community. It’s about finding smart solutions that respect individual liberties while addressing legitimate societal concerns. The ultimate goal is to build a digital financial system that is both secure and respects user privacy. The discourse initiated by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce regarding financial privacy and digital asset self-custody is a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry and individual liberties. It signals a potential shift towards recognizing and protecting fundamental rights in the digital age. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, fostering an environment where innovation thrives while safeguarding individual autonomy will be essential for the future of finance. The debate around cryptocurrency privacy will undoubtedly continue to shape how we interact with our money and data. Frequently Asked Questions What is financial privacy in the context of cryptocurrency? Financial privacy in cryptocurrency refers to an individual’s ability to control who can access their transaction data and holdings. It means having the option to conduct transactions without revealing personal identity or sensitive financial details to third parties, ensuring autonomy over one’s digital assets. Who is SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and what is her stance? Hester Peirce is a Commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), often dubbed “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance on digital assets. She advocates for protecting individual financial privacy and embracing technologies that enable self-custody of cryptocurrencies, promoting innovation while safeguarding user rights. What does “digital asset self-custody” mean? Digital asset self-custody means that an individual directly holds the private keys to their cryptocurrencies, giving them complete control over their funds. Unlike keeping assets on an exchange or with a third-party custodian, self-custody eliminates reliance on intermediaries, enhancing security and privacy. Why are regulators concerned about cryptocurrency privacy? Regulators often express concerns about cryptocurrency privacy due to potential misuse for illicit activities like money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. They seek to balance individual privacy rights with the need to maintain financial transparency and combat illegal operations within the financial system. How can blockchain technology help balance privacy and compliance? Advanced blockchain technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), can help balance privacy and compliance. ZKPs allow one party to prove that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself, enabling verification of transactions or identities without disclosing sensitive data to regulators.

In this transaction, a wallet previously funded by Fidelity Custody moved 10,000 ETH and 4,978 ETH to Coinbase within a five-minute window, according to Arkham Intelligence data provided on August 5. Fidelity Ethereum transfer to Coinbase. Source: Arkham The transfers, valued at approximately $35.77 million and $17.8 million respectively, came just hours after the same wallet received a 6,000 ETH deposit from a Fidelity-linked address. This sequence of events has raised concerns that Fidelity or a related custodian may be preparing to liquidate a significant Ethereum position. Notably, the wallet involved in these transactions has been active over the past month, receiving inflows from major custodians and transferring assets to hot wallets associated with exchanges. The timing and size of the most recent transfers suggest institutional ETH movement, potentially ahead of market volatility or profit-taking. While no direct sale has been confirmed, the use of Coinbase deposit addresses implies a possible intent to sell. More funds are dumping Ethereum Interestingly, Fidelity isn’t the only investment manager offloading Ethereum. As reported by Finbold, BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF recorded its largest single-day outflow since launch on August 4, with 101,975 ETH, worth about $375 million, exiting the fund. The sudden outflow ended a 21-day streak of inflows and slashed the fund’s ETH holdings by roughly 3%, signaling a notable shift in institutional sentiment. As of press time, Ethereum was showing weakness, trading at $3,587, down over 3% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, ETH has dropped by 4%. ETH seven-day price chart.

Bonds convertible into shares or cash; investors can buy an extra $300M in notes. Following Q2 revenue decline, Coinbase shares dropped 15%, but analysts remain optimistic. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced plans to raise $2 billion through a private placement of convertible bonds. According to the company, the issue will be divided into two tranches, maturing in 2029 and 2032. Each tranche will have a volume of $1 billion, the press release states. Investors will also have the right to purchase an additional $300 million in notes across both tranches. Coinbase clarified that the bonds will be offered to institutional investors under Rule 144A, allowing a private placement exempt from SEC registration. The senior unsecured notes will be convertible into Class A shares, cash, or both, at Coinbase's discretion. The company intends to pay interest on these notes semi-annually. Coinbase also plans to enter into call option transactions to reduce potential share dilution from conversions, which they say will offset cash payments exceeding the principal amount of the notes. A portion of the funds raised will cover the costs of these options, with the remainder used for corporate purposes. These include working capital, capital expenditures, and repurchasing or redeeming other debt securities. The bond offering came shortly after Coinbase's Q2 2025 earnings report showed a decline in revenue and an increase in expenses. On this news, shares of Coinbase (ticker: COIN) fell 18%, according to Yahoo Finance. At the time of writing, Coinbase’s shares traded at $302.48, down 4.9% for the day, with a market capitalization of $79.2 billion.

2025-08-05 16:45:10,49591477,1754412310,EU AI Act: A Powerful Blueprint for Responsible AI Innovation,"BitcoinWorld EU AI Act: A Powerful Blueprint for Responsible AI Innovation In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where decentralized technologies like blockchain intersect with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, understanding regulatory shifts is paramount. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and innovators, the European Union’s landmark EU AI Act represents a significant development that could shape not only the future of AI but also its integration with Web3 ecosystems. Just as clear rules foster trust in digital assets, this comprehensive framework aims to create a predictable environment for AI, impacting everything from dApps utilizing AI to blockchain-based AI models. What is the EU AI Act? Described by the European Commission as “the world’s first comprehensive AI law,” the EU AI Act is progressively becoming a reality for the 450 million people across the 27 EU member countries. More than just a regional affair, this legislation holds global implications, applying to both local and foreign companies, whether they are providers or deployers of AI systems. For instance, it would apply equally to a developer creating a CV screening tool and to a bank purchasing that tool for its operations. This broad reach establishes a unified legal framework for AI use, aiming to harmonize practices across the continent and beyond. Why is AI Regulation Crucial for a Level Playing Field? The primary driver behind the AI regulation is to establish a uniform legal framework across all EU countries, preventing fragmented local restrictions on AI. This consistency is vital for ensuring the free movement of AI-based goods and services across borders. By creating a level playing field, the EU seeks to foster trust in AI technologies, which, in turn, can unlock significant opportunities for emerging companies and drive widespread adoption. However, this common framework is not without its demands. Despite the relatively early stage of widespread AI adoption in many sectors, the EU AI Act sets a high bar for ethical and societal considerations. According to European lawmakers, the framework’s main goal is to “promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy AI while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI systems in the Union, and to support innovation.” This ambitious statement highlights the delicate balance between: Promoting AI uptake versus preventing harm. Fostering innovation versus ensuring environmental protection. As with much EU legislation, the practical implications will largely depend on the specifics of how “human-centric” and “trustworthy” AI are defined and enforced. Fostering AI Innovation While Ensuring Safety To navigate the complex balance between preventing harm and harnessing the potential benefits of AI, the EU AI Act adopts a risk-based approach. This tiered system categorizes AI use cases based on their potential to cause harm, leading to differentiated regulatory obligations: Unacceptable Risk: A small number of AI use cases are outright banned due to their potential to violate fundamental rights. Examples include untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV for building databases. High Risk: This category includes AI systems used in critical areas such as healthcare, employment, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure. These systems face stringent regulations, including requirements for data quality, human oversight, transparency, and robustness. Limited Risk: AI systems that pose lower risks are subject to lighter obligations, primarily focused on transparency requirements, ensuring users are aware they are interacting with an AI. This nuanced approach aims to support responsible AI innovation by providing clear guidelines while mitigating potential societal risks. Decoding the Artificial Intelligence Law’s Implementation Timeline The rollout of this pivotal Artificial Intelligence law began on August 1, 2024, but its full implementation is staggered through a series of compliance deadlines. Generally, new market entrants face earlier compliance requirements than companies already offering AI products and services within the EU. The first significant deadline occurred on February 2, 2025, focusing on enforcing bans for prohibited AI uses, such as the untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for facial image databases. While many other provisions will follow, the majority of the Act’s requirements are expected to apply by mid-2026, barring any schedule changes. Understanding GPAI Models and Their Systemic Impact A crucial milestone in the EU AI Act ‘s implementation was August 2, 2025, when the Act began to apply to “general-purpose AI models with systemic risk” (GPAI models). GPAI models are defined as AI models trained on vast amounts of data, capable of performing a wide range of tasks. The “systemic risk” element arises from their broad applicability and potential for widespread impact, such as lowering barriers for chemical or biological weapons development, or unintended issues of control over autonomous GPAI models. Ahead of this deadline, the EU published guidelines for providers of GPAI models, encompassing both European and non-European players like Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI. However, existing market players with models already deployed have been granted a longer compliance window, until August 2, 2027, unlike new entrants. Does the EU AI Act Have Teeth? Penalties and Industry Response The EU AI Act comes with substantial penalties designed to be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive,” even for large global corporations. While specific details will be finalized by individual EU countries, the regulation sets clear thresholds based on the deemed risk level of the infringement: Prohibited AI Applications: Infringements can lead to the highest penalties, up to €35 million or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher. GPAI Model Providers: The European Commission can impose fines of up to €15 million or 3% of annual turnover on providers of GPAI models for non-compliance. The industry’s willingness to engage with the framework is partly indicated by the voluntary GPAI code of practice, which includes commitments like not training models on pirated content. In July 2025, Meta notably declined to sign this code, citing concerns about “overreach” and “legal uncertainties.” In contrast, Google confirmed its participation despite reservations, stating concerns that the Act might slow Europe’s AI development. Other significant signatories include Aleph Alpha, Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, IBM, Microsoft, and Mistral AI. However, signing does not always equate to full endorsement, as seen with Google’s qualified support. European companies have also voiced concerns. Arthur Mensch, CEO of French AI firm Mistral AI, joined other European CEOs in July 2025, signing an open letter urging Brussels to pause the implementation of key obligations for two years. Despite these lobbying efforts, the European Union affirmed its commitment to the established timeline, proceeding with the August 2, 2025, deadline as planned. A New Era for AI The EU AI Act marks a significant turning point in global AI governance. By establishing a comprehensive framework, it aims to foster responsible AI innovation , protect fundamental rights, and create a level playing field for companies worldwide. While the staggered implementation and industry concerns highlight the complexities of regulating a rapidly evolving technology, the Act’s ambitious goals underscore a commitment to human-centric and trustworthy AI. Its success will depend on continued collaboration between policymakers, industry, and civil society to navigate the intricate balance between technological advancement and societal well-being.

2025-08-05 16:40:10,49591320,1754412010,Altcoin Rallies: Why Experts Warn of Potentially Short-Lived Gains,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Rallies: Why Experts Warn of Potentially Short-Lived Gains The cryptocurrency world often buzzes with excitement, especially when it comes to alternative coins. Recently, we have observed a noticeable rise in retail interest in altcoins. However, amidst this enthusiasm, prominent analysts are sounding a note of caution regarding current altcoin rallies . They suggest that these surges may be short-lived, lacking the sustained capital and demand needed for long-term growth. Understanding Current Altcoin Rallies: What Analysts Are Saying Despite a surge in retail interest, as evidenced by Google Trends showing altcoin search interest surpassing Bitcoin in July, market experts remain wary. Analysts at firms like Bitfinex and Presto Labs, as reported by DL News, highlight a critical issue: these recent altcoin rallies often lack deep, sustained investment. This means the buying pressure might not be strong enough to support prolonged price increases. What does this imply for investors? It suggests that while altcoins might experience quick pumps, these movements could quickly reverse. The underlying demand simply isn’t robust enough to absorb selling pressure without significant price drops. Why the Altcoin Market Faces Headwinds? The current state of the altcoin market reveals a telling pattern. We see sharp price slumps following initial spikes, and Bitcoin continues to maintain its dominance. This combination signals that investors are exercising caution. They might be quick to take profits, preventing altcoins from establishing new, higher support levels. Several factors contribute to this cautious environment: Lack of Sustained Capital: Large institutional money, which can drive significant market movements, appears hesitant to flow into the broader altcoin space consistently. Weak Demand: Beyond speculative retail interest, there isn’t enough organic, utility-driven demand to sustain these rallies. Bitcoin’s Influence: When Bitcoin shows strength, it often draws capital away from altcoins, or its volatility can trigger broader market corrections that impact altcoins more severely. Navigating Volatile Crypto Market Trends For those navigating today’s crypto market trends , understanding these dynamics is crucial. Analysts suggest that major altcoin breakouts—those significant, lasting price increases—will likely remain rare in the near term. This outlook requires a more strategic approach to cryptocurrency investing. It is easy to get caught up in the excitement of rapid gains, but the data indicates a need for prudence. Investors should focus on long-term fundamentals rather than chasing fleeting pumps. This measured approach can help mitigate risks in a volatile environment. Strategic Digital Asset Analysis for Informed Decisions Given the analyst warnings, how can you make informed decisions in your cryptocurrency investing journey? Employing robust digital asset analysis is more important than ever. This involves looking beyond short-term price movements and understanding the true value proposition of an altcoin. Consider these actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Investigate the project’s technology, team, use case, and community support. Manage Risk: Allocate only what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio instead of putting all your capital into a single altcoin. Stay Updated: Follow reputable sources and expert analysis to understand broader market sentiment and fundamental shifts. In conclusion, while the allure of quick gains from altcoin rallies is strong, expert analysis points to a challenging environment for sustained growth. The lack of consistent capital and demand, coupled with Bitcoin’s continued dominance, paints a picture of caution. By understanding these dynamics and applying diligent digital asset analysis , investors can navigate the complex crypto market trends more effectively, making more informed choices in their cryptocurrency investing strategies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are altcoin rallies? A1: Altcoin rallies refer to periods when the prices of various cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin, experience significant and rapid increases in value. Q2: Why are analysts cautious about current altcoin rallies? A2: Analysts express caution because these rallies often lack sustained capital inflow and strong demand, leading to quick price slumps rather than long-term growth. Q3: How does Bitcoin dominance affect the altcoin market? A3: Bitcoin dominance indicates that a large portion of the total crypto market capitalization belongs to Bitcoin. High dominance can mean capital is flowing into Bitcoin, or that investor caution leads them to prefer Bitcoin’s stability over altcoins, thereby limiting altcoin growth. Q4: What should I do to navigate current crypto market trends? A4: Focus on thorough research, practice strong risk management, and stay informed about market fundamentals. Avoid chasing speculative pumps and prioritize long-term investment strategies. Q5: Is it still worthwhile for cryptocurrency investing in altcoins despite the warnings? A5: Yes, but with increased caution and strategic digital asset analysis. While major breakouts may be rare, carefully selected altcoins with strong fundamentals can still offer potential, but always be aware of the higher risks involved.

Both have shown clear signs of a comeback lately, and that’s turning heads in the crypto space. But here’s the twist: while SHIB and DOGE prepare for another run, 2025 may belong to a bold newcomer—LILPEPE, a meme coin with real utility and the potential to deliver over 12,000% gains before the year ends. Let’s unpack what’s happening. SHIB and DOGE Are Back In Action You’ve probably noticed the spark if you’ve been watching SHIB recently. The coin’s up over 60% in the past few weeks, and it’s not just hype driving it. A massive increase in SHIB burn rates—some reports say 16,000%+ in daily burns—has tightened supply, pushing the price upward fast. SHIB breaking past resistance around $0.000019 could open the door to a rally toward $0.000025, and analysts believe this move is still in play. The vibe in the SHIB community is picking up, too, especially now that token burns are accelerating, and large holders (whales) are moving SHIB off exchanges—typically a sign of holding for longer-term gains. According to this recent analysis , many crypto traders are eyeing a 40% pump in the coming weeks. DOGE, not to be outdone, is making its comeback. The coin’s price climbed above $0.17, and futures open interest has exploded—over 18 billion DOGE traded in just 24 hours, showing demand is flooding back in. Elon Musk’s subtle but powerful endorsement last week—“I like dogs and memes” and referring to DOGE as “the people’s crypto”—didn’t hurt either. It’s like a spark that lit the whole community back up. Some analysts now believe DOGE could revisit $0.36 and climb as high as $1.00 by the end of 2025. So yeah, SHIB and DOGE are alive, kicking, and ready to surprise us again. But Here’s the Meme Coin Everyone’s Whispering About: LILPEPE While SHIB and DOGE are the OGs of meme culture, LILPEPE is quickly becoming the most talked‑about meme coin of 2025. And for good reason. Built on an EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain, LILPEPE blends meme appeal with real infrastructure. Think ultra-low gas fees, high speeds, smart contract support, and everything DeFi-ready. But the presale performance is grabbing attention even more, and it’s crazy impressive. The presale is now in Stage 9, selling at $0.0018 per token. Over $14 million has already been raised from excited early supporters, with Stage 9 now more than 87% filled. Once Stage 10 opens, the price jumps again to $0.0019, and it’ll keep rising across the 15 stages until launch. Those who got in at Stage 1 have already seen their investment grow by 80%, and current Stage 9 buyers still stand to make a 66.6% gain by launch, when the token will list at $0.0030. Some experts say the potential is way beyond that—LILPEPE could soar to $0.10 or even $0.50 before the year ends. That’s more than a 12,000% return from current levels. No exaggeration. You can dive into the latest numbers here . It’s also officially listed on CoinMarketCap, giving it another layer of trust and visibility, just like SHIB and DOGE had during their early breakout runs. And don’t forget, LILPEPE is also running a $777,000 giveaway, where 10 winners will each walk away with $77K worth of tokens. All it takes is a minimum $100 contribution and a few simple community tasks. That kind of incentive has only added fuel to the already growing hype. The giveaway details are all on the official site’s giveaway page . Final Take SHIB and DOGE are back on track and could deliver solid returns over the next 12 months. But if you’re looking for that next-level opportunity, something that could be 100x or even 120x, LILPEPE is the one meme coin that could pull it off. With only a few days left in Stage 9 of the presale, now might be your last chance to get in before the next price jump. You can join the presale , explore what the project is building, or even try your luck in the massive $777K giveaway . Whatever you do, don’t sleep on LILPEPE. Because if it delivers even half of what analysts are projecting, 2025 could be a year to remember.

2025-08-05 16:35:11,49591108,1754411711,Google NotebookLM Revolutionizes Student Access to AI Education,"BitcoinWorld Google NotebookLM Revolutionizes Student Access to AI Education In an era where digital innovation reshapes every industry, from decentralized finance to educational methodologies, the integration of artificial intelligence into learning is becoming increasingly pivotal. For those tracking the rapid advancements in technology, particularly AI, the latest move by Google marks a significant shift in the AI education landscape. Google’s note-taking application, NotebookLM, previously accessible only to adults, is now opening its doors to a younger demographic, signaling a new frontier in how students engage with academic materials. Google NotebookLM Unlocks New Learning Potential Google’s commitment to expanding access to powerful AI tools is evident with the recent update to Google NotebookLM . This AI-powered note-taking and research assistant, once exclusive to users aged 18 and above, is now available to a much broader audience. Specifically, Google Workspace for Education users, regardless of age, can now leverage its capabilities, alongside general consumers aged 13 and up. This strategic expansion aims to provide younger students with sophisticated research and comprehension tools, directly addressing the evolving needs of modern education. The platform offers a suite of features designed to transform how students interact with their learning materials. Imagine converting extensive notes into engaging, podcast-like Audio Overviews , allowing for auditory learning on the go. Students can also visually summarize complex ideas using interactive Mind Maps , fostering a deeper understanding of interconnected concepts. Furthermore, the recently introduced Video Overviews feature enables users to convert notes, PDFs, and images into dynamic visual presentations, making study and revision more interactive and effective. These features are not just conveniences; they represent a fundamental shift towards more adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The Evolving Landscape of AI Education The move by Google highlights a broader trend: the intensifying competition and rapid innovation within the AI education sector. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, its potential applications in teaching and learning are expanding exponentially. Educational institutions and technology providers are recognizing the immense value AI can bring, from personalized tutoring and automated grading to advanced research assistance. This competitive environment pushes companies to develop more intuitive, powerful, and accessible AI solutions, ultimately benefiting students worldwide. The focus is shifting from basic digital tools to intelligent assistants that can genuinely enhance cognitive processes and academic outcomes. Empowering Students with AI Tools Providing AI tools for students is about more than just convenience; it’s about fostering critical thinking, research skills, and deeper comprehension. NotebookLM acts as a personal research assistant, helping students sift through vast amounts of information, synthesize key points, and organize their thoughts. For instance, a student researching a complex historical event can feed multiple articles, documents, and even lecture notes into NotebookLM. The AI can then help them identify recurring themes, generate summaries, and even suggest connections they might have missed. This capability is particularly beneficial for complex subjects, enabling students to grasp intricate details and overarching concepts more efficiently. It empowers them to move beyond rote memorization to true understanding and analytical engagement. Navigating Challenges in EdTech While the benefits of integrating AI into learning are clear, the expansion of such powerful platforms raises important questions, especially concerning data privacy and the potential for misuse. The EdTech sector, particularly with AI, faces scrutiny regarding how student data is handled and whether these tools might inadvertently facilitate academic dishonesty. Google is acutely aware of these concerns. For users under 18, NotebookLM enforces stricter content policies, designed to prevent the generation of inappropriate or harmful responses. Crucially, Google has stated that user chats and uploaded content are not reviewed by humans, nor are they used for training the underlying AI models. This commitment to privacy and responsible AI development is essential for building trust among students, parents, and educators, ensuring that these tools serve as aids rather than liabilities. Student AI Assistant: A Competitive Arena The availability of NotebookLM for younger users is not an isolated event; it’s a clear indicator of the burgeoning competition in the market for a dedicated student AI assistant . Google’s strategic move follows similar initiatives from other tech giants. Notably, OpenAI recently introduced a ‘study mode’ for ChatGPT, signaling its intent to capture a share of the educational market. This increasing rivalry among leading AI developers promises to accelerate innovation, leading to more diverse and sophisticated AI-powered learning solutions. For students, this competition means a wider array of choices, potentially more affordable access, and continually improving features designed to support their academic journeys. The ultimate winners in this competitive landscape will be those platforms that can best balance powerful functionality with robust privacy and ethical safeguards. Google’s decision to make NotebookLM accessible to younger students marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI in education. By providing advanced AI tools that facilitate research, comprehension, and organization, Google is not just enhancing learning; it is helping to shape the future of how students interact with knowledge. While challenges related to privacy and responsible use persist, the proactive measures taken by companies like Google indicate a commitment to developing AI solutions that are both powerful and secure. As the AI education space continues to heat up, students stand to gain immensely from these innovative assistants, transforming the learning experience for generations to come.

2025-08-05 16:31:52,49590783,1754411512,XRP Revs Up After a Clean Two-Legged Pullback as Ripple Joins Global Billion-Dollar Elite,"Will XRP Soar to $3.40? According to market analyst Lingrid, “XRP bounced from its rising support after completing a clean two-legged pullback, reclaiming bullish posture near the 2.70–2.80 zone. The consolidation phase is forming higher lows, suggesting accumulation within an ascending structure.” She added that if the trendline holds, XRP could break toward the $3.40 resistance, a decisive move above it may ignite the next bullish leg. Based on this analysis, Lingrid highlighted that XRP executed a clean two-step pullback, briefly dipping below trendline support before stabilizing between $2.70–$2.80. The rebound formed higher lows and reclaimed the uptrend, a classic accumulation behavior, with strong bids near channel support and resilience against breakdowns. Therefore, Maintaining support above the $2.70–$2.80 zone while forming higher lows may clear the way for XRP to challenge near‑term resistance at $3.40, which might ignite the fire towards the all-time high (ATH) of $3.65. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.98, according to CoinGecko data . Ripple Ranks Among World’s Top Private Companies According to the most recent CB Insights data, San Francisco‑based Ripple is now ranked as the 23rd most valuable private company globally, with a valuation of $15 billion. At the pinnacle of the list stands Elon Musk’s SpaceX, valued at about $350 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the world. Following closely are ByteDance, the parent of TikTok and OpenAI, each valued at $300 billion. Why the Ranking Is Significant First, appearing in CB Insights’ global top‑25 underscores Ripple’s transformational shift from a crypto startup to a mainstream fintech infrastructure provider. It now ranks alongside giants like SpaceX, ByteDance, and OpenAI. The presence of Ripple in this list highlights its role in redefining blockchain-based enterprise services, not just speculative token trading. Key Drivers Behind the $15B Valuation Regulatory Clarity from SEC Resolution Ripple exited its long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after securing a favorable settlement, clarifying that XRP isn’t a security in secondary sales. That ruling helped lift a major cloud of uncertainty around the company’s operations. Robust Institutional Adoption Ripple’s technology, built on the XRP Ledger and RippleNet, is now used by global financial institutions seeking faster and more transparent cross-border payments. This enterprise-first strategy enhances long-term value compared to retail-only crypto plays. Global Expansion & Infrastructure Development Ripple is expanding aggressively via partnerships in the Middle East and Europe. It’s pursuing a MiCA license in the EU, applying for a U.S. OCC trust bank charter to support tokenized asset issuance and its RLUSD stablecoin , and enhancing its developer ecosystem via RippleX. The Broader Implications Ripple’s inclusion as the 23rd most valuable private company sends a powerful signal that blockchain-based financial infrastructure can compete with traditional tech firms at scale. It also reflects a growing institutional trust in regulated, enterprise-grade crypto solutions. According to CBInsights, “A unicorn company, or unicorn startup, is a private company with a valuation over $1 billion. As of July 2025, there are over 1,200 unicorns around the world.” Conclusion Ripple's $15 billion valuation on CB Insights’ list marks a watershed moment not just for the company but for blockchain adoption in finance. With legal hurdles clearing, growing institutional traction, and an expanding global footprint, Ripple isn’t just riding the wave of crypto interest, it’s building the infrastructure of tokenized finance for the future, which might continue igniting XRP’s bullish momentum with the altcoin recently witnessing a two-legged pullback.",News|Ripple,EN,1,xrp soar according market analyst lingrid xrp bounced rising support completing clean pullback reclaiming bullish posture near zone consolidation phase forming higher low suggesting accumulation within ascending added trendline hold xrp could break toward resistance decisive move may ignite next bullish leg based analysis lingrid highlighted xrp executed clean pullback briefly dipping trendline support stabilizing rebound formed higher low reclaimed uptrend classic accumulation behavior strong bid near channel support resilience breakdown therefore maintaining support zone forming higher low may clear way xrp challenge resistance might ignite fire towards high ath time writing xrp trading according coingecko data ripple rank among world top private company according recent cb insight data san ripple ranked valuable private company globally valuation billion pinnacle list stand elon musk spacex valued billion making valuable private company world following closely bytedance parent tiktok openai valued billion ranking significant first appearing cb insight global underscore ripple transformational shift crypto startup mainstream fintech infrastructure provider rank alongside giant like spacex bytedance openai presence ripple list highlight role redefining enterprise service speculative token trading key driver behind valuation regulatory clarity sec resolution ripple exited legal battle security exchange commission sec securing favorable settlement clarifying xrp security secondary sale ruling helped lift major cloud uncertainty around company operation robust institutional adoption ripple technology built xrp ledger ripplenet used global financial institution seeking faster transparent payment strategy enhances value compared crypto play global expansion infrastructure development ripple expanding aggressively via partnership middle east europe pursuing mica license eu applying occ trust bank charter support tokenized asset issuance rlusd stablecoin enhancing developer ecosystem via ripplex broader implication ripple inclusion valuable private company sends powerful signal financial infrastructure compete traditional tech firm scale also reflects growing institutional trust regulated crypto solution according cbinsights unicorn company unicorn startup private company valuation billion july unicorn around conclusion ripple billion valuation cb insight list mark watershed moment company blockchain adoption finance legal hurdle clearing growing institutional traction expanding global footprint ripple riding wave crypto interest building infrastructure tokenized finance future might continue igniting xrp bullish momentum altcoin recently witnessing pullback,0.054,0.675,0.27,0.9978,1
2025-08-05 16:31:18,49590923,1754411478,Altseason on Hold? Altcoins Decline as Bitcoin Falls Below Local Support (Bitfinex),"Over the past three weeks, bitcoin (BTC) has been testing its local range lows near $115,800. Unfortunately, it gave way over the weekend, and the leading cryptocurrency fell to $112,000. Interestingly, altcoins followed suit, seemingly abandoning the bullish momentum they had ridden during this altseason. This raises the question of whether this decline is just a break in the altseason or the end altogether. Bitcoin Falls Below Local Support Bitcoin’s decline follows persistent market weakness amid aggressive speculative risk rotation toward ether (ETH) and other altcoins. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , the move signals a shift in market structure and rising downside vulnerability. The market’s current condition suggests that speculative appetite is declining across sectors, with cautious sentiment and elevated leverage. Before any catalysts can trigger strong directional momentum, there could be a period of reduced volatility and consolidation. This could be exacerbated as bitcoin’s loss of range support acts as resistance. Although BTC is struggling and may continue to do so in the meantime, altcoins are having it worse. Despite recent selling pressure, bitcoin’s market cap has remained above $2.2 trillion, accounting for almost double its 2021 cycle peak. ETH and the aggregate altcoin market, on the other hand, have failed to exceed their 2021 highs. This suggests that investors have remained cautious even while rotating their capital into high-beta and less mature assets. Is Altseason Dead? Worse still, altcoins performed worse than bitcoin last week. While BTC has fallen just 8.9% from its all-time high, ETH closed last week with a 9.7% plunge. The OTHERS index, which tracks the broader altcoin market aside the top ten, showed that this group of assets closed the week 11.5% in the red. ETH has plummeted 15% from its recent local peak, while the OTHER index is down 18.7% below its cycle high. Furthermore, the OTHERS index has shed roughly $59 billion in value over the last 11 days, reflecting rapid derisking among investors. “This contraction signals a clear waning of speculative appetite in the altcoin sector, which had seen a rapid expansion of open interest throughout July, even as BTC remained trapped within a tight trading range,” Bitfinex analysts stated. Meanwhile, only two large-cap assets are in the green over the last two trading weeks: ENA, the utility token of the synthetic dollar protocol, Ethena, and PENGU, the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) project, Pudgy Penguins. Although both assets are up 14.5% and 8.4%, respectively, they are also down from their all-time highs. The post Altseason on Hold?

2025-08-05 16:31:14,49590932,1754411474,Trump Expected to Sign Order Targeting Discrimination by Banks Against Crypto Firms,"White House to require probes into debanking of crypto firms and conservative groups. Trump may sign order before August 8, 2025, targeting bank discrimination practices. The order targets violations under credit, antitrust, and consumer protection laws. The White House will issue an order that will require financial regulators to investigate cases of debanking among crypto companies and conservative organizations, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing a draft of the order. The initiative is aimed at investigating violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws, and consumer financial protection laws. Counterparties caught violating these laws may face various disciplinary measures, including fines. The Wall Street Journal noted that US President Donald Trump may sign the order this week, before August 8, 2025. However, the publication also emphasized that the administration previously considered similar measures in June, but they were ultimately postponed. Combating crypto-related debanking is among Trump's campaign promises. He said he intends to end the so-called Choke Point 2.0 operation. The term refers to a series of measures taken under the Biden administration aimed at distancing crypto companies from the financial sector. Some experts and politicians believe this contributed to the closure of banks such as SVB, Signature, and Silvergate Capital. The order also aims to combat political debanking, particularly of conservative organizations. The document criticizes the role of financial institutions involved in actions taken following the January 2021 Capitol riots. The initiators were supporters of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, backed by Trump. In some cases, the order requires violations to be reported to the Attorney General. This requirement may indicate the possibility of more serious sanctions beyond administrative penalties.",News|Crypto,EN,1,white house require probe debanking crypto firm conservative group trump may sign order august targeting bank discrimination practice order target violation credit antitrust consumer protection law white house issue order require financial regulator investigate case debanking among crypto company conservative organization wall street journal report citing draft order initiative aimed investigating violation equal credit opportunity act antitrust law consumer financial protection law counterparties caught violating law may face various disciplinary measure including fine wall street journal noted u president donald trump may sign order week august however publication also emphasized administration previously considered similar measure june ultimately postponed combating debanking among trump campaign promise said intends end choke point operation term refers series measure taken biden administration aimed distancing crypto company financial sector expert politician believe contributed closure bank svb signature silvergate capital order also aim combat political debanking particularly conservative organization document criticizes role financial institution involved action taken following january capitol riot initiator supporter make america great maga movement backed trump case order requires violation reported attorney general requirement may indicate possibility serious sanction beyond administrative penalty,0.148,0.759,0.093,-0.9136,0
2025-08-05 16:30:33,49592192,1754411433,"Why Fair Access, Speed, and Clarity Shape the Spartans Model","In a space where unclear rules and limited access are still common, Spartans shows that fairness and function can work together. Built as a crypto-native sportsbook and casino, it is designed to remove confusion through clear terms, fast payments, and global reach. The goal is not to build hype or wait for future upgrades. Spartans already runs on three key areas that users care about: clarity, speed, and access. Whether betting on sports, playing table games, or cashing out, users know the rules and see consistent results. How Spartans Builds Trust Through Open Bonus Terms Spartans follows a simple approach: explain everything upfront. The 300% bonus is open to all users with no location limits or unclear terms. The structure is easy to follow: 300% bonus on first deposit 35x wagering requirement 7-day time limit Full withdrawal terms listed There are no unclear conditions or hidden limits. Users know what the bonus includes and how to make it work. This same openness is part of the entire platform. Return-to-player (RTP) details are visible. Game providers are listed. All game mechanics are set for fair play and easy tracking. Players are not left searching for answers or contacting support to find out where their funds went. In a market where shifting bonus rules and unclear systems are common, Spartans follows a clear and stable structure. Speed-First Payments Built for Crypto Users Most casinos still make players wait for their money. Spartans is built differently. Every deposit and withdrawal uses crypto, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether supported. Payouts are completed instantly. That’s not a future feature. It’s how the system already works. There are no slow payment services, long review checks, or delays linked to fiat currency. Once you request a withdrawal, the funds go straight to your wallet and can be tracked on-chain. This setup matters most for users playing fast-moving games like blackjack, roulette, or crash, or those active in live sports betting. When timing matters, slow systems are not acceptable. Spartans provides a payment system designed around crypto habits: fast, direct, and always in the user’s hands. Full Access Across Devices Without App Limits Spartans does not separate users by device, location, or app support. It runs completely in the browser, built for desktop and mobile, so everyone gets the same version of the platform. No player is limited by where they are or what device they use. There is no need to download anything or worry about system updates. Signup, deposit, and gameplay all start within seconds. Whether using a phone for live sports bets or a laptop for table games, the experience stays consistent and fast. This design choice is part of Spartans’ broader approach. Instead of putting features behind app stores or updates, everything is in one place. This also cuts down on risks, keeps the process smooth, and supports better performance overall. A Unified System for All Betting Formats Spartans is focused on doing key things well. With 5,963 games, support from over 43 providers, and a sportsbook that covers global events, it brings everything together in one easy-to-use platform. Players can move between crash games, casino tables, or sports bets with no delays. It works in real time and avoids the lag or clutter found on some larger platforms. The interface is designed for speed, helping users stay focused. Instead of packing in extra layers or pop-ups, the site keeps betting direct and responsive. Each part of the experience is shaped by three values: simple rules, fast crypto use, and stable design. A Setup That Prioritizes the Player Spartans is not trying to change how betting works. It is focusing on what matters: clarity, speed, and trust. With open bonus rules, fast crypto withdrawals, and full access without barriers, it removes the usual points of failure. There are no promised features waiting to launch or locked areas that require future updates. Spartans already runs at full capacity, offering tools that support real-time betting without slowing users down. For players who prefer direct systems and clear terms, this platform presents a working model. It avoids extra steps and focuses on delivering the basics well.

The company confirmed through an August 4 announcement on X that tens of thousands of Seeker units are currently en route to customers. Early recipients have verified the delivery and reported that the device is priced between $450-$500, featuring premium specifications including a MediaTek 8-core processor, 8GB of RAM paired with 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery with wireless charging capability.

Solana Seeker’s Decentralized Mobile Infrastructure Challenges Apple & Google Tech The Solana Seeker smartphone, first revealed in September 2024 , represents the successor to the Saga, Solana’s inaugural crypto-native device in its series of Web3-integrated mobile offerings. Market projections suggest the Seeker is positioned to generate approximately $67.5 million in gross revenue for Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of blockchain technology firm Solana Labs. Through the Seeker, Solana Mobile seeks to decentralize device economics and incentive structures. This vision is powered by TEEPIN (Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network), a technological framework. The system connects hardware components, verified software, users, and network Guardians to establish a truly decentralized mobile platform. Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile, emphasizes that the Seeker focuses on creating “rewarding” ecosystem connections rather than traditional mobile experiences. The future of mobile crypto is almost here – Seeker ships August 4th! @solanamobile GM @m_it unpacks the native SKR token, TEEPIN security stack, a growing dApp store 2.0, and opening the ecosystem to new devices. Can it become the gold standard for mobile crypto? pic.twitter.com/m8HThsr2qU — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 30, 2025 Hollyer explains, “ It revolutionizes the conventional mobile business model by providing stakeholders with actual platform ownership. “ Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, articulates the ambitious goal of establishing a premium mobile ecosystem capable of competing with industry giants Google and Apple. He further elaborates on the technical possibilities: “ For instance, when the Seeker mobile generates proprietary keys guaranteed against leakage, it can implement independent double-spend protection completely offline. Users could transmit or receive tokens, even execute smart contracts, without blockchain interaction or finalization delays. “ Solana SKR Token Airdrop Could Mirror BONK’s 30M Token Bonanza The Solana Seeker includes a Genesis NFT providing owners access to future airdrops, exclusive content, and reward programs, with particular focus on the planned native ecosystem token, SKR . SKR represents the native ecosystem token for Solana mobile devices, operating on Solana’s layer-1 blockchain and expected to be “airdropped directly to builders and users for ecosystem participation.” Many industry observers believe the SKR token airdrop could replicate the success of the BONK airdrop that revitalized Saga sales after months of sluggish performance. Market sentiment suggests strong potential for rapid sellout and contribution to the anticipated “Solana summer” positive momentum. The Solana Network and its ecosystem have demonstrated strong performance throughout 2025, positively influencing SOL cryptocurrency valuations. While SOL remains down year-to-date, the asset shows renewed upward momentum and appears positioned to challenge the $200 resistance level. Source: TradingView The Seeker mobile rollout announcement has already driven SOL prices up by 2.12%, with many analysts believing further gains could mirror the 14% surge witnessed when the Android device was initially unveiled at Token 2049 in Singapore. The potential approval of the first spot SOL ETFs by the SEC could serve as an additional rally catalyst. Recently, major firms, including Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Canary Capital, and CoinShares, submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, increasing approval odds to over 95% .

2025-08-05 16:25:11,49590728,1754411111,Coinbase MAMO EUL: Unveiling Exciting New Listings,"BitcoinWorld Coinbase MAMO EUL: Unveiling Exciting New Listings The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the latest news from Coinbase. In a significant move, the popular exchange recently announced its support for two dynamic digital assets: Coinbase MAMO EUL . This expansion includes Mamo (MAMO) on the Base network and Euler (EUL), an ERC-20 token, on the Ethereum network. This development marks an exciting step for both projects and the wider crypto community. What Does Coinbase MAMO EUL Support Mean for Traders? Coinbase’s decision to list these tokens opens up new avenues for traders and investors. Mamo, operating on the burgeoning Base network, gains immense visibility and liquidity. Similarly, the Euler EUL Token , already a part of the robust Ethereum ecosystem, will now reach a broader audience through one of the world’s largest exchanges. This increased accessibility is a key benefit. Users can now easily buy, sell, and trade these assets directly on Coinbase, simplifying the process for many. It also lends a significant layer of legitimacy to both MAMO and EUL, as Coinbase is known for its rigorous listing process and adherence to regulatory standards. Exploring MAMO on the Base Network Mamo (MAMO) is a project built on the Base network, a Layer 2 blockchain incubated by Coinbase itself. The integration of MAMO Base Network support directly aligns with Coinbase’s strategic interest in fostering growth within its own ecosystem. This move could signal a growing trend of Base-native tokens gaining traction on major exchanges. For users, trading MAMO on Base offers potential advantages like lower transaction fees and faster processing times compared to the main Ethereum network. This efficiency can significantly enhance the trading experience, especially for active participants. It demonstrates Coinbase’s commitment to scaling solutions and embracing emerging blockchain technologies. Understanding the Euler EUL Token on Ethereum Euler (EUL) is an ERC-20 token associated with the Euler Protocol, a permissionless lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum. The addition of the Euler EUL Token to Coinbase’s extensive lineup further solidifies its presence in the DeFi space. EUL holders can now leverage Coinbase’s secure platform for their transactions, benefiting from its robust security measures and user-friendly interface. Euler’s focus on capital efficiency and robust risk management has made it a notable player in decentralized finance. Its listing on Coinbase provides a regulated and user-friendly gateway for new investors to engage with the protocol’s native token, potentially driving further adoption and innovation within the DeFi sector. Why Are Coinbase Listings So Significant? When Coinbase adds new assets, it often triggers considerable market interest. These Coinbase Listings are not just simple additions; they represent a stamp of approval from a highly reputable exchange. This can lead to increased trading volume, enhanced liquidity, and often, price appreciation for the newly listed tokens due to increased demand and exposure. For projects like Mamo and Euler, a Coinbase listing provides unparalleled exposure. It brings their tokens to millions of retail and institutional investors globally, significantly boosting their adoption and recognition within the crypto landscape. This is why crypto exchange news regarding new listings is always keenly watched by market participants. What Are the Benefits and Considerations for New Listings? The addition of MAMO and EUL brings several advantages, but also requires careful consideration: Increased Accessibility: It becomes easier for new and existing users to acquire MAMO and EUL, lowering barriers to entry. Enhanced Liquidity: Higher trading volumes contribute to a healthier, more stable market for these assets, benefiting all participants. Credibility Boost: A Coinbase listing signals a level of trust and due diligence, often perceived as an endorsement of the project’s viability. Ecosystem Growth: This move supports the Base network’s development and strengthens the broader DeFi sector on Ethereum, fostering innovation. However, potential investors should also consider: Market Volatility: Newly listed assets can experience significant price swings immediately after listing. Due Diligence: Always conduct your own thorough research into the project’s fundamentals, team, and technology before investing in any cryptocurrency. Network Congestion: While Base aims for efficiency, high demand during peak times can still impact transaction speeds and fees. Staying Ahead in Crypto Exchange News Keeping up with crypto exchange news is crucial for any participant in the digital asset market. Coinbase’s continuous expansion of its supported assets reflects the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the industry. These new listings highlight the ongoing innovation within both the Base and Ethereum ecosystems, showcasing the diverse opportunities available. To make informed decisions, always verify information from official sources like Coinbase’s announcements and the projects’ whitepapers. Understanding the underlying technology and purpose of each token, such as Coinbase MAMO EUL , is paramount before engaging in any trading activity. Responsible participation is key to navigating the crypto landscape successfully. In conclusion, Coinbase’s addition of Mamo and Euler (EUL) is a significant development that broadens access to promising digital assets. This move reinforces Coinbase’s role as a leading platform for crypto enthusiasts, providing new opportunities while emphasizing the importance of informed participation in the evolving crypto landscape. It’s a testament to the continuous growth and diversification of the digital asset market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are MAMO and EUL? MAMO is a token operating on the Base network, while EUL is an ERC-20 token associated with the Euler Protocol on the Ethereum network. Both are distinct digital assets with their own unique use cases within their respective ecosystems. Which networks do MAMO and EUL operate on? MAMO operates on the Base network, which is a Layer 2 solution incubated by Coinbase. EUL is an ERC-20 token, meaning it operates on the Ethereum network. Why is a Coinbase listing important for cryptocurrencies? A Coinbase listing provides significant exposure to millions of users, enhances liquidity, and often boosts a token’s credibility due to Coinbase’s stringent listing criteria and reputation in the crypto space. What should I consider before trading newly listed tokens? Before trading, always conduct thorough research into the project, understand its fundamentals, and be aware of potential market volatility. New listings can experience significant price fluctuations. How can I stay updated on Coinbase’s new listings? You can stay updated by following Coinbase’s official announcements on their blog, social media channels (like X), and their official website.

2025-08-05 16:24:54,49590874,1754411094,"Bitcoin is struggling as liquidity dries up across spot, futures, options, and ETF markets","Bitcoin’s run is now hanging by a thread. Liquidity is drying up fast, and that slowdown is hitting spot, futures, options, and ETF markets all at once. Across every major segment, trading activity is thinning out, positioning is turning cautious, and momentum is cooling. Prices are currently stuck below the $114,000 threshold, right where it’s been repeatedly rejected. Data from Glassnode shows the Relative Strength Index fell hard, dropping from 47.4 to 35.8, which pushed it under its low band and straight into oversold territory. Cumulative Volume Delta turned sharply negative, diving from -$107.1 million to -$220 million, showing heavy sell-side activity. At the same time, spot volume shrank from $8.4 billion to $7.5 billion, confirming the lack of liquidity and overall softer engagement from traders. Futures unwind, puts dominate options, and ETF inflows fall In the futures market, open interest edged down slightly from $45.6 billion to $44.9 billion, and long-side funding dropped by a full third, falling to $3.1 million, which just means appetite for leveraged bullish trades is disappearing. On top of that, perpetual CVD sank from -$1.2 billion to -$1.8 billion, which is well under its low band. But open interest fell by 8.4% to $39.8 billion, which means there’s a lot less speculative betting going on. The volatility spread narrowed from 23.84% to 16.26%, so the market is pricing in less risk overall. But at the same time, 25 Delta Skew jumped to 5.51%, which is above the high band. Even more worrying is the put-to-call ratio. Crypto traders usually lean bullish, so puts tend to trail calls by a wide margin. Right now, though, that ratio is up at 90%, and on Friday and Saturday, it actually went over 100%. That’s rare and signals real fear. Put options are now trading at a premium to calls, which flips the usual pricing dynamic. Net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs collapsed 24.9% to $269.4 million, well under the usual lower bound, which points to fading institutional interest, per Glassnode. Yet at the same time, trading volume on ETFs rose 9.9% to $19.8 billion, showing that investors are still active, but more reactive than proactive. Meanwhile, the MVRV ratio for ETFs dropped slightly from 2.4 to 2.3. Network activity cools as real-world fears seep into crypto market Bitcoin’s active addresses rose 3.6% to 729,000, but transfer volume went the other way, falling 13.9% to $9.4 billion. Transaction fees also dropped by 14.4% to $483,200, and the Realized Cap Change held at 6.3%, which means there’s still some strong capital flow on-chain, according to Glassnode’s data. Liquidity indicators were stable. The Short-Term Holder to Long-Term Holder ratio stayed put at 17.3%, and Hot Capital Share remained at 36%. That consistency suggests the market isn’t panicking, but it’s not gaining steam either. Profitability metrics dropped. The Percent of Supply in Profit is now at 93.6%, NUPL fell to 8.6%, and the Realized P/L Ratio dipped to 1.9. Less profit means less confidence. And while none of this automatically means traders expect Bitcoin to collapse, the hedging behavior is real. Much of it is being driven by concerns outside of crypto itself. A major pressure point is the concentration of money in AI stocks. Nvidia and Microsoft are now the two most valuable companies by market cap. And energy markets aren’t offering any cushion either. Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, reported a 19% drop in profit year-on-year due to declining global oil prices. That kind of result adds to the overall sense of caution in every part of the market, including crypto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-08-05 16:16:46,49591378,1754410606,"SHIB led the 2021 rally, but 2025’s bull run could belong to this meme coin under $0.002","In 2021, SHIB exploded onto the scene and delivered one of crypto history’s most profitable bull runs. But history doesn’t just repeat — it evolves. And now, as 2025’s bull cycle gains momentum, a new meme coin is catching fire with early investors and insiders who say it could be the next to explode. That coin is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — a next-generation meme crypto priced under $0.002. It’s armed with real tech, serious community backing, and a strategic roadmap that positions it as a smarter, faster version of the meme giants that came before it. SHIB may have led the 2021 rally, but LILPEPE is emerging as the token that could lead 2025’s meme coin mania. Why 2021’s SHIB run still matters SHIB’s meteoric rise was no accident. It capitalized on a perfect mix of meme virality, tokenomics, and market timing. SHIB launched with 1 quadrillion tokens and zero utility. But that didn’t stop it from reaching a nearly $40 billion market cap during peak euphoria. Why? Accessibility and hype. SHIB made people feel like they could still be early — that even a few hundred dollars could deliver generational returns. The community rallied, exchanges piled in, and the price did the impossible. But now, in 2025, meme coin investors are savvier. They want more than just hype. They want utility, transparency, and upside without predatory taxes or sniper bots. That’s precisely the mold Little Pepe is breaking. Meet Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The meme coin with real muscle Little Pepe isn’t just a copy-paste token riding a frog meme. It’s the first meme coin project to build its own Layer-2 chain, tailor-made for meme culture and DeFi adoption. While SHIB spent years trying to build post-hype infrastructure, LILPEPE has tech at its core. Here’s what sets it apart: Layer-2 meme chain LILPEPE’s Ethereum-based Layer-2 chain supports lightning-fast, low-cost transactions, intending to become the go-to launchpad for future meme tokens. This gives it a real economic base beyond just speculative trading. Meme launchpad & builder tools LILPEPE is creating an ecosystem where new meme projects can launch, raise funds, and gain visibility without deep dev expertise. It’s a full-stack meme economy with value-generating mechanisms. Zero tax, anti-sniper protections LILPEPE removes one of the biggest pain points in crypto: high slippage and front-running bots. Every trade is zero-tax, with smart contract-level protection against bots and bad actors. Massive community incentives The project is running a $777,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 in $LILPEPE each. To qualify, users must contribute at least $100 to the presale and complete entry tasks on the official platform. This has supercharged word-of-mouth growth and viral traction on social media. Strategic CEX listings coming While many meme coins struggle to gain serious exchange attention, LILPEPE has already confirmed two top-tier CEX listings at launch. Rumors say the team also aims to list on the world’s largest exchange platform. Its recent CoinMarketCap listing has already triggered a new wave of visibility and investor confidence. Presale firestorm: $14M raised and stage 9 half gone Little Pepe’s presale has become one of the hottest in 2025, with over $14 million already raised. Priced at just $0.0018, early buyers scramble to lock in positions before the next stage pushes it to $0.0019. With over 9.9 billion tokens already sold out of the 11.25 billion target, momentum is accelerating fast. Demand is rising as more traders realize this could be their last chance to get in below two-tenths of a cent. Why investors are rushing in now LILPEPE’s current price of $0.0018 will rise to $0.0019 in the next presale stage. This means those entering now are still at a strategic price point. As more centralized exchanges list the token and the $777K giveaway concludes, momentum is expected to surge. Presale buyers will also enjoy being first in line before large market-making campaigns begin post-launch. In a market where utility is becoming the buzzword, LILPEPE seems to be hitting the sweet spot. Investors are grabbing this hybrid that offers both meme virality and long-term growth. Final word: The next SHIB might not be a dog Crypto bull runs have always had their icons. In 2021, it was SHIB. In 2023, PEPE made a splash. But in 2025, Little Pepe might be the meme that defines the next wave of retail euphoria. With its blend of meme culture, real tech, and viral growth incentives, it isn’t just another frog on the blockchain — it’s potentially the future face of MemeFi. The presale is live. The token is under $0.002. The upside is still untouched. Don’t watch this one from the sidelines. Join the presale at littlepepe.com today.

2025-08-05 16:16:31,49590397,1754410591,Ripple Will Sneak XRP Into Banking Mainframe Via This Special Means,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to a segment of an official State Bank of India (SBI) document that discusses a growing trend among non-depository financial technology companies to seek entry into mainstream banking through regulatory channels, specifically the Special Purpose National Bank (SPNB) charter in the United States. The statement from SBI indicates that firms such as Ripple , Circle, Wise, and BitGo are among those pursuing SPNB charters, potentially enabling them to bypass traditional intermediary banks and integrate directly into the core infrastructure of the financial system. In a tweet quoting the material, SMQKE emphasized the implications of Ripple’s positioning, stating , “Ripple will ultimately sneak XRP into the banking mainframe through Special Purpose National Bank charter.” He cited the SBI text, which described the situation as a “mad rush” by crypto-related fintech firms to obtain SPNB status, which the document noted would allow them to “sneak into the mainframe banking while bypassing intermediary banks, all this with a stamp of legitimacy.” RIPPLE WILL ULTIMATELY SNEAK XRP INTO THE BANKING MAINFRAME THROUGH SPECIAL PURPOSE NATIONAL BANK CHARTER Read closely: “Interestingly, there is a mad rush by non-depository financial technology companies (crypto companies engaged in the business of banking), Ripple to… pic.twitter.com/qqE51YrNio — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 4, 2025 Ripple’s Banking Integration Strategy Through SPNB According to the slide from SBI’s presentation, the SPNB charter enables companies to operate as legitimate banking entities without the need to function as traditional depository institutions. For crypto-oriented companies like Ripple, acquiring such a charter could provide the regulatory cover needed to introduce digital assets into formal banking environments, including systems traditionally governed by federal and intermediary bank controls. By highlighting Ripple specifically, SBI recognizes the firm’s active involvement in financial infrastructure innovation. Ripple’s push for SPNB status may serve as a vehicle for deeper integration of digital asset services into the U.S. financial system. Although the SBI document refers to multiple companies, SMQKE’s interpretation centers on XRP as a likely beneficiary should Ripple successfully obtain the charter. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Potential for XRP’s Entry Into the Financial Core SMQKE’s framing aligns with ongoing discussions within the digital asset community about how XRP could activate its use cases across traditional finance. He underscores that Ripple’s ability to secure an SPNB charter could result in a legitimized route for XRP to be utilized within established banking systems, particularly by reducing reliance on intermediaries. A related comment from crypto commentator BD InTheHouse added a conditional note of optimism, stating: “Although ‘approval’ is not guaranteed… when/if it does, and you are holding XRP , you will change the lives of many in your family.” While this remark emphasizes the potential value shift XRP holders anticipate, it also acknowledges the uncertainty of regulatory outcomes. Regulatory Path Remains Uncertain but Strategically Significant Though the SBI document confirms the existence of a concerted push among fintech companies for SPNB charters, the success of any individual firm’s application—including Ripple’s—remains subject to approval by U.S. regulatory authorities. The document does not state that any of the mentioned companies have been granted a charter. But it does identify the trend as significant in the context of broader regulatory developments such as the GENIUS Act , the SEC and CFTC’s evolving role in digital asset oversight, and Executive Order 14178 on strengthening U.S. leadership in digital financial technology. SMQKE’s analysis highlights what he views as a quiet but strategic move by Ripple that may allow XRP to gain a foothold within the banking system under regulatory legitimacy. As U.S. policy continues to evolve in response to innovation in digital finance, the outcome of these charter applications will likely have wide-reaching consequences for the adoption and utility of digital assets such as XRP.

Sanctions include website blocks and app restrictions on illegal crypto platforms. SEC will ask tech giants to remove ads promoting unlicensed crypto services. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines has warned the public against dealing with unlicensed crypto exchanges. The list includes platforms such as OKX, Bybit, MEXC, and others. The SEC of the Philippines launched a campaign in March 2024 against platforms illegally providing crypto asset services. At that time, local exchanges such as MiTrade and OctaFX were banned. Sanctions against these platforms included restrictions on access to their websites and mobile applications. Binance was later sanctioned as well. In a recent release, the SEC stated it found other crypto exchanges continuing to operate in the country without a license. Similar measures will be taken against them. The regulator pointed out the lack of proper control measures on these platforms, including anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures. Users were warned not to trade or store crypto assets on these exchanges. As part of the restrictive measures, the SEC plans to request blocking of the websites and applications of these exchanges. It will also contact Google, Apple, and other major platforms to remove advertising content related to these services. The SEC urges investors to conduct thorough due diligence before engaging with any crypto platform to avoid potential scams. It also encourages the reporting of suspicious platforms to help protect the public from financial risks.",News|Legal,EN,0,philippine sec warns unlicensed crypto exchange like okx bybit mexc sanction include website block app restriction illegal crypto platform sec ask tech giant remove ad promoting unlicensed crypto service security exchange commission sec philippine warned public dealing unlicensed crypto exchange list includes platform okx bybit mexc others sec philippine launched campaign march platform illegally providing crypto asset service time local exchange mitrade octafx banned sanction platform included restriction access website mobile application binance later sanctioned well recent release sec stated found crypto exchange continuing operate country without license similar measure taken regulator pointed lack proper control measure platform including laundering aml financing measure user warned trade store crypto asset exchange part restrictive measure sec plan request blocking website application exchange also contact google apple major platform remove advertising content related service sec urge investor conduct thorough due diligence engaging crypto platform avoid potential scam also encourages reporting suspicious platform help protect public financial risk,0.179,0.661,0.16,-0.4019,0
2025-08-05 16:15:00,1527797,1754410500,Chainlink price prediction 2025-2031: A strong buy sentiment for LINK?,"Key takeaways Chainlink could reach a maximum value of $21.53 in 2025.

Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $16.3 Market Cap $11.43B Trading Volume (24-hour) $609.59 Circulating Supply 678.09M LINK All-time High $52.88, May 09, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263, Sep 23, 2017 24-hour High $17.18 24-hour Low $16.25 Chainlink price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price prediction $ 17.85 (6.26%) Price Volatility (30-day variation) 10.95% 50-day SMA $ 15.52 14-day RSI 52.12 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 60(Greed) Green days 19/30 (63%) 200-day SMA $ 13.84 Chainlink price analysis: LINK struggles below resistance amid market volatility Strong resistance at $17.18: LINK struggles to break above this level, showing persistent selling pressure. Support at $15.5 holds: Buyers are defending this level, preventing a deeper drop. Range-bound movement: LINK remains stuck between $16.47 and $17.18, signaling market indecision. On August 5, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $16.34, reflecting a daily drop of 2.24%. The price is currently fluctuating between a defined resistance level at $17.18 and support at $15.5, showing a limited trading range throughout the session. The market has entered a state of short-term indecision as the token lacks significant momentum to break out in either direction. Chainlink 1-day price chart: LINK trapped between strong resistance and support Chainlink’s 1-day chart shows the asset moving sideways with $17.18 as a key resistance and $15.5 acting as firm support. The price opened at $16.63 and briefly tested higher levels before retracing. After reaching nearly $17.00, LINK faced intense selling pressure and declined back to current levels around $16.34. The support at $15.54 has been tested but held, showing buying interest at lower levels. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The daily RSI is neutral, hovering around the 47 mark, suggesting no clear momentum. The trading volume has declined, confirming a lack of participation from both buyers and sellers. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are flat, showing no trend dominance. LINK’s lower highs and consistent rejections around the $17.00-$17.18 zone highlight strong selling zones. A daily close above $17.18 is necessary to break out of this range, while a dip below $15.5 could open a move down toward $14.71. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK price action weakens below mid-range During the 4-hour timeframe, LINK attempted to rally above $17.00 but failed to sustain gains and quickly retraced. The intraday peak was rejected, and the price dropped below $16.5, highlighting weak short-term bullish momentum. Price action indicates hesitation near resistance levels with increasing pressure from sellers. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView Support remains steady at $16, but momentum indicators show fading strength. The 4-hour RSI is sloping downward, suggesting weakness in buying pressure. Without volume confirmation and bullish continuation, the asset remains vulnerable to short-term pullbacks. Any 4-hour close below $15.5 would expose LINK to downside risks. Chainlink technical indicators: levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 14.91 BUY SMA 5 $ 15.88 BUY SMA 10 $ 17.19 SELL SMA 21 $ 17.84 SELL SMA 50 $ 15.52 BUY SMA 100 $ 15.28 BUY SMA 200 $ 13.84 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 16.72 BUY EMA 5 $ 16.08 BUY EMA 10 $ 15.21 BUY EMA 21 $ 14.57 BUY EMA 50 $ 14.98 BUY EMA 100 $ 16.19 BUY EMA 200 $ 16.56 BUY What to expect from Chainlink? Chainlink (LINK) is currently consolidating in a narrow range between $15.5 support and $17.18 resistance, with no clear breakout in sight. The market shows hesitation, and unless the price decisively breaks above resistance or falls below support, sideways action is likely to continue in the short term. If buyers push above $17.18, LINK could target $17.50 and beyond, potentially shifting market sentiment. However, if support at $15.5 fails, downside risk increases, and the next key level to watch would be around $14.71. Traders should remain cautious and watch for a confirmed breakout from the current range before considering directional plays. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink (LINK) remains a fundamentally strong project with a critical role in the blockchain ecosystem, providing secure and reliable oracle services for smart contracts. Its technology is widely adopted across DeFi, gaming, insurance, and enterprise use cases, with continued integration into both on-chain and off-chain systems. However, from a short-term trading perspective, LINK is currently in a sideways range and lacks momentum, which may not offer immediate gains. Investors with a long-term horizon may find value in LINK’s utility and network growth, but short-term traders should wait for a clear breakout above $17.18 or breakdown below $15.5 before acting. As always, investment decisions should be based on a combination of technical analysis, fundamental research, and personal risk tolerance. Why is the LINK price down today? The decline in Chainlink (LINK) to $16.3 today, August 5, 2025, is primarily driven by technical rejection at the $17.00–$17.18 resistance zone. Despite attempts to climb higher, sellers have consistently stepped in near this level, pushing the price back down. This repeated failure to break resistance has weakened bullish momentum. Additionally, overall market indecision and low trading volume are contributing to LINK’s inability to sustain upward moves. With no major bullish catalysts or breakout patterns, traders appear cautious, leading to range-bound price action and minor intraday pullbacks. Will Chainlink reach $50? Based on long-term forecasts, Chainlink (LINK) is projected to reach $50 by 2028, indicating potential future price movements as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Chainlink reach $100? Chainlink can reach $100 in the year 2030, per expert predictions. Does Chainlink have a promising long-term future? Chainlink shows some stabilization and potential for recovery, indicating the token may have a promising long-term future.

The token recovered during the weekend and trimmed its 7-day losses. However, it is still the second-worst-performing token of the top 10 on a year-to-date basis as it has shed 11% of its value. High volumes at these low prices may indicate whale accumulation at a point when favorable regulations in the United States could propel the price of ADA in the future. Recently, Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, said that ADA was a better investment than BTC as the former offers a much higher upside potential due to its smaller market cap and progressively developing use cases. $ADA monstrous cup and handle! whales are done accumulating #Cardano Breakout target: $0.92 → $4.00+ pic.twitter.com/kb4rghM3G4 — Smith (@CryptoSmith0x) July 29, 2025 Meanwhile, Crypto Trader CryptoSmith0x, whose X account is followed by more than 28,000 users, sees the token rising to $4 as ADA has broken a long-standing accumulation. This period of consolidation has been going on for nearly 5 years and ended in 2025 as ADA jumped to $1. A breakout could set off a move toward the $3 level over the next 3 to 6 months. This trader’s bullish Cardano price prediction sees the token retesting its all-time high from September 2021 at some point during that period. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Recovers Upon Hitting Key Support at $0.69 ADA has been on a downtrend since it hit $0.935 back in late July. The price has made multiple consecutive lower highs and now seems headed to retest its trend line resistance from below. The token has also entered a key area of resistance at $0.75 that will be critical to determine where the price could be headed next. With trading volumes rising alongside buying interest, the odds favor a bullish Cardano price prediction that pushes the asset above this key level and toward a breakout of this descending triangle. If ADA hits $0.80, that would confirm a trend reversal is occurring and would set things in motion for a much stronger move toward $0.86 and $0.95 afterward. As top cryptos like ADA eye new highs, storing these assets safely is a key priority.

2025-08-05 06:10:10,49565687,1754374210,Unveiling Critical BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling Critical BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Understanding the pulse of the cryptocurrency market is crucial for any trader or investor. One of the most telling indicators of market sentiment, especially for Bitcoin, comes from analyzing BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios. These ratios offer a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate price increases (longs) or decreases (shorts). What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Reveal? For those engaged in crypto trading , knowing the collective leanings of the market can provide a significant edge. The long-short ratio essentially compares the number of long positions to short positions on perpetual futures contracts. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 points to more short positions, indicating bearish sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures across various exchanges shows a slight lean towards short positions. The total ratio stands at: Total: Long 49.47%, Short 50.53% This suggests that, overall, a marginally larger percentage of traders are betting on a downward price movement for Bitcoin in the immediate future. Analyzing Current Market Sentiment: Why It Matters for Crypto Trading Gauging market sentiment is not just an academic exercise; it has practical implications for your trading strategy. When the market is predominantly short, it might signal potential capitulation or, conversely, an opportunity for a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly reverse. Conversely, a heavily long market could be ripe for a correction. It is important to remember that these ratios represent aggregated positions and do not necessarily predict future price movements with certainty. However, they do reflect the current psychological state of the market participants, which can often influence short-term trends. Monitoring these shifts helps traders adapt their strategies. Diving Deeper into Bitcoin Derivatives: Exchange-Specific Insights While the overall picture gives us a broad understanding, examining individual exchanges provides a more granular view of Bitcoin derivatives activity. Different exchanges attract different types of traders, and their specific ratios can sometimes reveal localized trends or the influence of larger players on a particular platform. Here are the 24-hour long-short ratios for three prominent exchanges: Binance: Long 48.78%, Short 51.22% Bybit: Long 47.03%, Short 52.97% Gate.io: Long 49.20%, Short 50.80% Notice that Bybit shows the strongest short bias among the top three, indicating a more bearish outlook from its user base compared to Binance or Gate.io. This variance highlights the diverse trading behaviors across platforms, which is crucial for comprehensive market analysis. Actionable Insights from Futures Contracts Data What can you do with this information about futures contracts ? Firstly, use it as a complementary tool, not a standalone indicator. Combine long-short ratios with technical analysis, on-chain data, and macroeconomic factors for a more robust trading plan. Secondly, be aware of extremes. Historically, extreme long or short biases have sometimes preceded market reversals. If everyone is on one side of the trade, the potential for a swift move in the opposite direction increases. For instance, a sudden shift from a heavily short-biased market to a more balanced or even long-biased one could signal a change in momentum. Conversely, if short positions continue to dominate, it might confirm a prevailing bearish trend, prompting caution for those considering long entries. Navigating the Dynamics of BTC Perpetual Futures The world of BTC perpetual futures is dynamic and constantly evolving. Staying informed about these crucial metrics helps you navigate its complexities. Understanding who is long and who is short provides a valuable lens through which to view potential price action and market sentiment shifts. Always conduct your own research and consider multiple data points before making any trading decisions. By regularly reviewing long-short ratios, you empower yourself with a deeper understanding of the collective market psychology, enabling more informed and potentially more profitable crypto trading strategies. This data is a powerful tool for anticipating market shifts and managing risk effectively. In conclusion, the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a vital snapshot of current market sentiment. While the slight short bias across major exchanges indicates a cautious outlook, understanding these dynamics on an exchange-specific level provides deeper insights. Utilize this data as part of a comprehensive analysis to enhance your decision-making in the volatile crypto markets. Staying informed about these metrics is key to successful trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a long-short ratio in crypto trading? The long-short ratio compares the total number of open long positions (bets on price increase) to open short positions (bets on price decrease) for a specific cryptocurrency on derivatives exchanges. It indicates prevailing market sentiment. Why are BTC perpetual futures important for market analysis? BTC perpetual futures are widely traded derivatives that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price without owning the underlying asset. Their long-short ratios provide a real-time gauge of bullish or bearish sentiment among a large segment of crypto traders. How do different exchanges’ long-short ratios vary? Long-short ratios can vary significantly between exchanges due to differences in user bases, liquidity, and regional trading preferences. Analyzing these individual exchange ratios can reveal specific trading behaviors and localized sentiment trends. Can long-short ratios predict future Bitcoin price movements? While long-short ratios are strong indicators of current market sentiment, they are not direct predictors of future price movements. They are best used as a complementary tool alongside technical analysis, on-chain data, and other fundamental factors to form a comprehensive trading strategy. What does a higher short percentage mean for BTC perpetual futures? A higher short percentage, as seen in the recent data, indicates that a larger proportion of traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to fall. This suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term, though extreme biases can sometimes precede reversals. Found this analysis of BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios insightful?

2025-08-05 06:00:29,49565251,1754373629,Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer,"After falling below a crucial support level, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to recover some of its lost ground. An analyst suggested that this week’s performance will be decisive for the cryptocurrency’s next trend. Related Reading: Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is Headed For $9,000 After This Broadening Wedge Retest Bitcoin Loses Bull Flag Formation Over the weekend, Bitcoin lost its post-breakout range for the first time in three weeks, falling to a local low of $112,296 on August 3. The flagship crypto had been trading between the $114,000-$120,000 range since the early July breakout, hitting its all-time high (ATH) of $122,838 amid the rally. As July neared its end, BTC experienced some volatility, retesting the range lows twice over its last week. However, the cryptocurrency was unable to repeat its price recovery from the previous weekend, losing the crucial area on August 1. Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin’s rally could be at risk, explaining that BTC has formed a bull flag in the weekly chart and held the pattern’s lows as support until the latest Weekly Close. Following its recent price action, the analyst considers that this week’s performance will be pivotal to see whether the pattern’s bottom, around the $117,200 area, will become a new resistance and confirm the breakdown, or if the flagship crypto’s price will recover the structure. According to the analysis, if the price can reclaim the structure, the correction would be considered a fake downside deviation before resynchronizing with the pattern. Meanwhile, turning the pattern’s bottom into resistance would be a bearish retest, confirming the breakdown, and potentially leading to a new retest of the $112,000 area as support. BTC’s Weekly Close To Determine Next Trend Rekt Capital also detailed that this week’s performance will determine the future of BTC’s second Price Discovery uptrend, which has technically started its fifth week. Depending on what happens to the Bull Flag (reclaim or a confirmation of the breakdown), we will know whether the Price Discovery Uptrend 2 will continue or whether BTC has experienced a very short PDU2 instead. Last week, the analyst retesting that the continuation of the Price Discovery trend could fail as BTC transitioned into weeks 5-7 of this phase. Historically, the second uptrend has started to slow down around Weeks 5-6, hitting its peak during this “Danger Zone.” If Bitcoin reclaims the Bull Flag and challenges new highs, then its second Price Discovery uptrend will progress according to its historical tendencies. However, if it fails to Weekly Close above the pattern’s bottom and confirms additional downside, the second Price Discovery uptrend would have ended in Week 2, much quicker than has historically been the case. Moreover, it would reveal that BTC has been in its second Price Discovery Correction, which “would be going completely against the grain of history.” Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level The analyst suggested that macro-wise, Bitcoin still has plenty of time for a third Price Discovery uptrend. If the second phase has already ended, a final uptrend could overcompensate for the current uptrend’s underperformance. Previously, Rekt Capital asserted that what comes after the second uptrend would depend on how long the corrective phase takes, as a shot correction could allow for a third uptrend before the bear market.

2025-08-05 06:00:07,49565172,1754373607,Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With Massive Third-Largest Acquisition,"Michael Saylor’s enterprise software company, Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), has made headlines once again with a substantial Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition, pushing its total holdings beyond 600,000 coins. The company purchased an impressive $2.46 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past week, marking its third-largest purchase by dollar amount since it began acquiring the digital asset five years ago. Bitcoin Acquisition At Record Prices Between July 28 and August 3, Strategy added 21,021 Bitcoin to its holdings, bringing its total to 628,791 tokens. At current market prices, the firm’s portfolio is valued at over $71 billion. Saylor has adeptly transformed his company from a traditional software provider into the leading corporate buyer of Bitcoin, utilizing innovative financial strategies to fuel these purchases. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ The latest acquisition was made at an average price of $117,526 per token, which is the second-highest price the company has ever paid, just shy of the $118,940 average from the previous month. Strategy is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. BTC mining company MARA Holdings is second with 50,000 coins, which highlights Saylor’s firm’s purchasing power. Notably, this position has not only solidified Saylor’s influence in the crypto space but has also inspired other public companies to adopt similar treasury strategies aimed at accumulating and holding digital currencies. These include Trump’s social media company, boosted by a new regulatory regime and legislation in the US aimed at positioning the country as the crypto capital of the world, a mission that President Donald Trump has advocated since his election campaign last year. Saylor’s Strategy Pledges To Protect Shareholder Value To fund these massive purchases, Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor has employed a mix of common and preferred share sales alongside debt instruments. Recently, the company launched its latest preferred stock offering, dubbed “Stretch,” in late July. In its second-quarter report, Strategy announced an unrealized gain of $14 billion, primarily driven by the recent rebound in Bitcoin prices and a new accounting requirement that necessitated the revaluation of its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor has also made a commitment to investors, stating that he will refrain from issuing new common shares at less than 2.5 times the company’s net asset value, except for covering debt interest or preferred dividends. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level This pledge comes in light of concerns raised by critics like Jim Chanos, who have expressed apprehension about the premium that Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings place on its share price and the numerous securities offerings the company has executed. Since its initial foray into Bitcoin, Strategy’s stock, MSTR, has skyrocketed over 3,000%, significantly outperforming Bitcoin itself and major stock indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. The company’s largest purchases occurred in November, totaling $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, demonstrating Saylor’s aggressive strategy in the cryptocurrency market. However, on Monday, the firm did not disclose any further purchases, as it has commonly done over the past few months. Perhaps it is starting to reassess its direction with biweekly acquisitions. It remains to be seen what the firm’s next moves will be, as there have been no further official comments on the matter.

CEO Shin Jin-wook already faces a 7-year sentence in prison for stealing 10 billion won ($7.5 million) worth of customer deposits. South Korean media outlet Digital Asset reported that a Daegu District Court judge sentenced Shin for his alleged involvement in Bitsonic Coin (BSC) fraud. CEO Admits to Bitsonic Coin Fraud The CEO defrauded customers for a total of 160 million won ($115K) “by inflating BSC trading volume and market price after inducing transactions through false announcements,” the verdict noted. Shin used false KRW points obtained via buybacks to purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum from members. He later converted the digital assets into cash and invested in firms unrelated to the exchange, it added. Additionally, he falsified the lockup period, only to discover that neither the investment nor interest could be returned to investors. “Although Mr. Shin was unable to reach an agreement with the victims, he admitted his wrongdoing and is reflecting on it,” said Judge Seong Gi-jun. “The sentencing conditions, including the motive and circumstances of the crime, were taken into consideration when determining the sentence.” Here’s How Bitsonic Chiefs Landed in “Lenient” Sentences In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic’s chief technology officer, surnamed Bae, were sentenced to a combined 8 years in prison for manipulating crypto prices and hugely profiting from them. Per a Seoul District Court, Shin had “reached an agreement with two of the victims who suffered the largest amount of damages,” at the time. Further, neither CEO Shin nor Bae had a history of committing similar types of crime, the Judge noted. This led the Judge to sentence both Bitsonic chiefs to a “lenient” sentence. Besides, under South Korean law, defendants can appeal guilty verdicts and sentences at the High Court and the Supreme Court.

The TD Sequential indicator flashed a sell signal on the three-day chart, suggesting a short-term top may be forming. News Background The price spike followed a broader risk-on move in crypto markets as traders rotated out of lower-cap altcoins and into high-liquidity majors. However, on-chain data revealed aggressive sell-side flows from whale addresses and smart money funds—raising concerns that the rally may have been driven by short-term positioning ahead of regulatory catalysts. The SEC is expected to clarify XRP’s securities treatment by mid-August, a potential binary event for the token. Price Action Summary XRP hit intraday highs of $3.08 before fading slightly to close the session at $3.05. Price action reversed sharply at $3.09, establishing the level as near-term resistance. Support was observed at $2.97 during the 05:00–06:00 window, with back-to-back volumes of 57.65 million and 44.77 million. The final hour saw a $0.01 range between $3.04 and $3.05 with high intrabar volatility and no clear directional bias. Technical Analysis Price held above the $3.00 psychological zone but failed to break higher despite massive volume surges. TD Sequential shows a 9-count sell signal on 3D, typically followed by consolidation or downside pressure. RSI on the 1H and 4H remains elevated but has not crossed into extreme overbought territory. The $3.09 rejection came on 69.89 million volume, well above the 24H average of 62.11 million. What Traders Are Watching Whether XRP can maintain support above $3.00 heading into the weekend.

2025-08-05 05:45:30,49564651,1754372730,Top Analyst Forecasts Just Dropped – 7 Best Cryptos to Watch in 2025,"What if the next wealth-shifting crypto wasn’t already on everyone’s radar? Meme coins have graduated from joke status to serious financial contenders. Investors across the globe are now seeing these viral tokens turn modest entries into portfolio-transforming moves. This wave isn’t slowing – it’s gaining speed, traction, and attention. Among this evolving pack, one name stands tall with a strategic edge. The MoonBull Whitelist is now live, offering early access to those watching closely. This rare chance opens the gates to what could be one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025, alongside an exciting new generation of meme-driven assets including Fartcoin, Degen, ANDY, Osaka Protocol, Test, and Coq Inu. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Strategic Entry Point Investors Crave The MoonBull Whitelist is now open, sparking a wave of urgency among smart crypto enthusiasts. This Ethereum-based meme coin has engineered a limited early-access model that positions its supporters for maximum leverage. With only a finite number of whitelist slots, timing becomes the ultimate edge. Whitelist members unlock privileged access before the presale opens to the public. They receive the lowest possible token entry price, secret staking reward opportunities, exclusive token drops, and roadmap hints unavailable to outsiders. Each benefit is tailored to empower early supporters before the crypto world catches on. When Early Access Pays Off: A Look at Prior Whitelist Victories Human behavior is wired to seek exclusivity. Scarcity fuels action, especially when rewards are hidden behind a countdown. The MoonBull Whitelist taps into this psychology masterfully. The desire to be first, the stress of missing out, and the rush of privilege create an emotional loop that compels immediate action. In 2021, early participants in Shiba Inu’s public trading phase saw unprecedented gains, with some wallets witnessing over 100,000% increases according to blockchain analytics from Etherscan and CoinGecko historical data. Likewise, Floki Inu’s early backers gained significant value during its viral expansion phase, with multiple wallet addresses multiplying their holdings in weeks, as tracked by BscScan and major price aggregators. The history of early access yielding oversized returns is well-documented – and MoonBull’s current whitelist strategy positions it to potentially follow a similar trajectory. This strategic architecture, paired with Ethereum’s rock-solid DeFi base, places MoonBull among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 2. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): A Token That Breaks the Rules Fartcoin began as a laugh, but today it’s commanding serious attention. Built around shock value and unapologetic meme energy, this coin is dominating online traffic across Reddit, Telegram, and TikTok. Its strong community and viral spread give it the kind of grassroots fuel that meme coins thrive on. The tokenomics offer an aggressive burn model and redistribution incentives that reward long-term holders. With each transaction, a portion is burned, creating scarcity, while holders receive small rewards, encouraging retention. That duality – deflation and passive income – is what draws savvy investors. More than just a meme, Fartcoin is expanding its use cases in gaming and tipping platforms, adding long-term potential to its marketability. Its unconventional branding makes it stand out, but its strong fundamentals place it confidently among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 3. Degen ($DEGEN): The Community-First Coin With Powerhouse Energy Degen is not just a coin – it’s an identity. Crafted for high-risk traders and internet-native investors, $DEGEN celebrates the chaotic charm of crypto culture. Its launch was one of the most talked-about entries of Q2, with over 100,000 holders in its first 48 hours. The project’s roadmap includes community voting tools, staking pools, and exclusive NFT collaborations. A DAO-based structure ensures that major decisions lie in the hands of its most loyal users. The inclusivity model adds legitimacy, pulling more people into the fold. Degen’s marketing strategy focuses heavily on virality, gamification, and influencer partnerships, fueling further momentum. The coin’s ability to convert raw culture into real value has made it a front-runner among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 4. ANDY ($ANDY): The Cultural Meme That’s Winning Big Support $ANDY has gained significant traction as the meme coin that blends culture, nostalgia, and social media flair. Inspired by quirky internet characters and powered by a community of content creators, its engagement rates outpace many mid-cap tokens. The token is deflationary with a capped supply, and its roadmap includes creator-centric initiatives like exclusive merchandise and fan-driven project expansions. With mainstream appeal and the ability to draw in both crypto natives and pop culture fans, ANDY has carved out a lane of its own. The coin’s fast-rising market cap, driven largely by online influencers and YouTube communities, hints at untapped potential. This digital blend of personality and performance ensures ANDY’s place among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 5. Osaka Protocol ($OSAK): The Underdog Protocol With Big-Budget Vision Osaka Protocol enters the meme space with technical depth and a long-term playbook. Built on a hybrid Ethereum layer-2 model, $OSAK focuses on combining meme momentum with security and scalability. The protocol introduces smart contract features tailored for meme coin ecosystems, including a secure staking model and on-chain voting. It plans integrations with major DeFi platforms and DEXs to extend token utility. Its whitepaper reveals serious intent – a rarity in the meme space. Backed by an anonymous but verified dev team and multiple audits, Osaka has found favor with those who value both credibility and virality. These strategic advantages solidify its inclusion as one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 6. Test ($TST): This Coin Challenges Definitions Test started as a joke – a coin literally called Test – but its simplicity and irony sparked curiosity. That curiosity snowballed into one of the fastest-growing Telegram groups in the meme coin space. The $TST token is used in experimental NFT drops and community challenges that reward both participation and loyalty. Its gamified structure and unpredictable campaigns keep users engaged daily. With a flexible framework and a knack for surprise, Test proves that the unexpected often outperforms the over-engineered. Its rapid growth and social experimentation make Test a wild card among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 7. Coq Inu ($COQ): High Engagement Meets High Volume Coq Inu blends meme aesthetics with tokenomics designed for volume. With over 150,000 holders and rising liquidity, $COQ is proving that meme coins can hold weight over time. It runs on a reflection-based system, where holders receive passive income in $COQ tokens from every transaction. Paired with marketing campaigns that include Twitter raids and celebrity shoutouts, the momentum is undeniable. The roadmap teases future metaverse integrations and limited-time burns, increasing scarcity while maintaining virality. Coq Inu’s ability to keep up with evolving market trends locks its status as one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. Conclusion: What This All Means for 2025 Based on the latest research, the best cryptos to watch in 2025 include MoonBull, Fartcoin, Degen, ANDY, Osaka Protocol, Test, and Coq Inu. Each of these projects represents a different angle of meme coin dominance, from community-first to deflationary supply models and creator-centric ecosystems. MoonBull stands apart with its exclusive whitelist mechanics, early supporter rewards, and Ethereum foundation. While others bring volume, culture, and innovation, Moon Bull fuses all three with high-stakes entry mechanics designed to favor the early movers.

2025-08-05 05:40:10,49564368,1754372410,Revolutionary Stablecoin Pre-Paid Cards: Danal Powers Korea’s Seamless Crypto Payments,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Stablecoin Pre-Paid Cards: Danal Powers Korea’s Seamless Crypto Payments Imagine a world where using cryptocurrency for everyday purchases is as simple as swiping a card. That future is rapidly approaching in South Korea, thanks to a groundbreaking initiative by Danal. This prominent South Korean payments firm, known for its cryptocurrency Paycoin (PCI), is set to revolutionize how foreigners spend money in the country by introducing stablecoin pre-paid cards . This innovative step marks a significant leap forward in making digital assets truly usable in daily life, addressing a critical need for seamless international transactions. What Makes These Stablecoin Pre-Paid Cards a Game Changer? Danal’s ambitious plan involves integrating stablecoins directly into pre-paid cards specifically designed for foreign visitors and residents in South Korea. Set to launch in the third quarter of this year, this initiative is monumental. It will be the very first time a Korean company enables direct stablecoin payments through a card product. This pioneering move addresses a crucial need, considering that foreign visitors spent an astonishing 56 trillion won ($40.3 billion) using pre-paid cards in South Korea during 2023 alone, according to the Migration Research and Training Centre (MRTC). The introduction of these cards means foreigners can potentially bypass complex currency exchange processes, which often involve unfavorable rates and additional fees. Instead, they can convert their stablecoins into local currency on the card, making transactions seamless and more cost-effective. This innovation simplifies spending and significantly enhances convenience for a large and economically vital demographic. How Will Danal Stablecoin Cards Operate for Users? While specific technical details are still emerging, the core concept revolves around leveraging stablecoins for everyday transactions. Danal has already laid some strategic groundwork, including recent trademark filings related to stablecoins, which clearly indicate their long-term commitment to this transformative technology. The integration will likely involve a user-friendly application or platform where individuals can load their stablecoins onto the card. At the point of sale, the system would then convert the stablecoin holdings into the required fiat currency (Korean Won), allowing users to spend as they would with any traditional pre-paid card. For existing users of Paycoin, Danal’s own cryptocurrency, this development could also mean enhanced utility and a more direct pathway to spending their digital assets. The firm’s deep roots in the crypto space suggest a smooth and intuitive transition for those already familiar with digital assets. These crypto payment cards are designed to bridge the gap between the volatile digital asset world and the stability of traditional commerce, offering a practical, real-world solution for millions. Boosting Accessibility with Korean Stablecoin Payments The implications of Danal’s initiative extend far beyond mere transactional convenience. By offering accessible Korean stablecoin payments via widely accepted pre-paid cards, Danal is actively promoting the mainstream adoption of digital currencies. This strategic move can significantly lower the barrier to entry for individuals who might be hesitant to use cryptocurrencies directly due to perceived complexity or volatility, but who are perfectly comfortable with familiar card-based transactions. Furthermore, this development showcases South Korea’s progressive stance on financial innovation and its willingness to embrace cutting-edge technologies. This pioneering effort could inspire other companies globally to explore similar solutions, fostering a more interconnected and digitally-enabled global economy. The potential for broader Paycoin integration into various payment ecosystems also grows significantly, solidifying its position as a practical digital currency. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Considerations The introduction of these cards brings numerous advantages: Seamless Transactions: Foreigners can avoid high foreign exchange fees and the hassle of physical currency conversion, making their visits more enjoyable and economical. Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins become genuinely practical for everyday spending, moving beyond speculative investment. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Leveraging blockchain technology for underlying transactions can offer improved security and auditability. Broader Adoption: This initiative encourages wider acceptance and understanding of digital assets among the general public and merchants. Economic Boost: By simplifying spending for foreigners, it could further stimulate the tourism and retail sectors. However, like any innovative leap, there are considerations: Regulatory Clarity: Navigating evolving cryptocurrency regulations in South Korea and internationally will be crucial for long-term success. User Education: Ensuring users fully understand how to manage their stablecoin holdings and card usage, including any potential fees or limits, is vital. Merchant Acceptance: While the cards function like regular pre-paid cards, ensuring widespread merchant understanding and acceptance is key. Danal’s venture into stablecoin pre-paid cards is a bold and strategic step, positioning them at the forefront of crypto innovation in the global payment sector. It highlights a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into our financial routines. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Payments Begins Danal’s launch of Korea’s first stablecoin pre-paid cards represents a pivotal moment for digital payments worldwide. This groundbreaking initiative not only simplifies financial transactions for foreigners in South Korea but also sets a powerful precedent for how stablecoins can integrate into mainstream commerce globally. By effectively bridging the gap between digital currencies and traditional spending habits, Danal is paving the way for a more accessible, efficient, and technologically advanced financial future. This development profoundly underscores the growing utility and practical applications of stablecoins, further highlighting South Korea’s significant role as a leader in fintech innovation and the practical adoption of blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are stablecoin pre-paid cards? A: Stablecoin pre-paid cards are payment cards that allow users to spend stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar) for everyday purchases. The cards convert the stablecoin into local fiat currency at the point of sale. Q2: Who is Danal and what is Paycoin? A: Danal is a major South Korean payments firm.

Crypto users are currently buzzing about a significant announcement from Binance regarding USDC withdrawals . The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, recently informed its users about a temporary suspension of USDC withdrawals on several popular blockchain networks. This move is a direct result of scheduled wallet maintenance, a routine but crucial part of ensuring the platform’s stability and security. Why Are USDC Withdrawals Temporarily Paused on Binance? Binance announced on its official website that it will temporarily suspend USDC withdrawals across five prominent networks. These include Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Optimism (OP). The suspension is set to begin at 07:00 UTC on August 6. The primary reason for this temporary halt is scheduled wallet maintenance. Think of it like essential roadwork – inconvenient for a short period, but vital for long-term smooth operation. Ethereum (ETH): A foundational blockchain, widely used for DeFi and NFTs. Polygon (POL): A popular Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, known for lower fees. Arbitrum (ARB): Another leading Layer-2 solution, enhancing Ethereum’s scalability. Base (BASE): Coinbase’s new Ethereum Layer-2, gaining traction. Optimism (OP): A robust Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, focusing on speed and cost-efficiency. This proactive step by Binance highlights its commitment to maintaining a secure and efficient trading environment. Such planned maintenance activities are standard practice within the industry to upgrade systems, enhance security protocols, and improve overall service reliability. While a temporary inconvenience, it ultimately benefits users by ensuring the integrity of their assets. Understanding the Impact of Binance USDC Suspension A temporary Binance USDC suspension might raise questions for users, but it is important to understand its nature. This is not a halt to all USDC transactions on Binance, but specifically withdrawals on the listed networks. Users can still trade USDC on the exchange and potentially withdraw via other available networks if supported. However, for those relying on these specific chains for their USDC movements, planning is key. The impact is largely limited to the withdrawal function for a specific stablecoin on particular networks. It is a brief pause, not a permanent change. Binance aims to complete this wallet maintenance efficiently, restoring full withdrawal capabilities as soon as possible. Keeping an eye on Binance’s official announcements will provide the most accurate updates regarding the resumption of services. This event serves as a reminder for all crypto users about the importance of diversification in their asset management strategies. Relying on a single network or exchange for all operations can sometimes lead to temporary disruptions. Always consider having multiple avenues for managing your digital assets. Navigating Stablecoin Withdrawal Issues: What Users Should Know When facing stablecoin withdrawal issues , staying calm and informed is crucial. First, always check the official announcements from the crypto exchange. Binance, for instance, communicates such updates clearly on its website and social media channels. During periods of wallet maintenance Binance undertakes, it’s best to avoid initiating withdrawals on the affected networks to prevent potential delays or complications. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Updated: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements page or their social media for real-time updates on the maintenance status. Consider Alternatives: If urgent USDC transfers are needed, explore if Binance supports withdrawals on other networks not affected by this maintenance. Alternatively, consider converting USDC to another stablecoin or cryptocurrency that is available for withdrawal on your preferred network, if that aligns with your strategy. Plan Ahead: For future transactions, be aware that scheduled maintenance can occur. Planning your withdrawals in advance can help avoid last-minute inconveniences. These temporary measures are a testament to the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. A proactive approach from a leading crypto exchange updates its infrastructure to ensure long-term stability and security for its users. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Exchange Updates? This incident underscores the ongoing need for crypto exchanges to perform regular maintenance. As blockchain technology evolves, so too must the infrastructure supporting it. Such planned downtimes are a sign of a mature platform committed to security and efficiency. Users can expect more transparent communication around these events, which helps build trust and understanding within the community. It reinforces the idea that even in the fast-paced world of crypto, careful and deliberate operational management is paramount. In conclusion, Binance’s temporary suspension of USDC withdrawals on select networks for scheduled wallet maintenance is a routine yet vital operational decision. While it requires users to adjust their plans temporarily, it ultimately contributes to a more secure and reliable crypto ecosystem. Staying informed and understanding the reasons behind such actions empowers users to navigate the crypto landscape with confidence. This commitment to robust infrastructure ensures a safer environment for everyone involved in digital asset transactions.

2025-08-05 05:30:00,49564008,1754371800,George Osborne Warns UK Is Losing Crypto Edge,"In a Financial Times op-ed, Osborne explained that the UK risks losing its status as a financial leader while the US advances through initiatives like the GENIUS Act. Osborne criticized Chancellor Rachel Reeves and supported Coinbase’s controversial ad campaign, which mocked the UK’s economic stagnation and pointed to crypto as an alternative. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act itself is under scrutiny in the US for banning yield-bearing stablecoins. Critics say this favors traditional banks and undermines stablecoin innovation. Other experts argue that tokenized money market funds may benefit, but stablecoins still hold an edge in DeFi. UK Missing Crypto Opportunity George Osborne, the former UK chancellor and now adviser to Coinbase, issued a stark warning that the United Kingdom is falling behind in the digital asset race, particularly in the stablecoin sector. In a recent Financial Times op-ed , Osborne voiced his concerns over the UK’s sluggish progress in adopting crypto-friendly policies, and argued that the country is at risk of squandering its position as a global financial leader. George Osborne He criticized the government’s inaction, especially with regards to stablecoins, which he sees as essential tools for reducing friction in global finance. Osborne stated that while the US is forging ahead with initiatives like the GENIUS Act to cement the dollar’s dominance in the stablecoin space, the UK risks irrelevance. He warned that the British pound — one of the world’s most traded currencies — may not even play a supporting role in the digital economy if current trends continue. Osborne’s critique was aimed in part at current Chancellor Rachel Reeves, whom he accused of failing to deliver on promises to support innovation in the digital currency sector. His comments were made after a controversial ad campaign by Coinbase titled “Everything Is Fine,” a satirical musical piece that mocks the UK’s economic stagnation and cost-of-living crisis. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the ad was banned by UK television networks. It suggests that the traditional financial system is broken and points to crypto as a modern alternative. While the ad’s ban could not be independently verified by CNBC, it has nevertheless led to some debate and drew attention to Coinbase’s growing lobbying efforts in the UK. Coinbase entered the UK market in 2015, and has been an aggressive force in shaping crypto regulation. This is particularly true in the US where it spent more on lobbying than any other crypto firm, according to Politico and OpenSecrets. Osborne’s op-ed and the company's latest campaign indicate that there is now a renewed push to influence policy in Britain. Critics Question GENIUS Act Motives While the US is making more progress with its GENIUS Act, it might not necessarily be in the right direction. The passage of the US GENIUS Act has been widely hailed as a major milestone for stablecoin adoption, but a controversial provision in the bill is drawing a lot of criticism for potentially limiting the appeal of digital dollars. The legislation bans stablecoin issuers from offering yield-bearing versions of their tokens. This move effectively prevents both retail and institutional holders from earning interest on digital dollar holdings. Critics argue that this plays into the hands of the traditional banking sector, which has long relied on controlling yield opportunities for depositors. Trump signs GENIUS Act (Source: Fox News ) Temujin Louie , CEO of crosschain protocol Wanchain, warned that the GENIUS Act may not be the unqualified win it seems to be. He pointed out that by prohibiting yield, the bill gives a competitive edge to tokenized money market funds, which are very quickly turning into Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins. JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho explained the potential of tokenized MMFs to serve as margin collateral and fulfill other use cases that were traditionally served by stablecoins. Louie agrees with this, and said that tokenization grants MMFs the speed and flexibility previously unique to stablecoins, while also preserving regulatory oversight. Paul Brody , global blockchain leader at EY, pointed out that tokenized MMFs and deposits could thrive in this new environment, since they can provide yield while functioning similarly to stablecoins. However, Brody added that stablecoins still maintain an edge in DeFi integration, thanks to their bearer asset nature, which allows easy use across decentralized platforms. If tokenized MMFs come with too many restrictions, their yield advantage might not be enough to win over users. The banking industry’s influence over the legislation has been a strong point of concern for many. Reports from earlier this year revealed that financial institutions were actively lobbying to block yield-bearing stablecoins, as they see them as a threat to their business model. NYU professor Austin Campbell shared that banks, having offered minimal interest for decades, fear losing ground if stablecoin issuers can provide yield directly to consumers. Despite the restrictions in the GENIUS Act, yield-bearing digital assets are not entirely absent from the US market. In February, the SEC approved the first yield-bearing stablecoin security, YLDS, issued by Figure Markets. It launched with a 3.85% yield. This means that there is a lot of potential for yield in tokenized assets, albeit under stricter securities regulations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,financial time osborne explained uk risk losing status financial leader u advance initiative like genius act osborne criticized chancellor rachel reef supported coinbase controversial ad campaign mocked uk economic stagnation pointed crypto alternative meanwhile genius act scrutiny u banning stablecoins critic say favor traditional bank undermines stablecoin innovation expert argue tokenized money market fund may benefit stablecoins still hold edge defi uk missing crypto opportunity george osborne former uk chancellor adviser coinbase issued stark warning united kingdom falling behind digital asset race particularly stablecoin sector recent financial time osborne voiced concern uk sluggish progress adopting policy argued country risk squandering position global financial leader george osborne criticized government inaction especially regard stablecoins see essential tool reducing friction global finance osborne stated u forging ahead initiative like genius act cement dollar dominance stablecoin space uk risk irrelevance warned british pound one world traded currency may even play supporting role digital economy current trend continue osborne critique aimed part current chancellor rachel reef accused failing deliver promise support innovation digital currency sector comment made controversial ad campaign coinbase titled everything fine satirical musical piece mock uk economic stagnation crisis according coinbase ceo brian armstrong ad banned uk television network suggests traditional financial system broken point crypto modern alternative ad ban could independently verified cnbc nevertheless led debate drew attention coinbase growing lobbying effort uk coinbase entered uk market aggressive force shaping crypto regulation particularly true u spent lobbying crypto firm according politico opensecrets osborne company latest campaign indicate renewed push influence policy britain critic question genius act motif u making progress genius act might necessarily right direction passage u genius act widely hailed major milestone stablecoin adoption controversial provision bill drawing lot criticism potentially limiting appeal digital dollar legislation ban stablecoin issuer offering version token move effectively prevents retail institutional holder earning interest digital dollar holding critic argue play hand traditional banking sector long relied controlling yield opportunity depositor trump sign genius act source fox news temujin louie ceo crosschain protocol wanchain warned genius act may unqualified win seems pointed prohibiting yield bill give competitive edge tokenized money market fund quickly turning wall street answer stablecoins jpmorgan strategist teresa ho explained potential tokenized mmfs serve margin collateral fulfill use case traditionally served stablecoins louie agrees said tokenization grant mmfs speed flexibility previously unique stablecoins also preserving regulatory oversight paul brody global blockchain leader ey pointed tokenized mmfs deposit could thrive new environment since provide yield functioning similarly stablecoins however brody added stablecoins still maintain edge defi integration thanks bearer asset nature allows easy use across decentralized platform tokenized mmfs come many restriction yield advantage might enough win user banking industry influence legislation strong point concern many report earlier year revealed financial institution actively lobbying block stablecoins see threat business model nyu professor austin campbell shared bank offered minimal interest decade fear losing ground stablecoin issuer provide yield directly consumer despite restriction genius act digital asset entirely absent u market february sec approved first stablecoin security ylds issued figure market launched yield mean lot potential yield tokenized asset albeit stricter security regulation,0.162,0.646,0.192,0.9657,1

2025-08-05 05:28:08,49563858,1754371688,Korean Analyst States: “This Level in Bitcoin is Like a Very Strong Magnet”,"Cryptocurrency analyst Min Tae-yoon has published a compelling analysis of the Bitcoin (BTC) price. According to Tae-yoon, BTC has reentered the classic “Triple Power” market structure, and as this structure nears its distribution phase, a break above $120,000 could trigger rapid upward momentum. Last weekend, Bitcoin's price fell to $112,000, a decline that some analysts believe could have triggered a “position reset” and paved the way for a rally. Tae-yoon argues that this correction could actually pave the way for a new upward move. The “Power of 3” model describes a three-stage market structure: “accumulation – manipulation – distribution.” This structure is particularly used to analyze the liquidity movements of institutional investors and is often preferred to understand the delayed reactions of individual investors. Related News: Donald Trump to Make Two Critical Appointments in the Next Few Days - Could Affect Markets, Here Are the Details According to the analysis, Bitcoin established a solid base in the $115,300-$119,500 range during the accumulation phase. The subsequent sudden drop dragged the price down to $112,000. This movement is generally interpreted as the liquidation of individual investors who bought at the peak and the creation of a new accumulation base in the market. One of the most striking points in Tae-yoon's analysis is that the $120,000 level acts as a “powerful price magnet.” If the price reaches and sustains above $115,300 and $116,800, Bitcoin could break through the $120,000 resistance and rapidly rally to the technical target of $126,000. It's estimated that $922 million worth of leveraged positions were liquidated during the recent correction. Position resets of this scale typically reduce market overheating and pave the way for a new rally. *This is not investment advice.

The company recently announced its groundbreaking Jetking Bitcoin strategy , becoming the first publicly traded Indian entity to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as its primary Bitcoin treasury reserve . This bold step marks a significant moment for Indian crypto adoption and could inspire many others. Jetking’s Ambitious BTC Accumulation Plan Takes Shape Jetking’s commitment to Bitcoin is not just symbolic; it is a meticulously planned financial pivot. As of May 2025, the company already holds 21 BTC. However, this is merely the beginning of their ambitious journey. Short-term Goal: Jetking plans to accumulate 210 BTC by the end of 2025. Long-term Vision: The ultimate target is an impressive 18,000 BTC by the year 2030. To fuel this aggressive BTC accumulation plan , Jetking successfully raised 17.6 crore rupees through two strategic equity rounds this year. This financial backing demonstrates serious intent behind their digital asset play. Why Embrace a Bitcoin Treasury Reserve? A Strategic Imperative You might wonder why an Indian IT education firm would venture so deeply into cryptocurrency. The answer lies in a proactive approach to economic uncertainties. Jetking aims to hedge against the persistent threats of inflation and the depreciation of fiat currency. This strategy mirrors that of U.S.-based MicroStrategy, a company renowned for its substantial corporate Bitcoin holdings . By holding Bitcoin, Jetking seeks to preserve and potentially grow its capital in a decentralized, inflation-resistant asset. It is a forward-thinking decision designed to safeguard the company’s future financial stability. Navigating India’s Complex Crypto Landscape Jetking’s pivot is particularly remarkable given India’s stringent cryptocurrency regulations. The nation has historically maintained a cautious stance on digital assets, with ongoing discussions about their legal framework. Despite these hurdles, Jetking has forged ahead, proving that strategic innovation can thrive even in challenging environments. The market has responded positively to this audacious move. Since announcing its crypto adoption, Jetking’s stock has surged by more than 135%. This significant increase indicates investor confidence in the company’s new direction and its potential for long-term growth, perhaps signaling a shift in perception towards Indian crypto adoption . What Does This Bold BTC Accumulation Plan Mean for India? Jetking’s pioneering Jetking Bitcoin strategy could set a precedent for other Indian corporations. Their success in navigating regulatory complexities and demonstrating the financial benefits of a Bitcoin treasury reserve might encourage more businesses to explore similar ventures. It highlights a growing trend of companies looking beyond traditional assets for value preservation and growth. The ambition to accumulate 18,000 BTC by 2030 positions Jetking not just as a participant, but as a potential leader in the global movement towards corporate Bitcoin holdings . This long-term vision emphasizes Bitcoin’s role as a robust store of value and a viable component of corporate balance sheets. In conclusion, Jetking Infotrain’s decision to embrace Bitcoin as a core treasury asset is a landmark event for India and the global crypto space. Their well-defined BTC accumulation plan , backed by significant equity raises and validated by soaring stock prices, demonstrates a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As Jetking continues its journey towards 18,000 BTC, the world will be watching to see how this audacious Indian crypto adoption story unfolds, potentially reshaping corporate finance in the region.

2025-08-05 05:24:52,49563719,1754371492,New Executive Order to Punish US Banks for Dropping Crypto Customers,"The White House order will involve banks being fined if they drop customers for political reasons or discriminate against digital asset firms and organizations. The executive order directs bank regulators to investigate whether any banks or financial institutions might have violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws, or consumer financial protection laws, reported The Wall Street Journal on Monday. The order threatens monetary penalties, consent decrees, and other disciplinary measures for violators and could be signed this week, the report added. Big Banks Can’t Discriminate Against Crypto “Cryptocurrency companies have said they were shut out of banking services under the Biden administration,” the report noted, though the order also includes being debanked on political grounds. White House preparing executive order that would punish banks that discriminate against crypto companies… via @dgtokar @ajsaeedy pic.twitter.com/XQrlUuWsC1 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 4, 2025 The banks claim their decisions are based on legal, regulatory, and financial risks, particularly anti-money laundering compliance, which has a wide scope, granting them a lot of control over people’s assets. “We’ve provided detailed proposals and will continue to work with the administration and Congress to improve the regulatory framework,” a Bank of America spokesman told the outlet. Banking regulators under Trump have already stopped assessing “reputational risk” from customers, which was seen as a boost for the crypto industry. The move represents a significant shift from Biden-era banking oversight under Operation Chokepoint 2.0, with the Trump administration positioning itself as the protector of crypto interests against alleged financial industry bias. There have been several cases in recent years where crypto industry experts or companies have been debanked, and the Trump administration clearly wants to put an end to this practice. JPMorgan Chase informed Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in December 2023 that they would close accounts of individuals whose primary income stemmed from crypto. Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, also said that JPMorgan told him they would close the accounts of anyone whose primary source of income or wealth was crypto. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, and the Bitcoin Foundation’s Charlie Shrem also said they were debanked. In November 2024, Elon Musk posted evidence that 30 tech founders were debanked under the Biden administration. Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked? https://t.co/gmnCir43XD — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 27, 2024 Banks Still Hate Crypto It is no surprise that banks harbor a lot of disdain against decentralized digital assets and companies that are part of the nascent industry. Banks profit from lending out their customers’ money and impose high levels of control and restrictions on what customers can and cannot do with their own money. Crypto is the complete antithesis of this, enabling peer-to-peer transfers and freedom over finances. Now that banks can see big profits in stablecoins, they appear to be warming to the industry (but for the wrong reasons). In related news, the United Kingdom recently banned a Coinbase advertising campaign that was critical of its financial system.

2025-08-05 05:22:06,49563973,1754371326,Banks face pressure from crypto and conservative groups,"The White House is gearing up to issue a sweeping executive order aimed at cracking down on banks accused of discriminating against conservative organizations and cryptocurrency businesses. A draft of the order, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, reveals that financial institutions could face stiff penalties for denying services based on political affiliations or ties to the crypto industry. The directive would require federal regulators to investigate potential violations of key laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust regulations, and consumer protection statutes. Banks in breach could be subject to fines, lawsuits, or compelled to enter legally binding agreements to reform their practices. While the order could be signed early this week, sources say the timeline remains fluid amid internal administration deliberations. If finalized, the move would signal a significant step by the Trump-aligned administration to safeguard banking access for groups it believes are being unjustly excluded—particularly conservatives and crypto-related entities. Banks face pressure from crypto and conservative groups For years, many conservative organizations and cryptocurrency-related companies have claimed that banks have closed their accounts or denied them financial services for political or ideological reasons. Some groups say they were flagged or dropped simply for holding conservative beliefs. Others in the crypto industry claim banks cut them off to avoid regulatory pressure, even if no laws were broken. One high-profile case, which is indirectly referenced in the draft order, involved Bank of America. The bank reportedly shut down accounts from a Christian group operating in Uganda. The organization accused the bank of targeting them for religious reasons. However, Bank of America responded that the decision was based on policy, not politics. The bank said it does not serve small businesses operating outside the U.S. as a matter of standard practice. The draft order also criticizes banks for their role in sharing customer data with law enforcement during the January 6 Capitol riot investigation. Some banks voluntarily flagged customer transactions or activity they believed were linked to the event. Supporters of the executive order say this sets a dangerous precedent where banks may act as political gatekeepers. Meanwhile, crypto companies have faced a long struggle to access banking services. Under the Biden administration , several firms have complained of being shut out from traditional banking due to what they call a “shadow ban” by regulators. Banks, on the other hand, argue that they are responding to legitimate compliance risks, especially when dealing with digital assets, which have been linked to fraud and money laundering. Many cite U.S. anti-money-laundering laws and a lack of clear guidance as reasons for caution. Banks act to avoid regulatory crackdown Over the past few months, several major financial institutions have updated their internal policies to clarify that they do not discriminate based on political belief or affiliation. Others have held meetings with Republican attorneys general to reassure them of their commitment to fairness. A spokesperson for Bank of America said the institution welcomes efforts by the administration to bring greater clarity to the rules. “We’ve provided detailed proposals and will continue to work with the administration and Congress to improve the regulatory framework,” he said. The draft executive order also includes new instructions for federal agencies. It calls on banking regulators to eliminate existing policies that may have encouraged banks to consider “reputational risk” when deciding whether to work with certain customers. Banks often use reputational risk to avoid business with politically sensitive or high-risk industries. This practice has been controversial. Critics argue it gives banks too much power to act as moral or political judges. Regulators under the Trump administration had previously said they would avoid using reputational risk as a standard. In addition, the draft order tells the Small Business Administration (SBA) to review how participating banks treat loan applicants—especially when those banks guarantee SBA-backed loans. This could affect thousands of small businesses that rely on federal support. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-08-05 05:20:00,49563972,1754371200,Remittix (RTX) and Ethereum (ETH) Set To Crush Cardano (ADA) In The 2025 Bull Market,"The recent cooldown in the broader market saw the Ethereum price drop to $3,390 before bulls managed to push the asset back near $3,570. The influx of investor capital into ETH’s ecosystem through Ethereum hasn’t slowed down, a sign that analysts view as a positive signal for market stability. Meanwhile, there is a Remittix (RTX) , an ETH-based utility token developed to cater to low-cost and direct cross-border settlements. This new crypto project has become a fan favorite among natives who look forward to its 100x growth potential. Analysts believe both projects will deliver investors more profits than Cardano this cycle. ADA followed a similar price trajectory to Ethereum in the last 48 hours, but what’s next for the asset this quarter? Let’s answer this question, but before that, we will discuss Ethereum price action and what you need to know about Remitix. Institutional Demand is Likely to Drive Ethereum Price Higher Major corporate entities are increasing their ETH holdings, fueling the chances of an imminent breakout. BitMine Immersion, for example, has raked in about $2.9 billion worth of Ethereum ( i.e., over 833,000 tokens ), making it the largest public Ethereum treasury holder as of today. Besides, Ethereum ETFs saw continuous inflows, including a 17-day streak of net inflows, with $65.14 million added in a single day, and BlackRock’s ETHA pushing $131.95 million in late July. It’s safe to say that despite the recent Ethereum price slip, institutional appetite is still on. Source: X Over the past 30 days, Ethereum price rallied over 44.5% to approximately $3,600, with analysts now targeting a breakout above $4,100, especially if there is continued institutional activity and ETF interest. Cardano (ADA): A Golden Cross, But Challenges Ahead Cardano followed a similar price trajectory to Ethereum price in the past week, bleeding for 5 successive days, before a 9.31% jump in the next 48 hours. As of today, Cardano buys and sells at $0.7521, with 24‑hour volume around $760 million, up 4.5% on the day but down 6.8% week to date. A few analysts are looking at a bearish outlook for ADA, with a Fear & Greed Index at 54 (Greed). Cardano recently formed its first-ever weekly golden cross, where the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week average; a bullish argument others are citing. However, ADA must reclaim levels above $0.8–$0.86 to maintain momentum; else, a slip below $0.69 could be next. Remittix Should Be Your Next Bet Remittix (RTX) is an Ethereum-layer token designed to tackle inefficient cross-border payments using low-cost on-chain rails. Built to serve global users from freelancers to SMEs and remitters, this payment network delivers instant, transparent crypto-to-fiat transfers without reliance on centralized exchanges. Remittix is well on track to be one of the best cryptos to buy this cycle. Here are other things you need to know: Remittix will support conversion within a range of 40+ crypto assets and 30+ fiat currencies at launch, making it usable from anywhere in the world. It allows real‑time FX conversion with fully transparent rates, meaning there are no hidden fees or surprise deductions. RTX will close on a 190T market gap.

2025-08-05 05:00:37,49563385,1754370037,Cold Wallet Rewards Every Transaction And Raises $5.6M As Presale Price Climbs Toward Explosive Launch ROI,"Some presales speak for themselves with the numbers. Cold Wallet’s CWT now sells for $0.00924, with an expected listing at $0.3517. That’s a potential 3,633% gain before any post‑launch growth. The concept behind Cold Wallet (CWT) is simple yet game‑changing, a wallet that rewards every transaction. With $5.6 million already raised and 15 stages gone almost instantly, demand shows no signs of slowing. It is not about proving if the model works; the real question is how much profit is left for those still watching. Every stage that sells pushes the buy‑in higher, trimming the returns for those who delay while the market quickly locks in positions. Cold Wallet Solves Crypto Most Expensive Fee Problem Crypto wallets have long felt like hidden fee collectors. Every transfer takes a cut , gas, swaps, bridges, even converting to fiat. Cold Wallet changes this with one bold idea: transactions should grow balances, not drain them. Powered by CWT, Cold Wallet turns daily usage into earnings. Cashback comes from sending, rebates from swapping, and rewards even for moving money in or out. With 15 presale stages already gone and over $5.6 million secured, CWT is gaining strong market attention. A major push came from acquiring Plus Wallet for $270 million, adding over two million active users before launch. This move sets Cold Wallet apart, driving adoption faster than expected and making it one of the most anticipated names in the current crypto scene. Whales Buy Fast Every Stage Reduces Future ROI Cold Wallet’s presale is attracting serious capital. Large buyers are securing millions of CWT early, speeding up sellouts beyond initial forecasts. Stage 15 was gone in hours, and Stage 16 is quickly running low. Since the start, the price has already climbed more than 34%. Each completed stage narrows the gap between the entry cost and the fixed listing price of $0.3517, cutting future returns for late entrants. Those entering at the current $0.00924 mark still face a projected 3,633% upside, yet the opportunity shrinks with every stage gone. Watching stages vanish in real time is a clear signal that hesitation comes at a high cost in this fast‑moving presale cycle. Price Forecast Suggests Bigger Story After Launch The crypto presale numbers alone are striking a 3,633% return at launch for Stage 16 entries if CWT reaches $0.3517. Yet, many analysts think this is just the start. Market discussions in private groups already speculate on post‑launch prices climbing toward $5 or even $10. At $0.00924, even a small rise toward these targets could turn a modest stake into life‑changing figures. The data is already visible for those who check the numbers, but the clock runs with every stage sold. The shrinking ROI with each increase in entry price is pushing early participation as the clear strategy before CWT hits public trading. One Thousand Dollar Stake Could Bring Thirty Seven Thousand Numbers tell the full picture. At $0.00924, a $1,000 stake secures over 108,000 CWT. If the coin meets its estimated launch value of $0.3517, that same stake becomes more than $37,000 before any post‑launch movement.If CWT reached $5, the stake would exceed half a million dollars. At $10, it would pass $1 million. While these are projections, not guarantees, they explain why early stages draw heavy demand. Every new stage raises the price and reduces future gains. Many are stepping in now to capture maximum upside, leaving hesitation as the main reason others may watch opportunity slip away before launch. Conclusion At $0.00924, CWT offers an expected 3,633% ROI by launch , already less than it was just days ago. Stage 15 sold out in a flash, Stage 16 is depleting fast, and the ROI continues to shrink with each allocation claimed. The market’s response is clear: $5.6 million already secured and growing because CWT is seen as one of the top opportunities right now. A $1,000 stake today could be $37,000 at launch. Miss this stage, and the price rises while gains fall. Such clear, near‑term potential is rare in crypto, and missing it is the kind of story that gets told for years.

The top altcoins to buy for the next bull run aren’t just hype plays; they come with real features, active platforms, and growing user bases. BlockDAG has pulled ahead with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, now offering BDAG at just $0.0016, with a 3,025% ROI possible if it hits the $0.05 launch price. At the same time, Bittensor (TAO) gains strength through institutional backing. Render (RENDER) is building GPU infrastructure on Solana, and NEAR Protocol is deepening DeFi through Cardano integrations. All four projects offer something unique: AI, graphics, cross-chain swaps, and a live trading simulator. But only one offers access at ground-floor pricing, BlockDAG . 1. BlockDAG: $361M Raised, GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Offer Ending Soon BlockDAG is making fast progress in 2025. It has raised $361 million and sold over 24.7 billion coins. While the standard Batch 29 price is $0.0276, a special offer under the GLOBAL LAUNCH release has unlocked a limited $0.0016 entry price. This deal is live until August 11. After that, the price returns to its actual batch rate. For those who get in now, the difference is big. The listing price is confirmed at $0.05, setting up a projected 3,025% ROI from the GLOBAL LAUNCH release price and 2,660% from Batch 1. BlockDAG isn’t just collecting funds. It’s delivering. Its Demo Trading Exchange is already live, letting users experience BDAG trading in real time. Both buying and demo selling functions are active. Every BDAG purchase also qualifies for the 10 BTC Auction Pool. This reward model is based on how much a user buys, not luck, making it more fair and direct. Outside trading, BlockDAG’s X1 miner app is already being used by more than 2.5 million people. Its architecture combines DAG technology with Proof-of-Work to allow fast, scalable processing without the usual blockchain delays. All of these points position BlockDAG (BDAG) as the best altcoin to buy for the next bull run. It’s already built, already live, and already rewarding users. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release ends August 11. After that, the low $0.0016 entry closes for good. That’s why BDAG continues to rise to the top of analyst lists, and why many see it as the most promising project to hold in 2025. 2. Bittensor (TAO): AI Growth and Institutional Entry Bittensor (TAO) has started attracting strong attention this quarter. A major wallet recently staked 41,500 TAO—worth about $15.4 million- across Subtensor’s validator layer. This makes up 4% of TAO’s circulating supply and is earning close to 10% APY. That kind of long-term staking shows clear confidence from institutional players. Validators are increasing across the network, especially in subnet clusters, which has improved uptime and decentralisation. At the same time, emissions are being absorbed quickly by delegation, so there’s no dump pressure visible on-chain. TAO is shaping up to be more than just an AI concept. It’s turning into a full utility network focused on building a decentralised AI compute layer. With more tools going live and big money entering, TAO is now among the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. 3. Render (RENDER): Solana GPU Power Gains Demand Render (RENDER) is moving fast. Built natively on Solana, it’s now being featured by exchanges like OKX and has grown its reach through GPU-based computing. With 517 million coins in circulation and a deflationary Burn-and-Mint system, RENDER keeps its supply controlled while supporting growing demand. The project is gaining real-world use with 3D graphics rendering, AI model training, and creative tools like OctaneRender. It’s even attracting interest from studios looking for cheaper, decentralised cloud alternatives. As GPU use increases across sectors, RENDER is catching attention beyond crypto circles. Its platform is functional, scalable, and already integrated with multiple industries. That utility, combined with its tight tokenomics, makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. 4. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): ADA Integration and Buy Pressure NEAR Protocol is showing clear signs of revival. Two key events pushed it back into analyst focus. First, NEAR launched a pilot with Cardano to allow trustless swaps of ADA using its Intents framework. This uses smart contracts like cardano.omft.near to carry out the swaps. Second, NEAR saw a sharp increase in trading activity, with volume up over 3% and price rising 3% in just one day. This followed increased interest from institutional buyers. The NEAR Intents platform has handled nearly $1 billion in total swap value and supports over 100 assets. This shows that NEAR’s settlement layer is catching on. With its unique AI sharding model and DeFi push, NEAR is regaining traction and looks like one of the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. Final Thoughts on the Top Crypto Picks for the Next Bull Run The altcoin market is quickly sorting winners from talkers. TAO’s AI infrastructure, RENDER’s GPU platform, and NEAR’s DeFi push each have strong futures. But BlockDAG brings something rare, real progress, live features, and 3,025% ROI upside through its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With $361 million raised, 24.7 billion coins sold, and a current $0.0016 price active only until August 11, BDAG offers unmatched value in this cycle. While others are scaling, BlockDAG is already operating. Its tools are live. Its rewards are flowing. That’s why it remains the top pick for those scanning the space for the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run.

2025-08-05 04:59:48,49563562,1754369988,"Summer’s top 3 high-potential tokens, only one still under $0.05","Built for practicality, powered by purpose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) won’t follow the noise—it will answer real market demands. The platform will operate on a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending structure that will allow users to contribute blue-chip assets like ADA, BNB, or SOL into smart contract-based pools to earn yield. On the borrowing side, users will be able to stake BTC and instantly unlock USDT or USDC at up to 75% loan-to-value. This model will give investors both stability and flexibility. For those looking to personalize their lending experience, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also provide a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) option. This feature will let individuals set customized terms—ideal for risk-managed trades or for leveraging high-risk tokens in the crypto ecosystem like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP, and BONK. The approach will blend passive income with customizable borrowing strategies, creating a truly user-centric lending marketplace. Additionally, Layer-2 blockchain integration will significantly reduce transaction costs, enhancing user efficiency without compromising decentralization. This technical advantage will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) far more accessible than legacy DeFi protocols still dependent on expensive Layer-1 gas models. Limited-time price, high-level traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale with tokens available at just $0.035. Out of the allocated 170 million tokens for this round, 10% are already taken up, with over $14 million raised to date. The low presale price offers entry below the $0.06 planned listing, giving buyers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a platform gearing up for strong momentum. The project’s credibility is supported by a thorough CertiK audit, including a 95 Token Scan score and a 78 Skynet score—both strong indicators of security and technical soundness. These scores reflect a well-audited smart contract framework and a roadmap that is already showing signs of serious execution. Adding to the community buzz is a $100,000 token giveaway —10 winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, giving thousands of participants a direct incentive to get involved. With over 14,900 holders and 12,000+ Twitter followers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction not just for its pricing, but also for its transparent operations and engaged community. Forecasts that turn heads, investments already paying off Experienced analysts are beginning to weigh in—and the expectations are substantial. One well-known market analyst, who made headlines in 2020 for correctly predicting XRP’s breakout, is now calling for a 20x rise in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as early as mid-2025. The reasoning is grounded in fundamentals: a decentralized stablecoin in development, real passive yield for lenders, and an integrated staking system that loops value back to long-term users. Already, some investors are reaping early benefits. One Phase 1 participant who swapped $3,000 in MATIC for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.01 is now holding tokens worth over $10,000—even before the official launch. With the token set to list at $0.06 and long-term targets approaching $1, these early positions are turning heads in investor circles. As whales start rotating out of large-cap positions in ETH, BTC, and AVAX in search of asymmetric upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly showing up on watchlists and wallets alike. The only undervalued contender left this summer Most of the summer’s top token picks have already taken off—many of them now out of reach for the average investor. But with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still priced under $0.05, it’s one of the last legitimate opportunities to enter a serious project at an early stage. With just 90% of Phase 6 tokens remaining and a scheduled 15% price jump to $0.040 in Phase 7, the current entry point won’t last much longer. Once listing happens, and especially as the Beta platform goes live, visibility and user demand are expected to climb significantly. Further exchange listings on major platforms like Binance, KuCoin, or Coinbase are likely to accelerate that growth, unlocking more exposure and bringing retail investors into the fold. Summer in crypto is usually filled with FOMO. For once, that fear might be justified. While others are buying tokens at peak valuations, investors who take action now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are positioning themselves at the front of the next breakout curve.

2025-08-05 04:57:06,49563561,1754369826,Best crypto to buy as ADA drops 2.4% as bearish momentum dominates?,"Consequently, investors are examining alternatives, seeking assets with stronger momentum and clearer growth paths amidst this crypto crash. This search makes identifying the best crypto to buy now crucial. Cardano faces technical and adoption hurdles Cardano confronts significant technical headwinds. Its price sits below key EMAs, including the 20, 50, and 100-period averages, signaling persistent weakness. The aspect of the three key interest areas is on the indicators. The DMI indicator exhibits that the -DI is well in the lead with 31.8 against a weak +DI line with 9.6, ascertaining the strength of the bearish trend indeed. Besides, the Bollinger Bands have expanded drastically to the lower side with the price of ADA below the lower band, thus an indicator of increased volatility on the selling side. Therefore, ADA’s near-term recovery depends heavily on holding the $0.68 support zone and overcoming the $0.78 resistance, a difficult task under current crypto prices. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates past $14 million Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates exceptional presale traction, directly contrasting Cardano’s struggles. Investors have contributed over $14,000,000 since the presale began. More than 665 million MUTM tokens have been sold to 14,800 holders. Phase 6 is currently underway, offering tokens at $0.035. This price represents a substantial 250% increase from the opening phase cost of $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, meaning the chance to acquire tokens at this discounted rate is ending soon. Consequently, the subsequent phase will see a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch officially at $0.06. Buying at the current Phase 6 price guarantees a minimum 71% return on investment at launch, making it a standout crypto investment opportunity. Robust security underpins Mutuum Finance project Security forms a critical pillar for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project team has successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit. This rigorous assessment yielded an outstanding 95.00 security score, reflecting a solid security posture. Complementing this, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is allocated, split across four tiers based on vulnerability severity: Critical vulnerabilities Major vulnerabilities Minor vulnerabilities Low severity issues This proactive approach incentivizes continuous scrutiny and enhances platform safety for all users. Also, the project introduced a new dashboard complete with a leaderboard that monitors the top 50 holders of the token. These top owners will obtain bonuses in token form to continue occupying these positions, which promotes long-term investment. Compelling value proposition and future potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility beyond speculative trading. Its core involves building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform operating efficiently on Layer-2 technology. The dual-lending model caters to diverse risk appetites, incorporating both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. P2C allows tokenizing major assets like BTC or ETH to earn interest, while P2P facilitates direct lending agreements, potentially offering higher yields. Tokenomics drive inherent value: the fixed 4 billion token supply faces increasing demand pressure as platform usage grows. Based on its fundamentals and market positioning, post-launch targets reaching $1.50 appear achievable, translating to massive gains for Phase 6 investors. This potential makes it a compelling candidate for the best crypto to buy now, especially compared to assets like ADA facing strong bearish headwinds. Actionable opportunity amidst market volatility While Cardano wrestles with bearish technicals and adoption speed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a demonstrably different trajectory. For investors seeking assets with strong momentum and fundamental utility during this period of crypto market uncertainty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a timely and strategic crypto investment.

2025-08-05 04:55:10,49562480,1754369710,Indian Rupee’s Alarming Plunge: Trump Tariff Threat Triggers Economic Fallout,"BitcoinWorld Indian Rupee’s Alarming Plunge: Trump Tariff Threat Triggers Economic Fallout In the dynamic world of finance, where digital assets often grab headlines, the foundational shifts in traditional currency markets continue to hold immense significance. The recent news of the Indian Rupee hitting a record low against the US Dollar, primarily triggered by the escalating Trump Tariff threat, serves as a stark reminder of how geopolitical tensions can send immediate ripples through global economies. For those accustomed to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, understanding the forces that sway fiat currencies like the Rupee provides crucial context for the broader financial ecosystem, highlighting the interconnectedness of all financial instruments, from decentralized digital currencies to established national tenders. What Triggered the Indian Rupee’s Alarming Decline? The Indian Rupee found itself in unprecedented territory, plumbing new depths against the mighty US Dollar. This alarming decline was not an isolated event but rather a direct consequence of mounting global trade tensions, specifically the renewed threats of tariffs from the United States under the then-Trump administration. When the US signaled its intent to impose tariffs on goods from various countries, including key trading partners, it sent a jolt through international markets. Investors, seeking safety amidst the uncertainty, began to pull capital from riskier, growth-oriented economies like India and park it in perceived safe-haven assets, predominantly the US Dollar. This sudden flight of capital created a surge in demand for the dollar, inevitably weakening currencies like the Rupee. The mechanism is straightforward: when foreign investors sell their Indian assets (stocks, bonds) to move their money elsewhere, they convert their Rupees into dollars, increasing the supply of Rupees and the demand for dollars. This imbalance directly contributes to the currency depreciation . Furthermore, the fear of a looming global trade war also dampened export prospects for India, reducing potential dollar inflows and exacerbating the Rupee’s woes. The sentiment of economic uncertainty alone can trigger significant market movements, as seen in the rapid devaluation of the Indian Rupee . Understanding the Trump Tariff Threat and its Global Ripple Effects The concept of the Trump Tariff threat emerged from an ‘America First’ economic policy, which sought to protect domestic industries through the imposition of import duties. Initially targeting steel and aluminum, these tariffs quickly expanded to include a wider range of goods, particularly from China, igniting fears of a full-blown Global Trade War . The rationale behind these tariffs was to reduce trade deficits and encourage domestic production, but their immediate effect was widespread market instability and retaliation from affected countries. The global ripple effects were immediate and far-reaching: Disruption of Supply Chains: Companies that rely on international sourcing faced increased costs, forcing them to either absorb losses, pass costs to consumers, or rethink their global manufacturing strategies. Investor Uncertainty: The unpredictable nature of tariff announcements created a climate of fear, leading investors to shy away from long-term commitments in volatile markets. Retaliatory Measures: Countries affected by US tariffs often responded with their own tariffs on American goods, escalating the trade conflict and harming exporters on both sides. Slowing Global Growth: Reduced international trade, coupled with diminished business confidence, threatened to put a brake on global economic expansion, impacting demand for goods and services worldwide. This protectionist stance, while intended to benefit one nation, inadvertently created significant headwinds for the global economy, directly influencing the stability of various currencies, including the Indian Rupee . Why Does Currency Depreciation Matter for India? For a net importing nation like India, significant currency depreciation carries substantial economic consequences. When the Indian Rupee weakens against the US Dollar, it means that India has to pay more Rupees for every dollar’s worth of imports. Given India’s heavy reliance on imported crude oil, electronics, and machinery, this translates directly into higher import bills. The immediate implications for India include: Inflationary Pressure: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to an increase in domestic prices for goods and services. This can erode purchasing power and impact household budgets. Increased Debt Burden: Many Indian companies and the government have borrowed in foreign currencies, particularly the US Dollar. A weaker Rupee makes it more expensive to service and repay these dollar-denominated debts, potentially straining corporate balance sheets and public finances. Impact on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): While a weaker Rupee might make Indian assets cheaper for foreign investors, the underlying economic instability caused by currency depreciation can deter new FDI, as investors prefer stable and predictable markets. Travel and Education Costs: For Indian citizens planning to travel abroad or send their children for overseas education, the cost in Rupees significantly increases, making international experiences less accessible. While a weaker currency can theoretically boost exports by making them cheaper for foreign buyers, the context of a Global Trade War often means that overall global demand might be shrinking, negating much of this potential benefit. Thus, the currency depreciation of the Indian Rupee presents a net challenge for the nation’s economic stability. The Broader Implications for Emerging Markets The challenges faced by the Indian Rupee are often symptomatic of broader vulnerabilities within Emerging Markets . These economies, characterized by rapid growth but often less developed financial systems and higher external debt, are particularly susceptible to global economic shocks and shifts in investor sentiment. When a major economy like the US initiates protectionist policies or raises interest rates, it can trigger a ‘contagion effect’ across the entire emerging market landscape. Key implications for Emerging Markets include: Challenge Explanation Capital Flight Investors pull funds from perceived riskier emerging market assets and move them to safer havens like US Treasury bonds, leading to currency depreciation and stock market declines. Increased Borrowing Costs As foreign capital exits, emerging market governments and companies find it more expensive to borrow, either domestically or internationally, stifling investment and growth. Imported Inflation Similar to India, reliance on imports means that weaker local currencies make essential goods, including energy and raw materials, more expensive, fueling inflation. Policy Dilemmas Central banks face a tough choice: raise interest rates to defend the currency (potentially hurting domestic growth) or allow the currency to depreciate further (risking inflation and debt issues). The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that a Trump Tariff threat, while aimed at specific trade imbalances, can create a ripple effect that destabilizes currencies and economies far beyond the direct targets, making the resilience of Emerging Markets a critical concern for global economic stability. Navigating the Global Trade War: Challenges and Potential Responses The specter of a Global Trade War presents complex challenges for policymakers worldwide, especially for countries like India that are deeply integrated into global supply chains. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies makes it difficult for businesses to plan and invest, potentially leading to reduced economic activity. Governments and central banks are left with a difficult balancing act, trying to mitigate the immediate impacts while also fostering long-term resilience. Potential responses and challenges include: Monetary Policy Tools: Central banks, like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), may consider interventions in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the Indian Rupee . However, such interventions can deplete foreign exchange reserves. Raising interest rates to attract capital is another option, but it risks slowing down domestic economic growth. Fiscal Measures: Governments might implement fiscal stimulus packages or provide support to industries most affected by tariffs to cushion the blow. However, this could strain public finances. Diversification of Trade Partners: Countries might actively seek to diversify their trade relationships, reducing reliance on specific markets that are prone to protectionist policies. This involves exploring new export markets and sourcing alternatives for critical imports. Strengthening Domestic Demand: Focusing on boosting internal consumption and investment can help offset the negative impacts of reduced international trade. Advocacy for Multilateralism: Engaging in international forums and advocating for open, rules-based trade systems remains crucial to counter protectionist tendencies and prevent a full-blown Global Trade War . The long-term economic outlook for countries caught in the crossfire depends heavily on their ability to adapt to changing global trade dynamics and implement sound economic policies that foster stability and growth despite external pressures. The experience of the Indian Rupee during this period underscores the critical need for robust economic frameworks in an increasingly unpredictable global landscape. The episode of the Indian Rupee hitting a record low due to the Trump Tariff threat serves as a powerful case study in the intricate dance between geopolitics, trade, and currency markets. It underscores how decisions made in one part of the world can have immediate and profound consequences across the globe, particularly for vulnerable Emerging Markets . The resulting currency depreciation highlights the challenges faced by nations striving for economic stability amidst the storm of a potential Global Trade War . As the world continues to navigate complex international relations, understanding these dynamics becomes paramount for investors, policymakers, and everyday citizens alike. The resilience of national economies will be tested, demanding agile responses and strategic foresight to weather future economic uncertainties.

In 2025, the meme coin sector is on fire, evolving from pure entertainment to financial ecosystems with actual value and mechanisms. Arctic Pablo Coin leads the revolution alongside rising sensations like Peanut the Squirrel, Neiro, Dogwifhat, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Pudgy Penguins. But while all these tokens tap into the meme magic, Arctic Pablo shines among the top 10 meme coins with features that bring more than laughs. Arctic Pablo Coin introduces staking utility, community-centered design, and tokenomics that reward savvy investors. The meme world is no longer just about viral tweets — it’s about utility, engagement, and innovation. This list unveils the most promising meme coins heading into the next crypto boom — with Arctic Pablo Coin leading the charge. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin: Stake to Earn With Utility Power Arctic Pablo Coin is everything most meme coins are not: structured, rewarding, and utility-driven. One of its standout features is its staking ecosystem, where holders can earn a generous 66% APY simply by locking up their tokens. This is a massive shift in the meme coin meta — no longer are holders dependent solely on price spikes. Arctic Pablo Coin allows for sustainable, long-term gains through a built-in rewards mechanism. Why are serious investors taking notice? Because Arctic Pablo Coin fuses meme culture with DeFi principles, offering both personality and profitability. This isn’t just about following a trend; it’s about building wealth within a fun and engaging brand. Community contests, gamified events, and evolving features make Arctic Pablo Coin an ecosystem, not just a token. Arctic Pablo shines among the top 10 meme coins by offering actual use cases and tangible returns in a space often dominated by hype alone. $1,250 Today Could Become $14,080—Arctic Pablo’s Presale Delivers Unmatched Gains Arctic Pablo Coin’s explosive meme coin presale is deep into its 35th stage—Firefrost Flats, with tokens priced at just $0.00071. Over $3.22 million has already poured in, and savvy investors are making bold moves before this opportunity melts away. At the current rate, a $1,250 investment grabs you 1,760,000 APC tokens—and with the confirmed launch price of $0.008, that stack could explode to $14,080, netting a massive 1026.76% return. But that’s just scratching the surface. If APC hits analysts’ bold target of $0.1, your $1,250 could balloon into $176,000, showcasing an eye-watering 13,984.50% ROI potential. Those who got in before Stage 35 are already reaping 4,633.33% returns, proving this is not hype—it’s history in the making. Arctic Pablo is flashing bright on every radar. Will you act before Stage 36 kicks in? 2. Peanut the Squirrel: Whimsical Energy Meets Smart Growth Peanut the Squirrel bursts onto the scene with undeniable charm and strong community backing.

But from that mayhem rose a community-driven beast, now involved in staking, liquidity mining, and NFT-based rewards. Bonk has evolved from a joke into a meme coin with movement. Is Bonk more than a quick pump? Yes. Its developers continuously add features that align with Solana’s speed and scalability, ensuring Bonk’s ecosystem keeps expanding.

2025-08-05 04:40:10,49561884,1754368810,Remitly Stablecoins: Revolutionizing Global Payments with Unprecedented Speed,"BitcoinWorld Remitly Stablecoins: Revolutionizing Global Payments with Unprecedented Speed Get ready for a significant shift in how we send money across borders! Remitly, a leading U.S.-based digital remittance service, is gearing up to introduce Remitly stablecoins into its operations. This move is poised to transform the international money transfer landscape, promising faster and more cost-effective solutions for customers in over 170 countries. The integration of stablecoins, backed by innovative blockchain technology, signals a new era for cross-border payments . What Are Stablecoins and Why Are They Game-Changing for Digital Remittances? You might be wondering, what exactly are stablecoins? Simply put, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a traditional fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, their value remains consistent, making them ideal for transactions. Stability: Their fixed value eliminates the price fluctuations common with other cryptocurrencies. Efficiency: Transactions can be processed much faster than traditional banking methods. Cost-Effectiveness: Lower fees are often associated with stablecoin transfers, especially for international transactions. Remitly’s embrace of stablecoins is a strategic step to enhance its existing digital remittances services, leveraging the inherent advantages of blockchain for improved user experience. How Will Remitly Stablecoins Enhance Cross-Border Payments? The introduction of Remitly stablecoins is expected to bring several tangible benefits to users sending money internationally. Traditional remittance services often involve multiple intermediaries, leading to delays and higher costs. Blockchain-powered stablecoins can streamline this process significantly. Consider these key improvements: Reduced Transaction Times: Money could arrive at its destination in minutes, not days. This is a crucial advantage for families relying on timely support. Lower Fees: By cutting out some intermediaries, Remitly can potentially offer more competitive exchange rates and lower transaction fees. This means more money reaches the recipient. Increased Transparency: Blockchain transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering a clear and auditable trail for every transfer. Broader Accessibility: For users in regions with limited access to traditional banking, digital remittance solutions powered by stablecoins can provide a vital financial bridge. This initiative underscores a growing trend of stablecoin adoption within the mainstream financial sector. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Blockchain Payments? While the prospect of blockchain payments through stablecoins is exciting, the journey also presents its share of challenges. Regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are still evolving globally. Remitly will need to navigate diverse legal landscapes to ensure seamless and compliant operations in all 170+ countries it serves. However, the opportunities are immense. As more fintech companies explore blockchain solutions, the potential for a truly interconnected and efficient global financial system grows. Remitly’s move could inspire other remittance providers to explore similar innovations, fostering a more competitive and user-friendly market for international money transfers. This forward-thinking approach positions Remitly at the forefront of financial innovation. In conclusion, Remitly’s planned introduction of stablecoins for cross-border payments marks a pivotal moment for the digital remittance industry. By harnessing the power of blockchain, the company aims to deliver faster, more affordable, and transparent services to its global customer base. This development not only promises a better experience for users but also signals a broader embrace of stablecoin technology in mainstream finance, truly revolutionizing how we send and receive money across the world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Remitly’s primary goal with stablecoin integration? A1: Remitly aims to provide faster, more cost-effective, and efficient international money transfer services by leveraging the stability and speed of stablecoins. Q2: How do stablecoins differ from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? A2: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency, making them suitable for everyday transactions and remittances. Q3: Will this change affect the cost of sending money with Remitly? A3: The integration of stablecoins is expected to potentially lower transaction fees and offer more competitive exchange rates due to increased efficiency. Q4: What role does blockchain technology play in this initiative? A4: Blockchain technology underpins stablecoins, providing the secure, transparent, and decentralized infrastructure necessary for faster and more efficient cross-border transactions. Q5: Which countries will benefit from this stablecoin integration? A5: Remitly serves customers across more than 170 countries, and the stablecoin integration aims to benefit users in all these regions by enhancing service quality.

2025-08-05 04:39:05,49561761,1754368745,Important Security Update for All Pi Network Users: Details Inside,"TL;DR A popular news channel dedicated to covering Pi Network developments posted today about a security update implemented by the Core Team. Separately, Pi Network’s official account reminded its users how they can benefit by locking up their tokens. Passkey Added The verification process at all Pi Network systems has been a highly controversial topic within its community, as countless users have complained in the past that they were unable to receive the necessary green light, despite the team’s continuous efforts. Pi News’ screenshot of the latest update shows the addition of Passkey in the Pi Wallet, which is positioned just below the information about whether the account has been verified through an ID and the password for entering the account. Passkey is an interesting alternative as it works in the following way: it’s a passwordless login method, which aims to replace traditional passwords with a more secure and convenient alternative. Users can employ biometrics (fingerprint or facial recognition) or a device PIN, instead of typing in a password.

Have you got this feature yet? #PiNetwork pic.twitter.com/tWBMwVvX0i — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) August 5, 2025 Lockup Reminder In a separate post published a few days ago, the Core Team reminded its community that they can benefit from locking up their Pi tokens to boost mining rates. “Remember: Pioneers can voluntarily choose to create Lockups regardless of their migration status. Pre-migration Lockup configurations boost Pioneers’ current Pi based on future Lockup settings and affects Pi in the next migration. Post-migration Lockups apply to the Pi that Pioneers have acquired on the Mainnet blockchain and is free to be locked up.” These lockups are completed through the Pi Wallet app, and the mining boost will go into effect in the subsequent mining session. The process aims to support a “robust and stable ecosystem and incentivize long-term engagement with the network.” It’s worth noting that there are a few differences between the pre-migration and post-migration lockups. While they follow the same reward logic, they differ in timing and the Pi tokens they affect. Pre-migration applies to future balances during migration, while the post-migration goes directly on-chain to already migrated tokens. Additionally, post-migration lockups introduce a 200% option, enabling users to boost mining rewards using extra Pi earned beyond mining.

Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6, with the token priced at $0.035. The next price rise is set at 14.29% higher, which will take the token to $0.04. Presale buyers who invest during this phase will experience a return on investment of 71.43% upon launch of the token at $0.06. MUTM presale has raised more than $14 million and gained more than 14,800 unique holders. While ADA’s price momentum remains under the microscope amid fluctuating macroeconomic signals and shifting investor sentiment, the rising interest in Mutuum Finance is quietly gaining traction. Cardano (ADA) Pushes Toward $1 As Resistance Nears $0.85 Cardano is currently trading around $0.76, having climbed from July lows in the $0.60–$0.65 range and holding firm above key support near $0.80 after a breakout from a multi-week consolidation pattern. Technical signals are showing strength: rising open interest, a bullish pennant breakout, and key EMAs turning higher, fueling analyst expectations of a rally toward $1.00–$1.20, with some forecasts even projecting $2.00–$3.00 later in 2025 if momentum continues and ecosystem adoption accelerates. Still, failure to clear resistance around $0.85–$0.90 could see ADA remain range-bound or retrace toward $0.70–$0.75 in the near term. In this market, traders are also monitoring evolving DeFi themes and emerging utility protocols like Mutuum Finance. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance just ended its Phase 5 presale and moved into Phase 6, with its tokens selling at $0.035. The next price adjustment will see another 14.29% increase to take the token price to $0.04. Early investors will enjoy a 71.43% ROI when the token falls at $0.06. The presale of MUTM already raised more than $14 million and acquired more than 14,800 individual holders. Mutuum Finance Partners with CertiK to Launch $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a Bug Bounty Program. The program reward pool is $50,000 USDT. Four severities i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded. The move showcases the objective of Mutuum Finance to create community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been extensively audited by Certik for user fund security and blockchain security. The triumph is a success of Mutuum Finance’s vision of being an open and institutional-grade DeFi protocol. Massive MUTM Token Giveaway Unveiled by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein the users will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Its recently launched leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders. Cardano (ADA) may aim for $3, but it’s still trading under $0.80 with heavy resistance ahead. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining fast at just $0.035. It’s now in Presale Phase 6 with a 14.29% price jump coming soon. At launch, the token will list at $0.06, giving investors a 71.43% ROI. Over $14 million has already been raised. More than 14,800 investors are in.

2025-08-04 18:26:45,49536775,1754332005,UK Bans Coinbase’s ‘Everything Is Fine’ Ad: CEO Says It Exposes Flaws in Finance,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has responded to the backlash surrounding the company’s latest advertisement for the UK market. He clarified that the video was not intended as a political statement, but rather as a reflection of the deeper issues within the traditional financial system. The Controversial Campaign The U.S.-based exchange recently posted an advertisement on July 31 via X, criticizing the UK’s financial system. Titled ‘Everything Is Fine’, the video features a cheerful song and lyrics that brag about the UK’s strong finances, while showing harsh scenes of inflation, poverty, debt, and people struggling to get by. Meant as a satirical depiction of the state of things, it starts with the line, “We ain’t got no troubles. No reason to complain,” while broken homes and poor people appear on the screen. The song continues, “The streets can’t get no cleaner. Nor the rat meat any leaner. No. Life is just as great,” as dirty streets flash across the screen. The video also makes fun of how expensive things have become in the UK. However, on August 4, Armstrong took to X, claiming the ad had been “banned in the UK by the TV networks,” suggesting it had been censored because it carried an element of truth. “If you can’t say it, then there must be a kernel of truth in it.” Some individuals and politicians have criticized the campaign, arguing that it is a political statement intended to discredit the current government and make Britain a laughingstock. However, the executive explained that calling for updates to the system and societal improvements wasn’t meant to be a political statement about any party in the UK. He also clarified that the clip wasn’t specific to the country, mentioning that the firm had also run ads with similar themes in the U.S.. Crypto As a Fix For Broken Systems According to Armstrong, the point of the clip was to highlight how the traditional financial system is failing many people and how crypto offers a way to address the issue. He added that some people in the UK still view the asset class as “some kind of gambling product,” which he described as a very outdated perspective that ignores its real potential to improve conditions for everyone. The executive concluded by welcoming criticism and censorship efforts, saying they only help the message spread further. The controversial campaign comes at a time when 20.3 million people in the UK, which is 44% of all adults, are living in financially unstable conditions. According to a recent report by Fair4All Finance, this represents a 16% increase since 2022, driven by factors such as unstable incomes, limited savings, poor health, and job loss. Meanwhile, experts say the UK is falling behind in creating clear rules for crypto. A July report from independent think tank OMFIF says that the country continues to make vague promises about future rules in what it described as “policy procrastination,” warning that the EU and U.S. are now leading the way.

2025-08-04 18:26:08,49536819,1754331968,"Donald Trump to Make Two Critical Appointments in the Next Few Days – Could Affect Markets, Here Are the Details","US President Donald Trump is planning to make new appointments to two key institutions in the coming days. This includes filling the vacant position at the Federal Reserve and appointing new directors to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The openings in question occurred on Friday. The first Fed post was opened by the surprise resignation of Board Member Adriana Kugler, while the second position was left vacant after Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he was considering several candidates for the Fed and would soon appoint a replacement for McEntarfer. “I have a few names in mind, and I'll probably announce them in the next few days,” he said. Kugler's term was set to end in January, but he decided to leave early, effective August 8. He did not provide a reason in his letter to Trump. Kugler, who served on the Fed's board, was also a permanent member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates in the U.S. economy. Board members also have a say in banking regulations. Kugler, whose term lasted less than two years, largely aligned with Chairman Jerome Powell's policies. Powell, however, has been a frequent critic of Trump. Trump has previously stated that future Fed nominees will be considered for their propensity to vote for interest rate cuts. Related News: Analysis Company CEO Predicts Potential Altcoin Season - “Transition from Bitcoin to Altcoins...” Krishna Guha, a global policy strategist at Evercore ISI, said Kugler's resignation “accelerates Trump's drive to bring the Fed into line.” Guha believes Trump could use the vacancy to appoint a potential replacement for Powell. Possible candidates include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. McEntarfer's dismissal, meanwhile, comes on the heels of Friday's weak nonfarm payrolls data. According to the BLS, only 73,000 new jobs were added to the US economy in July, while the figures for the previous two months were revised downward by a combined 258,000. Trump criticized McEntarfer in a post on Truth Social on Sunday, holding him responsible for “the biggest calculation errors of the last 50 years.” While revisions to monthly employment data are commonplace, such corrections have become more frequent in recent years as the BLS has experienced a decline in survey responses. Indeed, the agency downgraded its total employment data by 818,000 jobs for the 12 months through March 2024. Speaking to CNBC, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said, “Transparency and reliability in labor force data are crucial. The market positions itself based on this data. Therefore, a fresh perspective is needed.” However, McEntarfer's dismissal sparked backlash due to concerns that an institution like the BLS, which is expected to be technical and impartial, could become politicized. “The politicization of the Fed has been much discussed in recent months, but the politicization of the data collection process is just as dangerous,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Economist Michael Feroli commented. *This is not investment advice.

Silbert, who owns Grayscale, resigned in December 2023 after the company was hit with a lawsuit from the New York Attorney General’s office which accused Silbert and DCG of misleading investors and hiding financial losses totaling more than $1 billion. Both Silbert and DCG denied the claims, and the case is ongoing in New York state court. Silbert was replaced by DCG's chief financial officer Mark Shifke, who will remain a board member. Grayscale filed a confidential submission for an initial public offering last month, despite the ongoing legal back-and-forth with the New York Attorney General's office. ""I'm honored to rejoin the Grayscale board at a defining moment for both the company and the broader digital asset ecosystem,"" Silbert said in a statement. ""I continue to have deep conviction in the company’s long-term positioning and in the leadership team guiding it forward."" Grayscale also hired a new chief operating officer, chief marketing officer, chief communications officer, and as chief human resources officer, who all report to Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg.

2025-08-04 18:22:14,49536688,1754331734,Capital B Raises $13.3M Through Convertible Bonds to Expand Bitcoin Treasury Strategy,"French Bitcoin treasury company Capital B raised €11.5 million ($13.3 million) through a combination of equity and convertible bonds from TOBAM Bitcoin Alpha Fund to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. The transaction includes a €5 million capital increase at €2.90 per share and €6.5 million in convertible bonds through its Luxembourg subsidiary, The Blockchain Group Luxembourg SA. TOBAM Partnership Fuels 2,275% Strategy Returns Capital B announces a capital increase and a convertible bonds issuance for an amount of ~€11.5 million with TOBAM BITCOIN ALPHA FUND to pursue its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/w9CKirG4j8 Full Press Release (FR):… pic.twitter.com/kdIlME04xd — Capital B (@_ALCPB) August 4, 2025 The funding could allow Capital B to acquire approximately 160 additional Bitcoin, bringing the potential total holdings to 2,173 BTC as Europe’s first listed Bitcoin treasury company. The convertible bonds carry a five-year maturity with conversion prices ranging from €3.66 to €4.75 per share, with 95% of proceeds designated for Bitcoin acquisition. Capital B’s ALTBG strategy component delivered exceptional returns of 2,275% from November 2024 to July 2025, vastly outperforming Bitcoin’s 58% gain during the same period. The company’s sats per share metric increased from 15 in November 2024 to 1,933 by July 2025, following multiple capital raises and strategic partnerships. The deal coincides with accelerating corporate Bitcoin adoption globally, as MicroStrategy acquired 21,021 BTC for $2.46 billion at $117,256 per coin, bringing total holdings to 628,791 BTC. Strategy has acquired 21,021 BTC for ~$2.46 billion at ~$117,256 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.0% YTD 2025.

The first tranche of €6.5 million converts at €3.6557 per share, representing 130% of the July 31 volume-weighted average price. A second optional tranche worth €13 million can be exercised within three months at higher conversion prices designed to ensure a positive BTC yield. The conversion rate equals either a 30% premium to the first tranche price or a floor price to maintain Bitcoin accumulation per diluted share. TOBAM gained considerable influence through the transaction, with potential ownership reaching 4.47% on a fully diluted basis. The partnership builds on previous collaborations, including OCA B-02 and OCA A-03 agreements that contributed to Capital B’s growth trajectory. The Luxembourg subsidiary structure allows European regulatory compliance while maintaining focus on Bitcoin treasury operations. Zero-coupon bonds provide cost-effective financing compared to traditional debt instruments while preserving equity upside through conversion features. Source: Capital B Capital B’s strategy targets Bitcoin-per-share growth over dividends or traditional returns. The company tracks sats per share as a key performance indicator, measuring Bitcoin accumulation relative to share dilution from capital raises. Corporate Bitcoin Wave Accelerates Amid Market Volatility MicroStrategy launched a $4.2 billion at-the-market equity program for STRC preferred shares following record quarterly performance. Net income surged to $2.3 billion, driven by unrealized Bitcoin gains as BTC soared above $110,000 during Q2 2025. The company also raised $10.5 billion in gross proceeds over four months through multiple share classes and ATM facilities. Additionally, Bitcoin holdings valued at approximately $69.4 billion generate substantial balance-sheet appreciation during crypto market rallies. Similarly, Metaplanet filed for $3.6 billion in preferred stock funding while adding 463 Bitcoin to reach 17,595 total coins worth $1.78 billion. The Japanese firm achieved 430.2% year-to-date BTC yield through aggressive accumulation funded by equity issuances and bond redemptions. European adoption expanded with Smarter Web Company surpassing 2,000 Bitcoin holdings after purchasing 225 BTC for £19.9 million . The London-listed firm achieved 49,198% year-to-date BTC yield under its “10 Year Plan” treasury strategy.

2025-08-04 18:09:19,49536169,1754330959,CrediX Loses $4.5M in Hack Due to Compromised Admin Account,"CrediX, a decentralized exchange that lets people trade synthetic digital dollars, USDC, without a middleman, has just suffered a serious hack. Attackers were able to steal around $4.5 million after gaining access to a compromised administrator account. As revealed , the account had access to some of the most powerful controls within the system. The event has triggered panic among investors and users. The protocol’s development team has yet to provide clear answers or a recovery plan. Hacker Fakes Tokens and Drains Millions from CrediX The exploit started when an attacker took over an admin account on CrediX. This account had very wide permissions across the platform. It could control pools, move assets, handle emergencies, and change risk settings. With this level of access, the attacker could carry out operations that usually need several approvals. The hacker was able to create a large amount of fake USDC tokens. For context, acUSDC is a made-up version of USDC that only works inside CrediX and it is not backed by real assets. The attacker then used the fake tokens to borrow real funds from the platform’s pools. After that, they moved the real assets out and stole funds that users had entrusted to the platform. This event has added to the growing list of 2025 DeFi security breaches. Website Goes Down, Investors Left Confused After the attack, CrediX quickly took down its website. The team advised users to bypass the standard site and use smart contracts directly to access their funds. This shows how serious the hack really was. The platform did not have backup systems in place to remove or limit the stolen permissions, so the developers were forced to take the entire interface offline. This situation has caused fear and confusion among users, many of whom are unsure about the safety of their assets. So far, the developers have not released any full explanation, audit report, or timeline for fixing the problem. As a result, investors are left with little information and growing doubts. Collapse of Trust in the Protocol The damage caused by this breach goes beyond the stolen funds. Trust in the entire CrediX protocol has been deeply affected. The acUSDC token, which played an important role in the platform, has lost its credibility since it was used to drain the pools without proper backing. Other tokens linked to CrediX, including those used for governance or utility, are also likely to lose value. Developers and users now question the safety of CrediX’s smart contracts. Experts said that the fact that one account was able to act with such power across different areas of the system shows a major design flaw. In decentralized finance , there is always risk, but this kind of setup creates a single point of failure that can bring down the entire platform if compromised.

2025-08-04 18:07:31,49537179,1754330851,SHIB and PEPE holders are betting on this token as the next 100x meme coin,"Call it intuition. Call it experience. Call it market wisdom. Early Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin holders know precisely what it feels like to watch a joke coin explode into a billion-dollar asset. And now, these same early birds are swarming into something new. A meme token. Dirt cheap. Community-rich. Infrastructure-loaded. It’s called Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , and it’s not just catching attention. It’s a stealing conviction. Investors who once rode SHIB and PEPE to generational wealth believe this under-$0.003 meme coin is on track to the top 10 crypto rank. From laughs to Lambos: what SHIB and PEPE veterans are seeing in $LILPEPE Ask any Shiba or Pepe early adopter what made them invest. They’ll tell you it wasn’t just the memes. It was the feeling. That rare, electric buzz around a project is still flying under the radar, but it is building all the right pieces. Little Pepe is delivering that same spark. But with one major upgrade: incorporating real tech into the momentum. Little Pepe is delivering real value under the hood. It introduces its personal Layer-2 ecosystem, a fast, scalable foundation that powers the entire project. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on sentiment, Little Pepe offers actual DeFi potential. This sets LILPEPE up for a legacy-building movement. This ain’t just another meme coin. it’s a meme engine! Think of what made Pepe explode: meme energy, lightning-fast virality, and non-stop community fuel. Imagine giving that same firepower a Launchpad, an ecosystem layer where other tokens can be born, presales can happen, and DEX launches can thrive. That’s what Little Pepe is doing with the Pepe Launchpad. This tax-free, sniper bot-resistant platform gives early-stage projects and investors a real fighting chance. It’s like launching Dogecoin… but with a real use case and DeFi backbone. With a recent smart contract audit completed, a live listing on CoinMarketCap, and a highly anticipated CEX debut scheduled for after the presale, LILPEPE is building trust around its technology and momentum. A presale story that feels like 2021 again When SHIB was trading in fractions of a cent, few people believed it could do what it did. The same was true of PEPE. But in hindsight, it’s always obvious: community + early entry + strong narrative = moon. Little Pepe has all three. The presale has entered Stage 9, with over 9.75 billion tokens sold. The token is up 80% from Stage 1, rising from $0.001 to $0.0018. The final launch price is $0.003, which means buyers today are still early. And if that wasn’t enough? The team runs a $777,000 giveaway, with ten winners receiving $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. That kind of bold, attention-grabbing move can quickly build a viral army. Will it 100x? or just crack the top 10? Let’s be real: the market doesn’t owe anyone another 100x. But when thousands of meme veterans who made life-changing gains from SHIB and PEPE start calling something the next big thing, it’s wise to pay attention. Little Pepe is not some recycled meme with a new face. It’s a complete ecosystem, still a micro-cap. However, that micro-cap status may not last long with post-launch exchange support, growing daily volume, and a roadmap that includes major ecosystem upgrades. Top 10? It’s too early to say. But 100x from here? Very possible. Very believable. And judging by the wallets loading daily, a growing army of meme coin legends already agrees. If you missed SHIB or PEPE, this is your do-over Most people didn’t buy SHIB at launch. Most ignored PEPE until it was too late. But LILPEPE is still ridiculously early. The holders who made millions on previous meme cycles aren’t just watching anymore. They’re buying. Since $LILPEPE is already becoming the next meme movement, those who know what to look for are already invested. The next SHIB? The next PEPE? No, this is the first Little Pepe.

2025-08-04 18:05:58,49535997,1754330758,Pundit: XRP is the Liquidity in a Tokenized World,"In a thought-provoking post on X, financial commentator John Squire declared , “In a tokenized world, $XRP is the liquidity layer.” His statement reflects a broader shift in how XRP is perceived, not merely as a speculative digital asset, but as a foundational element in the emerging architecture of tokenized finance. XRP as the Liquidity Engine of Tokenized Markets Tokenization , the process of converting real-world assets (RWAs) like bonds, currencies, and equities into blockchain-based tokens, is rapidly transforming global finance. As this trend accelerates, the need for a universal liquidity bridge becomes paramount. According to Squire, XRP is uniquely positioned to serve that role. Through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, XRP already enables cross-border payments without the need for pre-funded accounts. This functionality has made XRP instrumental in remittance corridors and low-friction settlement across fiat currencies. But the scope is now expanding. Ripple’s partnerships with institutions, including the $280 million digital commercial paper tokenized on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), mark XRP’s growing role in institutional capital markets. Challenging Market Cap Misconceptions Squire has consistently challenged what he calls “Excel logic”—the belief that XRP cannot reach higher valuations due to its market cap. He points to historical market behavior where small inflows led to significant price increases, highlighting how limited circulating supply and deep-pocketed holders create conditions for steep, liquidity-driven moves. With over 95% of XRP held long-term or locked in escrow, a relatively small increase in demand can create disproportionate upward pressure on price. This idea is not merely theoretical. Market cycles have shown how XRP can surge during periods of heightened demand, and Squire argues this dynamic will intensify as tokenized asset adoption grows. Real-World Tokenization Use Cases Squire emphasizes XRP’s real-world utility as tokenization gains traction . Forecasts suggest over $19 trillion in assets will be tokenized by 2033, and Ripple is already building infrastructure to support that future. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projects such as real estate tokenization, tokenized treasuries, and debt instruments on XRPL reflect this evolution. Corporate adoption is growing, too—Webus recently announced a $100 million initiative to incorporate XRP into its treasury reserves. This expanding utility aligns with Ripple’s vision of the XRP Ledger as a platform for compliant, interoperable tokenized finance, bridging different asset classes and currencies seamlessly. Institutional Barriers and Compliance Workarounds Despite XRP’s capabilities, regulatory hurdles remain. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz , recently noted that Ripple cannot use the XRPL’s native decentralized exchange (DEX) due to compliance concerns. However, he supports the development of “permissioned domains”—private, regulatory-compliant zones within XRPL that would allow institutions to tap into its liquidity without breaching legal boundaries. Squire spotlighted this as a key solution to bridge institutional demand with decentralized infrastructure. John Squire’s assertion—that “XRP is the liquidity layer” in a tokenized world—is supported by a growing body of real-world evidence. XRP is no longer just a payment token; it is becoming the underlying engine that facilitates liquidity across tokenized economies. From enabling seamless global payments to powering institutional-grade tokenization, XRP is emerging as the bridge asset for tomorrow’s financial system . As tokenization continues to redefine how value moves, Squire’s insight may prove prescient: XRP could very well be the liquidity backbone of the next financial era.

In a post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.8 million followers that Bitcoin may dip below $90,000 this month based on Bitcoin’s historical trend of performing poorly in August – something he refers to as the “August Curse.” However, Kiyosaki says he will make a massive Bitcoin purchase if its current value declines by more than 21%. “Bitcoin curse: will the Bitcoin ‘August curse’ crash Bitcoin’s price to below $90,000? I hope so. I enjoyed an exciting educational summer attending ‘The Collective’ and ‘Limitless Financial’ education event, learning about what lies ahead with speakers such as Larry Lepard, Jim Rickards and other stock, bond, real estate, gold, silver and Bitcoin geniuses – Rickards, Brent Johnson and many other real teachers who practice what they teach, unlike fake school teachers who have no idea what they teach. If the Bitcoin ‘August curse’ hits and Bitcoin crashed, I stand by to 2x my position today. The problem is not Bitcoin. The real problem is our multi-trillion dollar debt and incompetent PhDs running ‘the swamp,’ the Fed and our Treasury. The Bitcoin ‘August curse’ will make most Bitcoin investors richer.” Bitcoin is trading for $114,973 at time of writing, up marginally on the day.

2025-08-04 18:02:00,49536314,1754330520,"Turn $500 Into $40,000 in 100 Days: These 4 Top Meme Coins Have That Energy.","With communities fueled by humor, hype, and real utility, the meme coin scene is full of opportunities. If you want to turn $500 into $40,000 in the next 100 days, these four meme coins might have the explosive potential to do it. Let’s dive into the coins with the biggest breakout energy right now: Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The First Meme Chain Built for Velocity Current Presale Price: $0.0017 Potential Return to $1: 58,000% Leading the list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —a new meme coin with the most utility-packed launch of 2025. LILPEPE isn’t just a coin; it’s the first Layer-2 blockchain specifically built for meme coins. Little Pepe brings a full-blown ecosystem with zero-tax transactions, sniper bot protection, lightning-fast speeds, and a dedicated meme coin launchpad in an industry where most meme tokens rely on hype. With a hard cap of 100 billion tokens and over 96% of the presale already sold, LILPEPE has already generated buzz among early investors. Backed by a seasoned dev team (with ties to multiple successful meme projects) and two top-tier centralized exchange listings confirmed, LILPEPE is gearing up for an explosive debut. Suppose LILPEPE launches even remotely like PEPE or SHIB, a move from $0.0017 to $1 would turn a $500 presale buy into $294,117. Even a far more conservative target of $0.10 would make your $500 worth over $29,000. This coin isn’t just vibing with the meme trend—it’s leading the next wave of it. BONK: Solana’s Comeback King Ready to Retest ATH Current Price: ~$0.000028 Short-Term Target: $0.000045 (ATH) BONK, the poster child of Solana’s meme coin scene, is back in the spotlight. After a healthy consolidation under Take Profit 2 (TP2) levels, BONK is setting up for another bullish leg up. BONK’s volume is rising, and a breakout above $0.000035 could trigger a run to $0.000045+. The RSI currently sits around 60—far from overbought—leaving ample room for upside. BONK also benefits from wider bullish sentiment in the Solana ecosystem, where upgraded performance and lower fees have reignited investor interest. According to top analyst Pentoshi, BONK is a “high-reward play with cross-ecosystem impact”, and with 10% more wallets added in the last month, the signs point to real, organic growth. From a $500 position, a move from $0.000028 to $0.000045 would already net 60% gains, but if BONK continues to ride the Solana wave, a price of $0.0001 isn’t out of reach, turning your $500 into $1,785 or more. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Meme Coin May Still Have One More Moonshot Current Price: $0.25 2025 Price Prediction: $2.30–$3.00 DOGE isn’t new to the party, but it still knows how to shake up the market. Currently trading at $0.25, Dogecoin has re-entered its historic accumulation zone between $0.15–$0.22, which has previously sparked gains of 900% to 13,000%, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Momentum is building again, with whales accumulating over 1.08 billion DOGE in just two days, worth over $250 million. Volume has spiked past $6.2 billion, and the charts show a breakout above a long-term descending trendline, forming bullish patterns like a rounding bottom and megaphone. Analysts believe DOGE could reclaim the $0.73 resistance (its previous ATH) and possibly surge to $2.30–$3.00 if the market favors risk-on assets. A jump from $0.25 to $3.00 represents a 1,100% return. A $500 investment here could turn into $6,000+, assuming DOGE captures even a fraction of its previous hype-driven surge. Dogwifhat (WIF): Cup-and-Handle Primed for a Breakout Current Price: $1.13 Targets: $1.368 (TP1), $1.82 (TP2) Dogwifhat (WIF) has emerged as another fan-favorite with serious technical bullishness. A textbook cup-and-handle pattern has formed on the 3-day chart, with the handle consolidating cleanly through June and July. Now, it’s approaching a breakout point at $1.368. WIF is trading just below that resistance when writing, having already reclaimed critical support at $1.11. Volume has remained consistently high—$432.7 million traded in the past 24 hours—with strong accumulation signals confirmed by Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at +0.08. The full cup-and-handle extension points to a move toward $1.828, a 60% gain from current levels. WIF could climb even further into price discovery mode if bullish momentum holds. A $500 stake at today’s prices could easily be worth $800–$1,000+ within weeks. And if WIF breaks past $2.00 and heads toward the $3.00+ territory, the upside could multiply. Final Thoughts: Meme Coin Mania Isn’t Over—It’s Just Smarter Meme coins are no longer just hype-driven gambles. The top projects in 2025—Little Pepe, BONK, DOGE, and Dogwifhat—combine technical setups, community engagement, institutional interest, and actual blockchain utility. Whether you’re riding with the OG (DOGE), speculating on a Solana favorite (BONK), chasing technicals (WIF), or betting on the next meme ecosystem (LILPEPE), the key is positioning early and managing risk. In this environment, a $500 bet on the right meme coin could realistically turn into $40,000 or more—if not in 100 days, then certainly over the next leg of the bull cycle.

2025-08-04 18:00:41,49536166,1754330441,"Why DOT and UNI Traders Are Exploring Spartans in 2025: Fast Payouts, Big Bonuses, and 5,963 Ways to Play","Polkadot (DOT) and Uniswap (UNI) are drawing attention again as they test important price levels. DOT has moved above $4.60, with possible targets at $8 and $12. UNI broke past $10.80 and is now pushing toward $15, driven by strong growth from Uniswap v4 and over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Both show potential, but the market remains uncertain. Spartans offers a different use case, delivering real-time benefits. With over 5,900 games, quick crypto withdrawals, and sportsbook access in one place, it’s not about waiting. It’s about using crypto in a way that brings instant value. While DOT and UNI face technical hurdles, Spartans gains user confidence by offering direct utility. For those wanting more than just watching price moves, the question becomes whether to wait for another breakout or engage with a crypto sportsbook already offering results. Polkadot (DOT) Price Strength Points to Long-Term Possibility Polkadot (DOT) has jumped more than 32% in the past 10 days, moving past $4.60 and breaking out of a long-standing trendline. Analysts now look for a move toward $8 or even $12, depending on trading volume and continued buying support. With an RSI of 55.92 and the MACD above its signal line, indicators point to ongoing buying interest. DOT’s momentum is also tied to recent updates on the network. Features like Elastic Scaling and the upcoming JAM protocol are bringing more attention to Polkadot. Gavin Wood’s focus on tools like Proof-of-Personhood has drawn new developer interest, helping to build on-chain strength. Still, traders remain cautious. The long/short ratio sits at 1.06, showing moderate optimism. While the outlook for DOT looks better, many are watching closely to see if it can stay above $5.00 before expecting bigger moves. Uniswap (UNI) Builds Support Around New Features and Growing TVL Uniswap v4 has passed $1.026 billion in TVL within 177 days of launch, showing faster growth than the previous version. Daily trading volumes are steady at about $640 million. Layer 2 networks now account for over 67% of this activity, showing wide usage across DeFi. UNI trades near $10.82, with recent volume up 25%. Analysts are watching for a move toward $15, supported by new tools like Hooks in v4. These tools help liquidity providers automate trades, manage risk, and increase returns. Projects like Bunni and EulerSwap have each passed $1 billion in volume, showing strong support for Uniswap’s latest version. Interest in the UNI price target continues, but there are challenges. Market fatigue and strong competition could slow growth. Unlike Spartans, where features are already live and used, UNI’s next steps rely on broader DeFi adoption. A Look at Why Spartans Is Gaining Attention Among Crypto Sportsbook Users While Polkadot (DOT) and Uniswap (UNI) attract attention with their price movements, Spartans is seeing more users through practical use, offering real features without delay. Spartans.com is a crypto-only site that combines sports betting and online casino games into one easy-to-use platform. It hosts over 5,963 games from more than 43 providers, covering slots, blackjack, crash games, roulette, and live game shows. But it’s not just about offering choices; it’s also about speed. Deposits and withdrawals with BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, and other coins are processed right away, avoiding delays tied to traditional banking. Spartans is also gaining a spot among the safe crypto sportsbooks by providing clear and easy-to-understand bonus offers. These include a 300% casino welcome bonus and a 300% sports bonus, each limited to $200, with rules clearly listed. A 25% daily deposit reward adds more for both casual players and regular users looking for steady activity. Another reason users are taking notice is the sportsbook section, which includes matches from the EPL, NBA, UFC, and other leagues. It supports live betting, live match stats, and fast betslip features. The platform works smoothly on mobile without needing any extra apps. Wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet can be used without issue, making the whole experience more direct and simple. Spartans is also running a giveaway that includes a chance to win a Lamborghini. This offer is open to all users who take part on the site. For users who are not interested in waiting for crypto prices to go up, Spartans offers a different way to use their digital assets actively. Key Takeaways DOT and UNI both have possible upside, but they still depend on market trends and long-term plans. Spartans is working right now by offering over 5,900 games, quick crypto payments, and regular sportsbook rewards that are easy to claim. As some users wait to see if DOT holds above $4.60 or if UNI gets closer to $15, others are already using platforms that deliver value today. Spartans is seen by many as one of the more safe crypto sportsbooks because it focuses on ease of use, useful bonuses, and no waiting time for withdrawals. The real decision for many is no longer between DOT or UNI, but whether to wait or take part now. And for those who choose action, Spartans is becoming the choice that fits better today.

Analysts cite a combination of strong technical indicators, increasing ETF inflows, and intensified whale accumulation as key reasons Ethereum could soon outperform Bitcoin. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ ETH recently broke out of a classic falling wedge pattern, a technical setup often linked to trend reversals. This bullish formation, combined with multiple Relative Strength Index (RSI) taps, suggests Ethereum may be poised for a significant upward move. The RSI behavior mirrors Bitcoin’s movements in early 2021, before it surged to record highs. Adding to the bullish narrative, Ethereum’s RSI has tapped its long-term trendline three times, a rare pattern seen during market bottoms and major trend shifts. ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview $5.4 Billion in Ethereum ETF Inflows Reflect Institutional Confidence Institutional interest in Ethereum is surging. Over the past 20 days, Ethereum ETFs have recorded $5.4 billion in net inflows, with only one day of outflows in July. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF alone accumulated more than $4 billion, while the iShares Ethereum Trust added $1.7 billion across 10 straight trading days. This ETF demand marks a strong signal of growing confidence among professional investors. On-chain data also reveals a 40% surge in Ethereum ETF holdings over the last month, a vertical trajectory that underscores rapid institutional adoption. Whale Accumulation Adds Fuel to Ethereum’s Rally Potential Whales are also aggressively accumulating. More than 200 new whale addresses have been added since early July. Notably, one address reportedly purchased $300 million worth of Ether via OTC deals through Galaxy Digital. Despite recent price dips below $3,400, ETH rebounded to $3,560, signaling strong support and buyer interest. Analysts now see the ETH price forming a base for a sustained rally, especially if price closes above key resistance with rising volume.

2025-08-04 18:00:17,49535825,1754330417,"Stake, Roobet, BC.Game Reviewed – Spartans Is Still the Fastest-Payout Crypto Gambling Site of 2025","As crypto betting continues to grow in 2025, one factor stands above all else for serious players: payout speed. Waiting hours, or worse, days, for a withdrawal can ruin the experience, no matter how great the platform’s games or bonuses are. That’s why fast-payout crypto gambling sites are in high demand. Players now expect withdrawals to be processed quickly, directly to their crypto wallets, without delays or manual checks. This list ranks the six top-performing sites when it comes to payout speed, with Spartans taking the lead thanks to its commitment to instant crypto withdrawals and seamless cashout flows. Spartans: Instant Withdrawals Every Time Spartans stands at the top of the fastest-payout crypto gambling sites in 2025. What sets it apart is its ability to send funds instantly, without the lag most platforms suffer from. Whether players win $10 or $10,000, their crypto hits their wallet almost immediately after withdrawal is requested. There’s no waiting for approvals, no ticket submissions, and no pending status. Spartans handles all transactions through its crypto-native infrastructure, supporting top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and more. Unlike other platforms that rely on slow internal processes, Spartans is built to prioritize speed and trust. The same system used for instant player cashouts is also used for affiliate payments, reinforcing the platform’s reputation for transparency. This reliability turns first-time users into regulars and makes it a favorite among those who value quick access to their winnings. Combined with 5,963+ games, sports betting, and smooth mobile optimization, Spartans proves that fast payouts aren’t just a feature, they’re the standard. Stake.com: Same-Day Processing, Usually Within Hours Stake.com is a well-known name in the crypto gambling space, offering solid reliability and a broad game selection. While not instant, its withdrawals are typically processed within a few hours. High-volume players may occasionally face short delays depending on payout size, but overall, Stake provides a dependable same-day experience for most users. Its speed is solid, though not quite instant. Roobet: Decent Speed, Variable for Larger Wins Roobet ranks high for crypto support and entertainment value, and its payout times are generally acceptable. Most players report withdrawal times between one to four hours depending on network congestion and volume. However, some higher-tier withdrawals may take longer due to additional verification. While not the fastest, Roobet maintains a decent balance between security and speed. BC.Game: Delayed for Manual Review in Some Cases BC.Game processes many crypto withdrawals within a day, but several users have noted occasional manual reviews, especially on large payouts. These reviews can extend processing time significantly, which might frustrate players expecting immediate access. The platform is popular for its bonuses and community features, but speed varies based on amount and user verification level. Betano: Slowest Among Crypto-Enabled Platforms While Betano is trusted for traditional sports betting, its crypto functionality is slower and less optimized than others. Withdrawals often require several hours at best and can take over 24 hours depending on account activity. Crypto is still a secondary option here, making Betano better suited to casual users who aren’t in a rush to cash out. Gamdom: Mixed Reviews on Speed Gamdom supports crypto and has a decent reputation, but payout speeds are inconsistent. Some users report same-day withdrawals, while others wait up to 48 hours depending on token used and identity verification status. It’s a solid platform for variety and game types, but not the best choice if fast payouts are your top priority. Last Say Speed is no longer optional in the world of crypto gambling, it’s expected. While several platforms do a decent job processing withdrawals within the same day, only one consistently delivers instant results: Spartans. From immediate wallet credits to frictionless crypto flows, Spartans leads 2025 as the fastest-payout crypto gambling site. If you’re tired of pending statuses and want your winnings in your wallet right away, Spartans offers a solution that’s both fast and reliable. As more players demand real-time experiences, platforms that delay payouts will continue to fall behind, while instant-withdrawal sites like Spartans become the new standard.

2025-08-04 17:44:43,49535526,1754329483,Google agrees to cut AI data center power use during peak demand,"Reports indicate that Google has become the first U.S. Big Tech company to employ demand-response programs as a resolution to the energy concerns resulting from high AI demand. The rapid growth of AI infrastructure is happening faster than the power grid can adapt, leading to concerns about energy shortages and higher electric bills. As a result, Google has entered into an agreement with two U.S. utilities, Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority, to cut power to its data centers during periods of peak demand. Google agrees to cut AI data center power use during peak demand Google entered into agreements with two U.S. electric utilities, Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority, to curb power usage from its artificial intelligence (AI) data centers during periods of peak electricity demand. The agreement was announced on Monday. The demand for AI-driven services like large language models, real-time data analysis, and machine learning, and the power required to support these functions have increased substantially. Tech companies have ramped up requests for new electricity connections to power AI data centers, especially in regions where available supply is already lagging. Some areas have seen a higher demand for electricity from tech firms than the available electricity capacity. The resulting shortage of energy has raised alarms among grid operators and local communities. Power grids are nearing their limits and concerns have emerged over the potential for higher electricity bills for homes and businesses, increased risk of blackouts, and delays in approving new data center projects. How Google’s new demand-response agreement works Demand-response programs involve temporarily reducing electricity consumption during periods of high demand in exchange for financial compensation or reduced utility rates. They help ease pressure on the power grid, lower emissions, and delay the need to build new transmission infrastructure or power plants. Google’s participation is particularly notable because it involves its machine learning workloads that typically run continuously in massive data centers. Under the agreements, Google will reduce or defer some of these workloads during periods when the utilities request it, allowing more electricity to flow to critical systems and households. According to Google, the flexibility offered by these demand-response efforts “allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids.” The specific commercial details of Google’s agreements have not been made public, but the company may set a precedent for other major tech firms like Microsoft , Amazon, and Meta, all of which are also expanding their AI data center footprints.

Source: DefiLlama While the Total Value Locked (TVL) of $134 billion reflects broader network activity and tokenization beyond just XLM’s DeFi presence, it also shows the substantial economic activity flowing through the Stellar ecosystem. The network is consistently ranked among the top blockchains for cross-border payments, with multi-currency transaction support built in from the outset. Developers and businesses are empowered to build compliant and cost-effective payment solutions that work globally, regardless of local banking infrastructure.

The network has forged major partnerships with global giants like MoneyGram International, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and PayPal, positioning Stellar as a core partner for tokenizing real-world assets and facilitating institutional remittances and payouts. If you want to increase transparency and efficiency, blockchain is the obvious choice. Today, governments, institutions, and businesses rely on the Stellar Disbursement Platform to send and track payments, instantly. @gttyson explains: pic.twitter.com/liarLxuGsC — Stellar (@StellarOrg) May 1, 2025 For instance, PayPal plans to launch its widely anticipated stablecoin PYUSD on the Stellar network. This integration is expected to onboard millions of users into the Stellar ecosystem, especially for cross-border transactions and Pay-Fi (payment-finance) solutions . Further expanding its influence, Visa recently announced support for the Stellar and Avalanche networks, incorporating stablecoins like PYUSD, USDG, and EURC into its international payments framework.

The recent release of Stellar Project 23 , which coincided with a positive price movement for XLM, showcases this ongoing development. Additionally, CAP-67, a structured event generation upgrade, along with new features like Retroactive Events , was featured in Stellar’s July newsletter to improve developer tooling and ecosystem transparency. $XLM/$USDT Builds Rounded Base as Buyers Begin Testing Resistance The 4-hour chart of $XLM reveals a maturing rounded bottom structure that’s pushing into a short-term breakout area near $0.42. The recent move higher from the $0.36 support zone has developed on gradually increasing volume, a sign of organic accumulation rather than purely short liquidations. This sets a different tone from the steep parabolic runs seen earlier in July. The rise in volume over the past few sessions, especially as Stellar’s price approached $0.41, reflects broader participation. That’s an encouraging signs when paired with a clean base formation like this one. $XLM/USDT price chart, August 4 (Source: TradingView) Although the current push is still testing resistance, there are signs of initiative. In the lower time frame volume footprint, we also observed how market participants reacted when the price compresses in a tight range with alternating green and red deltas. On similar structures, the key is not just whether price breaks higher, but whether aggressive buyers step in to follow through. For now, $XLM is showing balanced volume behavior, which supports a continuation bias, but not without a confirmation push. On the momentum front, indicators have turned constructive. RSI has climbed to 56.44, recovering from deeply neutral levels and indicating a mild bullish skew. There’s no divergence, but the slope is positive, and the RSI has crossed its moving average, which tends to precede extension moves. MACD also supports this interpretation. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, while the histogram has flipped green, which indicates that the bullish momentum is picking up for the first time since mid-July. Both indicators still sit in neutral zones, giving room for further upside. Key resistance remains just above at $0.425, which aligns with a previous consolidation area before the July drop. If the price appreciates beyond this level, the next upside target lies near $0.46. Failure to clear $0.415 would keep $XLM in consolidation, though the rounded base structure would remain valid unless price breaks back below $0.384.

2025-08-04 17:30:17,49535098,1754328617,Trump announces new tariffs and massive EU energy commitments,"The European Union (EU) said Monday it’s delaying its planned tariffs on the United States by six months. The duties were originally set to start this week. The European Commission, which speaks for the EU, said the pause is part of a broader deal made between Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump. “On 27 July 2025, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald J. Trump agreed a deal on tariffs and trade,” the EU Commission’s trade spokesperson said. They called the agreement one that brings “stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.” The EU also confirmed it’s working with the U.S. to finalize a Joint Statement, as both leaders agreed in July. The Commission said it would “take the necessary steps to suspend by 6 months the EU’s countermeasures against the U.S., which were due to enter into force on 7 August.” The pause will officially begin on Tuesday, making the move immediate. Trump announces new tariffs and massive EU energy commitments The delay follows Trump’s decision last month to hit most EU goods with a 15% tariff, including cars. That announcement was paired with a statement from the White House claiming the EU would drop its own tariffs on U.S. industrial exports in return. “The EU will remove significant tariffs, including the elimination of all EU tariffs on U.S. industrial goods exported to the EU,” the White House said. Trump didn’t stop there. He also said the 27 EU member countries agreed to buy $750 billion worth of U.S. energy. And on top of that, they’d invest another $600 billion into the U.S., beyond what’s already going in. But nobody has explained who’s actually putting up the money. The EU can’t force private companies to buy U.S. oil or American grain. That part of the deal remains unclear. An EU statement later confirmed that the July 27 deal was a political agreement, not a binding contract. “Beyond taking the immediate actions committed, the EU and the U.S. will further negotiate, in line with their relevant internal procedures, to fully implement the political agreement,” the bloc said. The timing of all this matters. It’s happening as Trump’s broader trade agenda hits another key week. After pushing back deadlines multiple times, Trump just delayed his next round of global tariffs again. The new U.S. duties will now start August 7, not August 1, and will apply to over 60 countries. So far, nobody knows what kind of Joint Statement the EU and the U.S. are putting together. No details have been shared. But the trade spokesperson confirmed both sides are still working on it. For now, the EU’s counter-tariffs are frozen for six months. What happens after that is still wide open. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 sold out early recently. Phase 6 is already live, with the token at $0.035, which is a 16.17% increase from the last phase. Phase 7 of the MUTM presale is going to include a 14.29% rise to $0.04. Investors who enter at this level have a chance of making a 71.43% return on investment when the token reaches $0.06 on launch. MUTM presale has already raised over $14 million in funding and accumulated over 14,800 token holders. XRP Price Update: Holding Near $3 as Broader Focus Shifts XRP is currently trading at $2.98, having recently topped near $3.60 in July before pulling back. Despite relative weakness, XRP remains supported above critical levels around $2.90–$3.00, reinforcing its ability to stay grounded during market fluctuations. Analysts are watching a breakout chart pattern combined with growing institutional sentiment and Ripple’s expanding network usage, which some project could propel price toward $4 to $7+ by year-end if regulatory clarity and ETF developments accelerate. However, risk factors are present: high realized-cap accumulation and daily profit-taking, totaling over $68M in value transfers, could introduce pullback pressure toward $2.50–$2.80, especially if trading volumes weaken. With capital increasingly gravitating toward utility-led DeFi tokens, investor attention is beginning to shift toward protocols like Mutuum Finance. Presale Phase 6 Begins for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance presale is gaining momentum. Over 14,800 investors have invested in the presale and have raised over $14 million. The project is at stage 6 of the presale at $0.035. Investing now will ensure investors a 71.43% Return on Investment. Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto market, not on hype but on utility and scale security, with its innovative dual-lending platform and soon-to-launch USD-pegged stablecoin. Security First: Mutuum Finance Rolls Out $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has recently introduced a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK for a reward of $50,000 USDT. It’s a four-tier reward program i.e., critical, major, minor and low where each level of vulnerability has a reward. This is yet another aspect that says volumes about how forward-thinking Mutuum is in regard to building trust in the middle of good infrastructure and good security. $100K Reward: Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway . 10 participants will receive $10,000 MUTM. In addition to introducing new investors to the project, the giveaway also shows the project’s bid to build a long-term and faithful community base. Mutuum Finance liquidity model allows the user with the ease to use his or her funds in a full, decentralized lending process. The two-model strategy implemented on the platform allows more flexibility and higher efficiency like Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Emphasis on Security and Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to introduce a stablecoin, which will be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain network. It will be a secure and stable investment vehicle to avoid risk and volatility that can be associated with algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping into the spotlight. Over $14 million has been raised, with more than 14,800 holders already on board. Add in a $50,000 bug bounty, $100,000 token giveaway, and CertiK audit 95 trust score, and it’s clear this project is built for long-term growth. Before August ends, make your move.

According to its preliminary prospectus, the company plans to offer 20.3 million ordinary shares at a proposed price range of $28.00 to $31.00 per share. Based on that pricing, the offering could raise between $568 million and $629 million. Bullish has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker BLSH. If approved, it would mark one of the largest public market entries by a crypto firm in 2025. According to Reuters, Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.2 billion through its U.S. IPO, based on the upper end of its proposed price range of $31.00 per share. BlackRock and ARK Show Interest—But No Guarantees The filing discloses that BlackRock and ARK Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, have shown non-binding interest in purchasing up to $200 million worth of shares at the offering price. While the involvement of these heavyweight investors could boost confidence, the filing makes clear that their interest is not a formal commitment, and the final allocation is subject to underwriter discretion. Bullish is incorporated as a foreign private issuer under U.S. law, allowing it to benefit from reduced disclosure obligations. Each ordinary share will carry one vote, maintaining a straightforward governance structure. The underwriters also hold a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,045,000 shares, which could increase the total offering by as much as $94 million before underwriting costs. The digital asset space has seen several public listings in 2025. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, and its shares have surged more than sevenfold since going public. @Circle the company behind the USDC stablecoin, made a dramatic entrance on the NYSE with its shares surging as much as 160% during its trading debut. #Circle #NYSE https://t.co/EJQJ4Yy3m3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 5, 2025 Testing Appetite for Institutional Crypto Infrastructure Founded during the 2021 crypto bull cycle, Bullish is backed by a consortium of institutional players, including Thiel’s Founders Fund, Galaxy Digital, and others.

2025-08-04 17:19:33,49534173,1754327973,Major Cardano (ADA) Community Announcement: Details,"TL;DR Cardano’s community overwhelmingly approved multi-million-dollar funding to support the further progress of the blockchain protocol. Despite the news, ADA’s price remains in the red on a weekly scale, while analysts remain split on its future trajectory. The Community Said ‘Yes’ Input Output Global, the core development team behind the Cardano blockchain, has been approved for funding for its protocol roadmap proposal. The sum equals roughly $71 million worth of ADA and will be taken from the Cardano treasury – a fund that accumulates tokens over time and is used to finance ecosystem developments . The proposal received overwhelming support, with 74% of voters clicking “yes.” Tim Harrison – EVP Community & Ecosystem at Input Output – described this as “a milestone moment” for Cardano and noted that this is the first time a core protocol development will be funded directly by the community. “This vote of confidence empowers us to move forward with full transparency, shared responsibility, and a renewed commitment to building an open, resilient ecosystem,” Harrison added. The team will use the capital to implement several key upgrades, including unlocking higher throughput without compromising security or decentralization, improving Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution Hydra, laying the technical groundwork for more advanced smart contracts, reducing operational costs for stake pool operators, and more. Ricky Rand (General Manager at Input Output) and Charles Hoskinson (co-founder of Cardano) also chipped in. The former said the securing of this funding is “just the start,” adding that the real work begins now. Hoskinson shared the news on his personal X account, expressing gratitude to the community for their support and trust. “Let’s get it done,” he added. ADA Price Outlook The news of the approved funding emerged over the weekend, but it didn’t trigger any price spike for Cardano’s native token. In fact, ADA briefly dipped below $0.70 on August 2 before rebounding slightly to its current level of $0.74 (per CoinGecko data). ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko The community is split in their predictions about the asset’s next potential move. Some believe the valuation could soon exceed $3 and tap a new all-time high of over $4. Others like Ali Martinez, though, made more bearish forecasts.

2025-08-04 17:15:24,49534296,1754327724,Chainlink launches Data Streams to power tokenized U.S. stocks,"Chainlink has launched Chainlink Data Streams for U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to power tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). DeFi protocols such as Kamino, GMX, and GMX-Solana have already adopted the Data Streams. The blockchain network also revealed that its Data Streams are providing pricing for TradFi assets, including SPY, CRCL, QQQ, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, and others. According to the report, the Data Streams are available across 37 different blockchain networks. Chainlink offers more investment options for developers We’re excited to launch Chainlink Data Streams for U.S. equities & ETFs—real-time, low-latency data to power the next generation of tokenized RWA markets. https://t.co/CwKVkUnZxO These new Data Streams are being adopted by top DeFi protocols, including @GMX_IO , @KaminoFinance ,… — Chainlink (@chainlink) August 4, 2025 The decentralized Oracle network said Data Streams aims to provide real-time data for U.S. equities and ETFs on-chain. The structure will also enable developers to use U.S. equities and ETFs for tokenized stock trading, perpetual futures, and synthetic ETFs. Jone Ze, GMX Communications, believes that Data Streams deliver decentralized, institutional-grade pricing infrastructure that could advance DeFi beyond crypto-native assets. On-chain data showed that the tokenized assets market is growing, currently at $275 billion. “With Chainlink Data Streams’ fast, reliable, and context-rich market data, production-ready tokenized financial products tied to U.S. equities and ETFs can now be launched directly on-chain.” – Johann Eid , Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs. The RWA market is expected to surpass $30 trillion by 2030. Thomas Short, co-founder of Kamino, also hopes that U.S. stock and ETF Data Streams will create an on-chain system that matches the scale and sophistication of traditional markets. Chainlink revealed that its infrastructure aims to address some challenges with tokenized equities and ETF products, including market hours tracking, staleness detection, circuit breaker readiness, and event-aware logic. The company believes those challenges could expose tokenized products to potential mispricings, unfair liquidations, regulatory gaps, and other risks. The firm said its Data Centers provide contextual market metadata to power applications. The supported metadata will also include pricing algorithms aggregated from Finalto, Tiingo, and Finnhub. The Data Centers will have a market status indicator to determine market hours logic and a LastUpdate Timestamp for applications to assess data freshness. They will also have a circuit breaker ready to support protocols from trading halts, stock suspensions, or U.S. exchange outages. Data Streams combine inputs from multiple data sources and processes them through decentralized oracle networks (DONs). The system uses a structured schema – designed to advance DeFi composability – to deliver the data sources on-chain. Chainlink plans future upgrade for Data Streams The company said a structured schema can also differentiate between real-world prices and tokenized stock prices. Both data types also unlock arbitrage opportunities and support the development of strategies to capture price spreads. According to Chainlink, Data Streams allows for perpetual trading for U.S. equities and ETFs. The protocol allows users to include tokenized U.S. stocks and funds on-chain for lending and borrowing. Chainlink will also permit users to combine multiple Data Streams to create custom index products. The company believes that Data Streams for U.S. equities and ETFs have come at a time when the tokenized asset industry is ready to bring capital markets on-chain. The company also announced future plans to expand coverage of equities and ETFs, and add support for additional asset classes such as forex, commodities, and OTC markets. Chainlink plans to scale its ongoing partner integrations and contextual data capabilities. Chainlink SDK and other developer tooling updates will also come soon.

2025-08-04 17:05:09,49533643,1754327109,Experienced Analyst Announces Bitcoin Peak Prediction! Date for Bear Market!,"Bitcoin (BTC) suffered a major decline, falling below $112,000 over the weekend with losses of around 4%. While this decline has made investors nervous, a market analyst noted that Bitcoin has not yet reached its peak. The analyst added that Bitcoin will rise to around $140,000 this year, then enter a bear market in 2026. According to Coindesk, Ledn chief investment officer John Glover said that according to the Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin could reach $140,000. Glover stated that the sell-off was a temporary break and a typical pullback wave following the ATH, and that these declines could pave the way for a rally towards $140,000 by the end of the year. “Bitcoin is completely caught up in the summer slump. It continues to follow the expected trajectory on the Elliot Wave chart and will soon complete the 5-wave movement shown by the blue line. This will also complete wave 3 (yellow line) of Wave 5 (orange line). So, all in all, we are on track to reach the $135,000-$140,000 target by the end of 2025.” According to Elliot Wave theory, the analyst said BTC could reach a peak of $130,000 in the next few weeks, then complete a pullback wave by dropping to around $110,000 in September. The larger recent impulse wave would then continue, reaching a bull market peak of around $140,000. The analyst lastly claimed that the bear market will begin in 2026. *This is not investment advice.

According to the data, a wallet holding just over 2,486 XRP now places its owner in the top 10% of XRP accounts. Furthermore, a balance of 50,637 XRP is enough to rank within the top 1% of wallets by holdings. The chart shared by Squire, originally compiled from publicly available ledger data, breaks down the XRP distribution into percentage brackets ranging from the top 0.01% to the top 10%. At the extreme top, only 663 wallets qualify for the 0.01% tier, each holding over 5.73 million XRP. The 0.1% bracket includes wallets with at least 369,080 XRP, while 0.5% of wallets hold over 100,000 XRP. According to the chart, the top 1% begins at just over 50,637 XRP. $XRP Rich List just dropped 2,500 XRP puts you in the top 10%. 50,650 XRP? That’s the 1% club. Still think you're ""just getting started""? Check again. You might already be ahead of 99%. pic.twitter.com/V3RD3XYadY — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 3, 2025 Squire’s View: Many XRP Holders Underestimate Their Position Squire commented that many XRP holders might underestimate their positioning within the broader ecosystem. He suggested that some individuals who believe they are “just getting started” may already be ahead of 99% of accounts based on the current wallet data. This sentiment, intended to motivate holders, was grounded in the interpretation of the wallet distribution figures. However, the data has also prompted scrutiny from several users within the XRP community who questioned its accuracy and usefulness. Community Pushback on Wallet-Based Metrics One user, identified as PAPA2MAXX, argued that the figures provided in the list may not present a clear or reliable picture of actual ownership distribution. According to this user, many individuals hold XRP across multiple wallets, which significantly skews the data. They further claimed that the number of people truly holding over 50,000 XRP is much smaller than the list implies, estimating it to be closer to around 1,200 individuals rather than the 66,330 accounts identified as representing the top 1%. Another community member, DanielThaLion, echoed this concern by stating that he holds XRP across five different wallets. He also emphasized that many of the highest-balance wallets are custodial accounts owned by centralized exchanges. These large wallets may represent the combined assets of thousands of users, but in such reports, they are treated as single wallet holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additionally, users who store their XRP on exchanges do not appear individually on such lists, as their balances are aggregated into exchange wallets, further distorting the actual distribution of wealth among individual holders. Challenges in Assessing Ownership Distribution These concerns highlight a broader challenge in interpreting blockchain data for asset distribution. Wallet count does not equate to individual holders, and the presence of multi-wallet users and exchange custodians significantly complicates any attempt to assess wealth concentration. While John Squire’s update presents a factual breakdown of wallet balances based on ledger data, it may not fully represent the distribution of XRP ownership across individuals. Nevertheless, the figures remain useful as a general benchmark for understanding wallet stratification. According to the data, wallets holding at least 16,299 XRP are within the top 3%, while those with 8,758 XRP make it into the top 5%. The 10% mark, as referenced by Squire, stands at just above 2,486 XRP. This positioning framework provides a comparative look at holdings, although it cannot offer a definitive picture of how many individuals hold these balances.

In a new interview on the Goldman Sachs YouTube channel, Anshul Sehgal, the bank’s co-head of fixed income, currency and commodities, says that the future looks bright for markets as tailwinds from the US, China and Germany. “In 2026, we are seeing nothing but good news for the global economy. You’ve got Germany fiscally expanding because of defense, you’ve got [Trump’s] big beautiful bill, which has potential, especially in conjunction with AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics, to unleash a credit boom domestically in addition to the fiscal expansion we’ve witnessed over the last four years. Similarly, [we expect] China to continue to hold on to its perch in AI and robotics [and is] already expanding in both credit and fiscal terms. So the combination of those things globally essentially means that you’re going to get asset price appreciation in the intermediate term.” Sehgal goes on to say that in the near term, tariffs will likely create a one-time setback for the markets as either corporations or consumers will have to take the hit. “In the very near-term, because tariffs are on corporations, if they absorb the losses – the number we’re talking about is $250 billion to $300 billion annualized – based on where things are falling, that’s about 1% of the GDP, it’s a non-trivial amount. That, if it’s absorbed by the corporates, would have an impact on stocks, and if it’s absorbed by the consumer, it would impact consumption in the near term. It is a one-time tax, though, so once it’s factored and starting early next year, once you’ve got the bonus depreciation that’s in the big beautiful bill, you’ve got the social security tax benefits and the lower taxes on tips. The combination of those things are very powerful for the US economy in our view.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-08-04 06:55:10,49509342,1754290510,Bitcoin Reserves: Capital B’s Strategic $13.3 Million Raise Fuels BTC Growth,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserves: Capital B’s Strategic $13.3 Million Raise Fuels BTC Growth In a significant move echoing growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Capital B, a publicly listed company based in Europe, has recently announced a substantial fundraising round. The primary objective? To bolster its Bitcoin reserves . This strategic decision highlights a broader trend of traditional companies increasingly integrating cryptocurrencies into their balance sheets, recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. What’s Driving Capital B’s Bitcoin Reserves Strategy? Capital B’s recent capital raise of approximately €11.5 million ($13.3 million) to expand its Bitcoin holdings, as reported by NLNico (@btcNLNico) on X, isn’t just a financial transaction; it’s a statement. This move underscores several key motivations that are becoming increasingly common among forward-thinking corporations: Inflation Hedging: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply, making it an attractive asset for preserving purchasing power. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin is often dubbed “digital gold” due to its scarcity and perceived store-of-value properties, making it a compelling alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Strategic Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries provides diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Investor Demand: A growing number of institutional and retail investors are seeking exposure to Bitcoin, and companies holding BTC can attract this segment of the market. This commitment to increasing Bitcoin reserves reflects a sophisticated understanding of evolving financial landscapes. How Does Increasing Bitcoin Reserves Impact a Public Company? For a publicly listed entity like Capital B, the decision to accumulate significant Bitcoin reserves carries both opportunities and responsibilities. It signals a progressive approach to treasury management, but also requires careful consideration of market volatility and regulatory environments. Consider the following aspects: Aspect Opportunity Consideration Market Perception Innovator, forward-thinking Potential for investor skepticism Balance Sheet Strength Asset appreciation potential Volatility impact on financials Operational Costs Reduced inflation erosion Custody and security expenses Regulatory Landscape Potential for clear guidelines Evolving regulations, compliance The successful execution of this strategy will depend on Capital B’s ability to navigate the complexities of digital asset management while maintaining transparency with its shareholders regarding its Bitcoin reserves . What Are the Broader Implications for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Capital B’s move is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger narrative of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. From MicroStrategy’s pioneering corporate treasury strategy to Tesla’s past Bitcoin acquisitions, the trend of companies adding BTC to their balance sheets is gaining momentum. This growing institutional embrace has several significant implications: Legitimization of Crypto: Each new corporate adoption lends further credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond speculative investment. Increased Liquidity: As more institutions hold Bitcoin, it contributes to deeper market liquidity, potentially reducing price volatility over time. Infrastructure Development: Institutional demand drives the development of more robust and secure custody solutions, trading platforms, and financial products for digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: The presence of established companies in the crypto space often prompts regulators to develop clearer guidelines, fostering a more stable environment for all participants. The strategic decision to build substantial Bitcoin reserves by a European publicly listed company serves as a powerful testament to the digital asset’s enduring appeal and growing acceptance in mainstream finance. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses Regarding Bitcoin Reserves For individuals and businesses watching these developments, Capital B’s action provides valuable insights into the evolving investment landscape. It underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s role in modern portfolios. Here are some actionable takeaways: Research and Due Diligence: Before considering any Bitcoin investment, whether personal or corporate, conduct thorough research into its fundamentals, market dynamics, and associated risks. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin can offer significant upside, it should generally be part of a diversified portfolio, rather than the sole investment. Long-Term Perspective: Many institutional investors, including those building Bitcoin reserves , adopt a long-term view, understanding that short-term volatility is part of the asset’s journey. Security Measures: For businesses holding significant crypto assets, robust security protocols for custody are paramount. This includes multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and professional third-party custodians. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic. Keep abreast of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s value and adoption. Capital B’s move serves as a compelling case study for the increasing integration of digital assets into traditional financial strategies, particularly regarding the strategic accumulation of Bitcoin reserves . Capital B’s successful fundraising of $13.3 million specifically to increase its Bitcoin reserves marks a significant milestone in the ongoing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As a publicly listed European company, its decision sends a strong signal about the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This strategic move highlights Bitcoin’s role as a potential inflation hedge, a diversifier, and a valuable asset in a modern corporate treasury. While the journey of integrating digital assets into traditional finance has its complexities, Capital B’s proactive step exemplifies a forward-thinking approach that could inspire many others. The narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate and powerful financial asset continues to strengthen, driven by such decisive actions from established entities.

The rally was driven by consistent accumulation and large holder activity, with key breakouts at $0.194, $0.196, and $0.198. However, the token failed to maintain momentum above the $0.20 resistance and reversed during the final hour of trading, indicating a short-term top and setting the stage for a potential consolidation phase.

2025-08-04 06:51:58,49510061,1754290318,"From $0.035 to $3, MUTM could deliver 100x before the bull run peaks","Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Stablecoin and mtToken Mechanics At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a powerful triad: a decentralized stablecoin, interest-bearing mtTokens, and a robust lending engine running on a Layer-2 network. Unlike speculative tokens with little use case, this ecosystem is purpose-built for long-term value generation. When users deposit blue-chip assets like ETH, USDC, or DAI into the protocol, they will receive mtTokens issued on a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens will not just represent ownership—they will grow in value as they accrue interest, and can be staked in smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards from protocol revenue. The demand loop here is clear: as more users deposit to earn yield, the supply of mtTokens will rise. Staking them unlocks MUTM distributions, encouraging users to participate long-term instead of selling. Once the platform goes live, every new deposit and interaction is expected to create positive demand pressure on the MUTM token, reinforcing its market position beyond the listing phase. This isn’t just another DeFi promise—it’s a utility-focused ecosystem ready to tap into the growing appetite for sustainable passive income tools. Presale momentum signals the last entry window Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in Presale Phase 6, offering tokens at just $0.035. Over $13.85 million has already been raised, with 7% of Phase 6’s 170 million tokens already sold to more than 14,800 holders. The next price increase to $0.040 represents a 15% hike, meaning buyers today already step in at a discount before the official listing price of $0.06. This presale phase is not just a discounted buying opportunity—it’s the last early-entry point before demand could spike significantly. The upcoming beta launch, slated in the roadmap’s next development phase, is expected to introduce real usage into the ecosystem. When users begin interacting with the mtToken staking system and the stablecoin issuance model, the value proposition will become tangible. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is executing a clear 4-phase roadmap that begins with its foundational steps: smart contract auditing, presale tracking, and initial community growth. The protocol has already secured a CertiK audit with strong results—Token Score of 95 and Skynet rating of 78, signaling a serious commitment to security. The next phase focuses on launching the beta version of its lending and staking protocol, followed by stablecoin deployment and full Layer-2 integration. With more than 12,000 Twitter followers already supporting the movement, momentum is building fast. A $100,000 giveaway is live, giving 10 early investors a chance to win $10,000 worth of MUTM each. Engagement is climbing, awareness is spreading—and the clock is ticking for Phase 6 buyers. Why $3 isn’t a stretch for MUTM When comparing early movers to those just entering now, the rewards are already substantial. Investors who converted $5,000 worth of SOL into MUTM during Phase 1 at $0.01 are now holding tokens valued around $30,000—a 6x gain even before listing. But the real upside is ahead. At a projected post-launch price of $3, those same tokens would be worth a staggering $500,000—a full 100x return. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart isn’t hype—it’s structure. Once the beta platform is operational, user interaction will increase. The protocol’s appeal lies in practical utility: earning APY through mtTokens, participating in P2C lending, and locking assets to mint a decentralized stablecoin. As these features roll out, the demand for MUTM tokens is expected to intensify. Additionally, once MUTM begins listing on major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, or Coinbase, it will gain visibility among millions of traders seeking the next big DeFi breakout. Visibility leads to trust. Trust leads to investment. And investment drives the price upward. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting up for something rare—an actual use-case-driven protocol with a direct path to mass adoption. As Phase 6 quickly sells out, the current entry point may soon become a missed opportunity. With listing not far away and DeFi’s resurgence gaining steam, the road to $3 doesn’t just look possible—it looks earned.

2025-08-04 06:50:11,49509084,1754290211,Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Smarter Web Company’s Bold $10.75M Move,"BitcoinWorld Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Smarter Web Company’s Bold $10.75M Move In the dynamic world of digital finance, a compelling trend is reshaping corporate balance sheets: the adoption of Bitcoin. Companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets to embrace the potential of cryptocurrencies. One such player making waves is the U.K.-based web development firm, Smarter Web Company (SWC), which recently made a significant move that underscores the growing interest in a strategic Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . What is Smarter Web Company’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? Smarter Web Company has announced a remarkable fundraising achievement, securing £8.1 million, equivalent to $10.75 million. This capital was raised through a placing and subscription of nearly 4 million new ordinary shares, each priced at £2.05. But what makes this particular fundraising notable is the stated purpose behind it: to acquire more Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t SWC’s first foray into the world of digital assets. The company had previously outlined its intention to invest in Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value and a strategic asset. As of July 30, SWC already held a substantial 2,050 BTC. This new injection of capital is set to significantly bolster their existing Bitcoin reserves, reinforcing their commitment to a long-term Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . The decision by a web development firm to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin speaks volumes about the evolving perception of cryptocurrencies among businesses. It highlights a strategic shift where digital assets are no longer seen as niche investments but as integral components of a diversified corporate treasury. Why Are Companies Embracing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? Smarter Web Company’s move is part of a broader trend. A growing number of corporations are exploring or implementing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . But what drives this shift? Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s appeal for corporate treasuries: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing inflation concerns, Bitcoin is viewed by many as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply offer a compelling alternative to traditional monetary systems. Digital Gold Narrative: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with the precious metal, such as scarcity and durability. Companies are looking to Bitcoin to preserve capital in the long term. Balance Sheet Optimization: For some, holding Bitcoin is a way to optimize their balance sheet, potentially generating returns that outpace traditional low-yield investments while diversifying asset exposure. Market Trend and Innovation: Aligning with the cutting edge of financial innovation can also be a driver. Companies that embrace digital assets are often seen as forward-thinking and adaptable. To better understand the motivations, let’s look at a simplified comparison of traditional cash holdings versus a Bitcoin allocation: Aspect Traditional Cash Holdings Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Inflation Exposure High (Purchasing power erosion) Potential Hedge (Fixed supply) Yield Potential Low (Bank interest) High (Price appreciation) Volatility Low High Accessibility High Varies (Custody solutions) Navigating the Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, adopting a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy is not without its challenges. Companies must carefully consider potential hurdles to ensure a robust and secure investment: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings. Corporations must be prepared for the potential for substantial unrealized gains or losses on their balance sheets, which can impact quarterly earnings reports and investor perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions. Changes in regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or operational aspects of holding digital assets. Custody and Security: Securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and robust security protocols to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. This often necessitates partnerships with professional custodians. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment for Bitcoin holdings can be complex and varies by region. Companies need expert advice to correctly report their digital assets and manage tax obligations. These challenges underscore the importance of thorough due diligence and a well-thought-out plan before embarking on a significant Bitcoin investment. Beyond Smarter Web: Other Pioneers in Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Smarter Web Company is certainly a notable example, but they stand on the shoulders of other corporate giants who have paved the way for a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . Perhaps the most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value has inspired many other firms. Another well-known case is Tesla, which famously invested a substantial amount in Bitcoin and briefly accepted it for payments, though their strategy has seen some adjustments. Similarly, Block (formerly Square), led by Jack Dorsey, has also made significant Bitcoin purchases and is actively involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem through initiatives like Bitcoin mining and decentralized exchange development. These examples illustrate that the decision to integrate Bitcoin into corporate treasuries is not limited to tech firms or crypto-native companies; it’s a strategic consideration for a diverse range of industries.

2025-08-04 06:45:10,49508905,1754289910,South Korea Stablecoin: Revolutionary Progress in Digital Payments,"BitcoinWorld South Korea Stablecoin: Revolutionary Progress in Digital Payments The digital payment landscape in South Korea is on the cusp of a significant transformation. As global interest in stablecoins intensifies, major players in the nation’s tech and finance sectors are making strategic moves to integrate these digital assets into everyday transactions. The spotlight is currently on the burgeoning efforts to launch a South Korea stablecoin , particularly one pegged to the Korean Won (KRW). This initiative promises to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, offering new possibilities for efficiency and accessibility in payments. Recent reports indicate that mobile financial platform Toss, a product of Viva Republica, is engaging in discussions with leading crypto exchange Bithumb. Their objective? To develop a stablecoin-based payment system. This mirrors a similar, high-profile collaboration already underway between Naver Pay, the digital payment arm of internet giant Naver, and Upbit, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange operated by Dunamu. These parallel developments signal a robust and competitive push towards establishing a dominant KRW-pegged stablecoin, potentially reshaping how South Koreans manage and spend their money. What is Driving the South Korea Stablecoin Rush? South Korea has long been a global leader in technological adoption and digital innovation. Its citizens are highly accustomed to mobile payments and online transactions, creating a fertile ground for the evolution of digital currency. The nation’s advanced digital infrastructure and high internet penetration rates make it an ideal testbed for new financial technologies like a South Korea stablecoin . Several factors are fueling this intense interest and development: Technological Readiness: South Korea boasts one of the world’s most digitally connected populations, with widespread use of mobile banking and payment apps. This existing comfort with digital transactions provides a strong foundation for stablecoin adoption. Government and Regulatory Stance: While cautious, South Korean regulators have shown an increasing willingness to explore blockchain and digital assets. Clearer regulatory frameworks are emerging, providing a more stable environment for innovation. Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Stablecoins offer the potential for faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions compared to traditional payment rails, especially for cross-border remittances. Competitive Landscape: The race between giants like Toss/Bithumb and Naver/Upbit reflects a recognition of stablecoins as a future pillar of the digital economy. No major player wants to be left behind in this evolving financial landscape. Here is a comparison of the key players and their reported stablecoin initiatives: Entity Key Partner(s) Reported Initiative Potential Impact Toss (Viva Republica) Bithumb Stablecoin-based payment system Integrate crypto into daily mobile finance Naver Pay (Naver) Upbit (Dunamu) KRW-pegged stablecoin collaboration Leverage e-commerce giant’s user base for adoption How Will a KRW-Pegged South Korea Stablecoin Function? A South Korea stablecoin pegged to the Korean Won would function similarly to other fiat-backed stablecoins like USDT or USDC, but with the specific backing of KRW. This means that for every stablecoin issued, an equivalent amount of Korean Won would be held in reserve, ensuring its price stability. This stability is crucial, as it mitigates the notorious volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies, making stablecoins suitable for everyday transactions and financial services. The potential applications for a KRW-pegged stablecoin are vast and varied: Daily Payments and E-commerce: Imagine paying for groceries or online shopping using a digital KRW stablecoin directly from your mobile wallet, with transactions settling almost instantly. Remittances: Sending money to or from South Korea could become significantly faster and cheaper, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries and their associated fees and delays. Cross-border Trade: Businesses could use stablecoins for international payments, reducing foreign exchange risks and transaction costs. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are a cornerstone of DeFi, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn yield in a stable environment without exposure to volatile assets. The benefits extend beyond mere convenience. A widely adopted South Korea stablecoin could foster greater financial inclusion by providing accessible digital financial services to a broader population, including those who may be underserved by traditional banking systems. It could also enhance the transparency of financial flows, as transactions on a blockchain are immutable and verifiable. What Challenges Lie Ahead for South Korea Stablecoin Projects? While the prospects for a South Korea stablecoin are promising, several significant challenges must be addressed for successful implementation and widespread adoption. These hurdles span regulatory, technical, and societal dimensions: Regulatory Clarity and Oversight: The biggest challenge remains the evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide, including South Korea, are grappling with how to classify and regulate stablecoins. Questions persist regarding consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. The potential for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) also adds a layer of complexity, as private stablecoins would need to coexist or integrate with national digital currency initiatives. Trust and Adoption: Despite South Korea’s tech-savviness, building public trust in a new digital currency requires significant effort. Users need assurance about the stability of the peg, the security of their funds, and the reliability of the underlying technology. Education and transparent communication will be vital. Technological Scalability and Interoperability: For a stablecoin to handle millions of daily transactions, the underlying blockchain infrastructure must be highly scalable and robust. Furthermore, ensuring interoperability with existing financial systems and other blockchain networks is crucial for seamless integration and broad utility. Competition with Existing Payment Systems: South Korea already has a highly efficient and entrenched digital payment ecosystem. Stablecoins must offer compelling advantages in terms of speed, cost, or unique features to truly displace or significantly augment established payment methods like credit cards, bank transfers, and existing mobile payment apps. Reserve Management and Auditing: Maintaining the KRW peg requires meticulous management of reserves, which must be fully backed and regularly audited by independent third parties to ensure transparency and prevent systemic risks. Actionable Insights: Navigating the South Korea Stablecoin Landscape The emergence of a South Korea stablecoin presents both opportunities and considerations for various stakeholders. Understanding these dynamics can help individuals and businesses prepare for the future of digital finance: For Consumers: Stay informed about developments. While the convenience of stablecoins is appealing, understand the underlying technology and the entities issuing them. Look for stablecoins that are fully backed by transparent reserves and regulated by appropriate authorities. Consider how stablecoins could simplify your daily transactions or cross-border payments. For Businesses: Explore the potential for integrating stablecoin payments into your operations. This could include accepting stablecoins for goods and services, streamlining supply chain payments, or facilitating international transactions. Early adopters may gain a competitive edge by offering more efficient and potentially cheaper payment options to customers. Consider partnering with payment processors or platforms that support stablecoin transactions. For Developers and Innovators: The push for a South Korea stablecoin creates new opportunities for building innovative applications and services on top of these digital currencies. This could range from new payment gateways to DeFi protocols tailored for the KRW market. Focus on user experience, security, and compliance. For Regulators and Policymakers: Continue to foster a balanced approach that encourages innovation while ensuring financial stability, consumer protection, and compliance with global standards. Clear guidelines for stablecoin issuance, reserve management, and operational resilience are paramount to building a trusted digital currency ecosystem. The collaborative efforts between major tech and crypto entities underscore a significant shift towards integrating blockchain-based solutions into mainstream finance. The lessons learned from the development of a South Korea stablecoin will undoubtedly provide valuable insights for other nations exploring similar initiatives. In conclusion, the race to launch a KRW-pegged South Korea stablecoin by industry titans like Toss, Bithumb, Naver, and Upbit marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital payments. While challenges remain, the potential for faster, cheaper, and more accessible financial services is immense. This ambitious undertaking not only positions South Korea at the forefront of digital currency innovation but also sets a precedent for how traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology can converge to create a more efficient and interconnected global economy. The coming years will reveal the full impact of these revolutionary developments on daily life and commerce. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin?

It achieves this by pegging its value to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency (like the US dollar or Korean Won), a commodity (like gold), or a basket of assets. Q2: Why are South Korean companies interested in creating a KRW-pegged stablecoin? South Korean companies are interested in KRW-pegged stablecoins to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology (speed, low cost, transparency) while maintaining price stability. This allows for more efficient digital payments, remittances, and integration into existing financial services without the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. Q3: How will a South Korea stablecoin impact daily payments? A widely adopted South Korea stablecoin could enable faster, cheaper, and more seamless digital payments for everyday transactions, online shopping, and even international remittances. It would integrate into existing mobile payment platforms, offering an alternative to traditional banking methods. Q4: What are the main differences between Toss/Bithumb and Naver/Upbit’s stablecoin projects? While both aim for KRW-pegged stablecoins, Toss and Bithumb are reportedly focused on a stablecoin-based payment system. Naver Pay and Upbit are collaborating on a KRW-pegged stablecoin, potentially leveraging Naver’s vast e-commerce and digital services ecosystem for adoption. Both represent significant efforts to integrate stablecoins into mainstream finance. Q5: What are the primary regulatory concerns for stablecoins in South Korea? Key regulatory concerns include consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) compliance, ensuring reserve backing and transparency, and managing the interplay between private stablecoins and potential Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Q6: Will a South Korea stablecoin replace traditional banking services? It is unlikely that a South Korea stablecoin will completely replace traditional banking services in the short term. Instead, it is more likely to act as a complementary technology, offering new payment rails and financial products that can integrate with and enhance existing banking infrastructure.

2025-08-04 06:42:45,49510571,1754289765,"Bitcoin Still on Track for $140K This Year, But 2026 Will be Painful: Elliott Wave Expert","Don't call the top yet, market analyst specializing in the Elliott wave theory, told CoinDesk. He added that bitcoin (BTC) will rally to around $140,000 this year before slipping into a bear market in 2026. The leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped 4% over the past week, with prices hitting lows under $112,000 over the weekend, according to CoinDesk data. The decline comes after weeks of profit-taking by long-term holders near $120,000 and alongside sharp losses in key crypto-related stocks such as Strategy (MSTR) and Coinbase (COIN). The sell-off is a typical retracement wave, representing a temporary breather from the preceding bullish impulse wave, and could set the stage for a rally to $140,000 by year-end, according to John Glover, chief investment officer at crypto financial services company Ledn. ""Firmly caught in the summer doldrums, the BTC price continues to follow the expected trajectory and will soon complete the 5-wave move depicted by the blue line [in the chart] below, which will finish wave iii (yellow line) of Wave 5 (orange line). All to say, we're still on target to hit $135,000 - $140,000 by the end of 2025,"" Glover said in an email. What is the Elliott Wave? The Elliott Wave Theory, introduced by Ralph Nelson Elliott in 1938 in his book, "" The Wave Principle , is a way of understanding market movements by recognizing that they follow predictable, repeating patterns like natural fractals. The core idea is that crowd psychology moves in cycles, creating a pattern of five waves in the direction of the primary trend or the impulse move. The five-wave structure encompasses three impulse waves (1,3, and 5) and two retracing waves (2 and 4). Sometimes, impulse waves are extended and powerful, comprising their own 5-wave structure. A three-wave corrective structure follows the five-wave structure. This 5-3 wave pattern repeats at both larger and smaller scales, allowing observers to forecast future price action based on the market's current position within the broader context. According to the above chart, BTC is currently moving in the impulse wave (iii) of the extended impulse wave 5. The impulse wave (iii) could hit a high of $130,000 in the next couple of weeks, before prices drop to around $110,000 in September, completing the retrace wave (iv). After that, the final impulse wave (v) of the larger impulse wave 5 will resume, marking a bull market peak at around $140,000. ""Once we achieve the $140,000-ish region, there will be a LOT of debate as to how much further the market will go, and I'm sure we'll hear the bulls quoting $250,000 to $500,000 in 2026. This is not my thesis as I believe we will enter a bear market for BTC in 2026,"" Glover said. Glover's take contrasts with the popular narrative that institutional adoption through ETFs has broken bitcoin's four-year cycles, which historically indicate a price peak this year followed by an extended bear market.

2025-08-04 06:40:10,49508642,1754289610,UK Crypto Regulation: A Dire Warning as Britain Risks Falling Behind,"BitcoinWorld UK Crypto Regulation: A Dire Warning as Britain Risks Falling Behind The world of digital assets is evolving at an incredible pace, promising to reshape finance as we know it. Yet, a recent stark warning from former U.K. Chancellor George Osborne suggests that Britain is dangerously close to being left behind in this transformative shift. His concerns highlight a critical need for decisive UK crypto regulation , comparing the current situation to the pivotal ‘Big Bang’ financial reforms of the 1980s. For anyone invested in the future of finance, particularly cryptocurrencies, this assessment signals a moment of truth for the UK’s strategic position. Why is UK Crypto Regulation Lagging? George Osborne, a key figure in recent British financial history, did not mince words in his Financial Times op-ed. He specifically called out current Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey for what he perceives as a slow and hesitant approach to crypto and stablecoin policy. His central argument is that while the potential for innovation is immense, the lack of a clear, comprehensive legal framework for UK crypto regulation is stifling progress. Lack of Clear Legal Framework: Osborne emphasizes the absence of a defined legal structure, similar to the clarity provided by the U.S. Congress for its digital asset markets. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to operate and innovate confidently within the UK. Bureaucratic Inertia: The criticism points towards a perceived slowness in decision-making and implementation from key financial authorities. Blaming regulators alone is insufficient, according to Osborne, suggesting a broader systemic issue. Stablecoin Standoff: Despite the Treasury expressing support for stablecoins, concrete progress has been limited. The Bank of England, in particular, remains skeptical about allowing commercial banks to issue them, creating a bottleneck for a crucial segment of the crypto market. This situation creates a challenging environment for those looking to build and invest in the UK’s crypto sector. Without a robust and forward-thinking approach to UK crypto regulation , the nation risks losing out on the economic benefits and technological advancements that other jurisdictions are actively pursuing. The ‘Big Bang’ Analogy: A Call for Transformative UK Crypto Regulation Osborne’s comparison of the crypto sector’s potential to the ‘Big Bang’ reforms of the 1980s is significant. Those reforms deregulated London’s financial markets, leading to a massive expansion of the city’s global financial services industry. If crypto holds similar transformative power, then the current cautious stance on UK crypto regulation could be seen as a missed opportunity of historical proportions. Consider the parallels: Aspect 1980s ‘Big Bang’ Current Crypto Landscape Driving Force Technological advancements (e.g., electronic trading) and global competition Blockchain technology, decentralization, digital assets, tokenization Key Action Deregulation, abolition of fixed commissions, opening to foreign firms Need for clear legal frameworks, consumer protection, innovation support Potential Outcome (Positive) London’s rise as a global financial hub UK as a leader in Web3, fintech, and digital asset innovation Risk of Inaction Loss of competitiveness to other financial centers Talent drain, reduced investment, missed economic opportunities The core message is clear: if the UK wants to maintain its standing as a leading financial center, it must embrace the digital asset revolution with the same boldness it showed in the 1980s. Proactive UK crypto regulation is not just about managing risk; it’s about seizing opportunity. What are the Challenges for Effective UK Crypto Regulation? While the call for action is strong, implementing effective UK crypto regulation is not without its complexities. The very nature of decentralized finance presents unique challenges for traditional regulatory bodies. A symbolic representation of the challenges faced in crafting modern financial regulations for digital assets. UK Crypto Regulation: A Dire Warning as Britain Risks Falling Behind Some of the key hurdles include: Defining Digital Assets: Classifying various crypto assets (e.g., utility tokens, security tokens, stablecoins, NFTs) under existing legal frameworks is a complex task. Different classifications imply different regulatory treatments. Jurisdictional Arbitrage: The global, borderless nature of crypto means that overly restrictive regulations in one jurisdiction can simply push innovation and talent to more welcoming shores. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Regulators must strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation, protecting consumers from scams and market volatility, and preventing illicit financial activities. This requires deep understanding and agility. Technological Pace: The rapid evolution of blockchain technology and new crypto applications means that regulations can quickly become outdated. A flexible, principles-based approach may be more effective than rigid, prescriptive rules. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between government, regulators, and the industry itself. A ‘wait and see’ approach risks creating a regulatory vacuum that benefits no one. Actionable Insights: Paving the Way for Robust UK Crypto Regulation Osborne’s critique isn’t just about identifying problems; it’s a plea for proactive solutions. So, what steps can be taken to accelerate UK crypto regulation and ensure Britain remains competitive? Here are some actionable insights: Establish a Dedicated Task Force: Create a cross-governmental and cross-regulatory body with a clear mandate and timeline to develop and implement a comprehensive digital asset strategy. This task force should include industry experts. Prioritize Stablecoin Legislation: Given their potential to bridge traditional finance and the crypto world, clear and robust regulation for stablecoins should be fast-tracked. This includes defining issuer responsibilities, reserve requirements, and consumer protections. Adopt a Phased, Adaptive Approach: Instead of waiting for a perfect, all-encompassing framework, implement regulations in phases, starting with the most critical areas (e.g., stablecoins, custody, anti-money laundering). Build in mechanisms for regular review and adaptation. Learn from Global Leaders: Analyze approaches taken by jurisdictions like the U.S. (with its recent clarity on stablecoins and digital asset definitions) and the EU (with MiCA regulation) to identify best practices and potential pitfalls. Foster Dialogue with the Industry: Regular, open communication between policymakers, regulators, and crypto businesses is crucial to ensure regulations are practical, effective, and do not inadvertently stifle legitimate innovation. By taking these steps, the UK can signal its commitment to becoming a hub for digital asset innovation, attracting investment, fostering job creation, and securing its place in the future of finance. The time for hesitant observation is over; the time for decisive UK crypto regulation is now. Conclusion: Seizing the Moment for UK Crypto Regulation George Osborne’s warning serves as a powerful wake-up call for the United Kingdom. The digital asset revolution is not a distant future but a present reality, and nations that fail to adapt risk being left behind. The comparison to the ‘Big Bang’ underscores the magnitude of the opportunity and the peril of inaction. While challenges exist, the path forward involves clear legal frameworks, agile regulatory responses, and a collaborative spirit between government, regulators, and the burgeoning crypto industry. For Britain to truly capitalize on the potential of this new financial frontier, it must embrace a bold, proactive approach to UK crypto regulation , ensuring it remains at the forefront of global financial innovation rather than watching from the sidelines. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is George Osborne’s main concern regarding UK crypto regulation? George Osborne’s primary concern is that Britain is falling behind other major economies in establishing a clear and comprehensive legal framework for digital assets, particularly stablecoins, which could hinder innovation and economic growth in the crypto sector. What is the ‘Big Bang’ analogy in the context of crypto regulation? The ‘Big Bang’ refers to the significant deregulation of London’s financial markets in the 1980s, which propelled the city into a leading global financial center. Osborne uses this analogy to suggest that crypto has similar transformative potential, and the UK needs a similarly bold regulatory approach to seize it. Why is stablecoin regulation particularly important for the UK? Stablecoins are seen as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, offering stability due to their pegging to fiat currencies or other assets. Clear regulation for stablecoins is crucial for their broader adoption, institutional use, and for facilitating digital payments and financial innovation safely. Who are the key figures being criticized for the slow progress in UK crypto regulation? Former Chancellor George Osborne specifically criticized current Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey for their perceived slow action and cautious stance on crypto and stablecoin policy. What could be the consequences if the UK continues to lag in crypto regulation? If the UK continues to lag, it risks a talent drain, reduced investment in its digital asset sector, and missing out on the significant economic opportunities presented by blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. It could diminish London’s standing as a global financial innovation hub. If you found this insight into UK crypto regulation valuable, please share this article with your network on social media.

2025-08-04 06:32:07,49508353,1754289127,Expert Analysts Share Their Predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices in August,"The cryptocurrency market has been on the rise in the last two months, driven by institutional investments that overshadowed macroeconomic indicators. However, analysts warn that this momentum could reverse in August. New tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, ranging from 10% to 41%, combined with weak employment data, have intensified selling pressure on both traditional and crypto assets. In July, Ethereum (ETH) attracted attention with an impressive 49% surge, while Bitcoin (BTC) surged 8%, reaching a new all-time high mid-month. This rise was fueled by strong investment flows into ETFs. While Bitcoin ETFs continue to see steady inflows, interest in Ethereum-focused funds has surged. The influence of a new generation of treasury companies aiming to accumulate crypto assets has also been notable. However, analysts are expecting a pullback in the crypto market for August, particularly following the widespread sell-off in stocks and the bond rally. “Bitcoin is caught between ETF-fueled optimism and global trade tensions,” said NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef. “Unless a new macro catalyst emerges, it could trade within a narrow price range,” Youssef said, noting that price volatility is expected to be low in August, but investor positions will remain active. Pauline Shangett, ChangeNOW's Director of Strategy, shared a similar view: “I expect Bitcoin to trade within a narrow range in the near term. Ethereum, however, may be more resilient thanks to ETF demand and interest from large investors.” More than $5 billion in inflows into Ethereum ETFs in July brought the total inflow to $9.64 billion. Around $6 billion in new investments were also made into Bitcoin ETFs during the same period. “We're turning this consolidation period into an opportunity,” said Wolfe Research technical analyst Read Harvey. “We expect new momentum and a breakout in the coming weeks.” Harvey argued that pullbacks present buying opportunities and that crypto assets will continue to outperform stocks. Related News: Watch Out: There are a Lot of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up Next Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List According to Ray Youssef, Bitcoin could trade between $114,000 and $120,000 in August, with buying support likely at $103,000-$109,000. For Ethereum, a push to $4,000 is possible as long as it stays above $3,750. However, the $3,200 to $2,900 area remains a strong support area. According to experts, the biggest uncertainty for crypto markets lies in the Fed meeting in September. “Jerome Powell's statements often trigger sudden and sharp price movements,” Youssef said, noting that market sentiment could shift rapidly if geopolitical tensions escalate. However, unless macroeconomic conditions deteriorate dramatically, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to continue gaining momentum below the surface. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-04 06:30:51,49508350,1754289051,U.S. Debt Will Push Bitcoin to New Highs – And This Altcoin Will Follow,"Bitcoin might be moving sideways now, but the foundations for its next surge could already be in place. While market activity remains slow through the summer months, early investors are already scouting for undervalued opportunities—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly appearing on their radar. The altcoin has been gaining traction as a potential high-ROI investment, just as macro forces begin to favor crypto’s long-term upside . U.S. Debt Adds Fuel to Bitcoin’s Bullish Outlook Matrixport’s latest market outlook argues that Bitcoin’s breakout may arrive sooner than expected—not because of short-term speculation, but due to powerful fiscal trends emerging in the U.S. Government debt continues to spiral upward, with President Donald Trump’s latest proposal to expand the debt ceiling by $5 trillion pushing Treasury obligations into new territory. This sharp rise in borrowing highlights growing concern over long-term monetary risk. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature have always made it attractive in times of economic uncertainty, but this environment may make it essential. Meanwhile, capital keeps flowing into digital assets, particularly Ethereum ETFs and staking platforms, hinting at rising institutional conviction even while retail sentiment stays cautious. The Altcoin That is Positioned as a High-ROI Opportunity Amid the broader market’s consolidation, analysts now spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as a 36x opportunity for forward-thinking investors. The project has seen consistent engagement growth, and its limited supply model paired with ongoing ecosystem development is drawing comparisons to the early phases of top-performing altcoins. Even a small $1,000 allocation could grow into $36,000 , according to current trajectory estimates. With whales and early adopters moving in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most-watched altcoins in the space. More Than Just a Market Pause Though derivatives activity and funding rates suggest a neutral stance from short-term traders, Matrixport believes long-term positioning is steadily shifting in Bitcoin’s favor. The macro environment—driven by expanding debt, inflation fears, and delayed Federal Reserve decisions—is primed for a renewed move into hard assets. If fiscal risks continue to grow, Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge could accelerate, bringing other promising assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE along for the ride. The stage is quietly being set for a much larger crypto resurgence—one driven not by hype, but by structural economic shifts. Conclusion Bitcoin may seem dormant now, but the pressure is building beneath the surface. As the U.S. debt burden expands and institutional money continues flowing into crypto, a major uptrend could emerge in the months ahead. And for investors with an eye on altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 36x potential makes it a compelling choice to ride the next wave of growth.

2025-08-04 06:25:11,49508052,1754288711,Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group’s Bold $2.2M Raise Fuels Crypto Confidence,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group’s Bold $2.2M Raise Fuels Crypto Confidence In a move that underscores the growing confidence in digital assets among traditional businesses, Swedish health-tech firm H100 Group has made headlines with a significant funding round aimed squarely at expanding its cryptocurrency holdings. The company announced it has successfully raised 21.2 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to a substantial $2.2 million, specifically earmarked for further Bitcoin acquisition. This development, initially shared via an X post by @btcNLNico, highlights a fascinating trend: established companies are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies, recognizing its potential as a robust asset. Understanding H100 Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition H100 Group, primarily known for its innovative work in the health-tech sector, might seem like an unconventional player in the Bitcoin space. However, their latest fundraising effort signals a clear, deliberate strategy to bolster their balance sheet with digital assets. As of July 31, the company already held an impressive 685.1 BTC. This new capital infusion is set to significantly increase that figure, positioning H100 Group as a notable corporate holder of Bitcoin. So, why would a health-tech company venture so deeply into the world of Bitcoin acquisition? The reasons are multifaceted and reflect a broader shift in corporate financial planning: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a strong hedge against inflation, especially in an era of quantitative easing and rising global economic uncertainties. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Diversification of Assets: Adding Bitcoin provides a non-correlated asset to a company’s portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk and enhancing returns. It offers a different risk-reward profile compared to conventional investments. Long-Term Value Store: Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold. Companies are looking beyond short-term fluctuations and focusing on its long-term appreciation potential. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking move, aligning a company with the rapidly evolving digital economy. It demonstrates an understanding of future financial landscapes. This strategic move by H100 Group is not an isolated incident. It mirrors a growing trend among publicly traded and private companies globally to allocate portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. This institutional interest is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s maturing status as a legitimate financial asset. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition The decision by H100 Group to actively pursue further Bitcoin acquisition places them among a growing cohort of companies that have embraced the leading cryptocurrency. This trend gained significant momentum during the last few years, with several high-profile companies making substantial Bitcoin investments. Here’s a brief look at some of the pioneering entities and the rationale behind their decisions: Company Primary Motivation for Bitcoin Acquisition MicroStrategy Primary treasury reserve asset, inflation hedge, long-term value store. Tesla Balance sheet diversification, innovation, potential payment method. Block (formerly Square) Strategic investment, support for the crypto ecosystem, financial inclusion. Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin mining company, holding mined Bitcoin as a core strategy. These examples illustrate that the motivations for corporate Bitcoin acquisition are diverse, ranging from treasury management and inflation hedging to strategic alignment with the future of finance. H100 Group’s move reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset for individual investors but a serious consideration for corporate balance sheets. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for the Market? Every instance of significant corporate Bitcoin acquisition sends ripples through the broader cryptocurrency market. Here’s how H100 Group’s latest funding round could impact the ecosystem: Increased Institutional Confidence: When traditional companies, especially those outside the direct crypto industry like H100 Group, publicly commit to Bitcoin, it signals a growing mainstream acceptance. This can attract more institutional investors and even other corporations to explore similar strategies. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As more Bitcoin is moved from exchanges into corporate treasuries, the available supply for trading decreases. This can create upward price pressure, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Market Stability: Corporate holders tend to be long-term investors, often referred to as ‘HODLers’ (Hold On for Dear Life). Their accumulation of Bitcoin can contribute to greater market stability by reducing selling pressure during market downturns. Regulatory Scrutiny and Clarity: The increasing involvement of corporations in Bitcoin acquisition may also prompt regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, which could ultimately benefit the entire crypto industry by fostering a more predictable environment. While the $2.2 million raised by H100 Group might seem modest compared to the multi-billion dollar acquisitions by giants like MicroStrategy, each new corporate entry adds to the cumulative institutional demand, gradually solidifying Bitcoin’s position in the global financial landscape. Challenges and Considerations in Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition Despite the evident benefits, corporate Bitcoin acquisition is not without its challenges. Companies embarking on this path must navigate several complexities: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet. Managing this volatility requires a robust risk management strategy. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Companies must stay abreast of changing laws and ensure compliance. Custody and Security: Safely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise in digital asset custody. Companies must implement stringent security measures to protect their holdings from hacks or loss. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for Bitcoin on a company’s balance sheet can be complex due to its classification as an intangible asset and the need to mark it to market value. H100 Group, like other corporate Bitcoin holders, will need to carefully manage these aspects to ensure their investment strategy remains sound and sustainable. Their continued commitment despite these challenges speaks volumes about their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: An Actionable Insight H100 Group’s successful fundraise for further Bitcoin acquisition serves as a compelling case study for other businesses considering a similar path. It highlights that the appetite for digital assets extends beyond the traditional finance and tech sectors, reaching into diverse industries like health-tech. For investors, this trend suggests a deepening institutional layer supporting Bitcoin’s price and adoption. What actionable insights can we glean from this development? Firstly, corporate adoption is a powerful indicator of Bitcoin’s maturation. It signifies a shift from purely speculative interest to strategic financial planning. Secondly, it underscores the importance of understanding a company’s treasury strategy. Companies that actively manage their balance sheets with innovative assets like Bitcoin may be better positioned for future economic shifts. In conclusion, H100 Group’s $2.2 million raise for more Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving perception of digital assets in the corporate world. It signals a future where Bitcoin is not just a niche investment but a mainstream component of sophisticated financial strategies, driving confidence and innovation across various industries. A company’s decision to invest in Bitcoin reflects a forward-thinking approach to treasury management.

2025-08-04 06:15:10,49507613,1754288110,SYRUP Circulating Supply: Upbit’s Crucial Update Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld SYRUP Circulating Supply: Upbit’s Crucial Update Unveiled In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about tokenomics is paramount. Recently, a significant announcement from Upbit, a leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, caught the attention of many investors, particularly those interested in Maple Finance (SYRUP). Upbit officially communicated that it has updated the SYRUP circulating supply schedule. This adjustment, made at the specific request of the Maple Finance project team, is more than just a procedural change; it signals potential shifts that every SYRUP holder and prospective investor should understand. Understanding the SYRUP Circulating Supply Announcement When an exchange like Upbit announces an update to a token’s circulating supply schedule, it refers to changes in how and when tokens become available in the open market. The circulating supply is a key metric, representing the number of tokens currently accessible to the public and actively traded. It is distinct from the total supply or maximum supply, which include tokens not yet released or those permanently out of circulation. For Maple Finance’s SYRUP token, this update means the planned release of tokens into circulation has been altered. This could involve: Adjusted Vesting Schedules: Changes to how quickly team members, advisors, or early investors receive their allocated tokens. Strategic Reserves: Reallocations from project reserves for new initiatives, partnerships, or ecosystem development. Token Burns: Although less common for schedule adjustments, a burn would permanently remove tokens from the total and circulating supply, impacting scarcity. Liquidity Pool Adjustments: Changes related to tokens provided for liquidity on decentralized exchanges. The crucial detail here is that the adjustment was made at the Maple Finance project team’s request. This suggests a strategic decision by the project itself, rather than an arbitrary move by the exchange. Such requests are often driven by evolving project roadmaps, market conditions, or new strategic directions that necessitate a revised token release plan to better align with long-term goals. Why the SYRUP Circulating Supply Update Matters for Investors The circulating supply of a cryptocurrency directly influences its market dynamics, particularly its price. Here’s why the SYRUP circulating supply update is important for investors: Impact on Scarcity and Price: If the update implies a slower release of tokens, it could lead to increased scarcity in the short term, potentially supporting price. Conversely, an accelerated release could increase selling pressure. Transparency and Trust: Clear communication about supply schedule changes enhances transparency. Projects that openly communicate such adjustments build greater trust within their community and among investors. Market Capitalization Calculation: Market capitalization (circulating supply x price) is a widely used metric for valuing a cryptocurrency. Any change in circulating supply directly impacts this figure, affecting how the asset is perceived relative to others. Investment Strategy Adjustment: Investors need to reassess their investment thesis. A change in supply schedule might alter the risk-reward profile of holding SYRUP, requiring adjustments to entry or exit strategies. Understanding these implications is vital for making informed decisions. While the immediate impact might not always be drastic, the long-term effects on token distribution and market sentiment can be significant. Aspect of Supply Potential Change Likely Market Impact Vesting Schedule Extended release period for team tokens Reduced selling pressure, increased scarcity Strategic Allocations New tokens for partnerships or ecosystem grants Increased utility, but potentially more tokens in circulation Liquidity Incentives Adjusted rewards for liquidity providers Influences trading volume and depth Token Burn Events Permanent removal of tokens from supply Direct increase in token scarcity, often positive price impact Navigating Tokenomics: Actionable Insights for SYRUP Holders For those holding SYRUP or considering an investment, the Upbit announcement on SYRUP circulating supply should prompt a deeper dive into the token’s fundamentals. Here are some actionable insights: Consult Official Sources: Always refer to Maple Finance’s official website, blog, or whitepaper for the specific details of the updated schedule. Upbit’s announcement serves as a notification, but the project team provides the granular information. Understand the ‘Why’: Investigate the reasons behind the project team’s request for the change. Is it to support new product launches, enhance decentralization, or react to market conditions? The rationale often reveals the project’s strategic direction. Re-evaluate Your Position: Consider how the updated supply schedule aligns with your personal investment goals and risk tolerance. Does it strengthen your conviction in the project’s long-term viability, or does it introduce new concerns? Monitor Market Reaction: Observe how the market reacts to the news. While initial reactions can be speculative, sustained price movements or changes in trading volume can indicate broader sentiment. Stay Updated on Maple Finance Developments: Token supply changes are often part of a larger strategic plan. Keep abreast of Maple Finance’s overall development, partnerships, and community engagement to understand the full context. Being proactive in your research and analysis will help you make more informed decisions in response to such updates. What Does This SYRUP Circulating Supply Change Mean for Maple Finance? The request from Maple Finance to adjust its SYRUP circulating supply schedule highlights the project’s active management of its tokenomics. Maple Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on institutional lending. For such a project, precise control over token distribution is vital for several reasons: Long-Term Stability: A well-managed token supply schedule can contribute to the long-term stability and health of the ecosystem by preventing excessive inflation or sudden token dumps. Alignment with Milestones: Projects often tie token releases to specific development milestones or business achievements. Adjusting the schedule ensures that token distribution remains aligned with the project’s progress and value creation. Attracting Institutional Adoption: For a protocol targeting institutional clients, predictability and sound tokenomics are critical. Any adjustment could be aimed at making SYRUP more attractive to large-scale investors who prioritize stable and transparent token distribution models. Ecosystem Growth: New initiatives, such as grants for developers, liquidity incentives, or community-driven programs, often require specific token allocations that might necessitate a revised schedule. Ultimately, this change reflects Maple Finance’s ongoing efforts to optimize its tokenomics for its evolving strategy and market position. It underscores the importance of flexible yet transparent token management in the fast-paced DeFi landscape. The announcement from Upbit regarding the updated SYRUP circulating supply schedule for Maple Finance is a significant development for the token’s ecosystem. While the specifics of the changes require a deeper dive into Maple Finance’s official communications, the event itself serves as a reminder of the critical role tokenomics play in a cryptocurrency’s value proposition. Investors must remain vigilant, leveraging official announcements from exchanges like Upbit and direct information from project teams to stay ahead. By understanding the ‘why’ behind such changes and their potential implications, you can better navigate the complexities of the crypto market and make more robust investment decisions for your portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is SYRUP circulating supply? The SYRUP circulating supply refers to the number of Maple Finance (SYRUP) tokens that are currently available to the public and actively traded in the market. It is a key metric used to calculate the token’s market capitalization. Why did Upbit update the SYRUP circulating supply schedule? Upbit updated the schedule at the direct request of the Maple Finance project team. Such requests are typically made to align token releases with strategic project developments, market conditions, or new ecosystem initiatives. How does a change in circulating supply affect a token’s price? A change in circulating supply can impact a token’s price by altering its scarcity. If fewer tokens are released, scarcity increases, potentially supporting the price. If more tokens are released, it could lead to increased selling pressure. Where can I find the detailed updated SYRUP circulating supply schedule? For the most detailed and specific information regarding the updated SYRUP circulating supply schedule, investors should refer to the official announcements and documentation provided by the Maple Finance project team on their official website or communication channels. Is this update a positive or negative development for SYRUP holders? The impact depends on the specifics of the update. A slower release schedule might be seen as positive due to increased scarcity, while an accelerated release could be viewed negatively. It’s crucial to understand the rationale behind the change and its alignment with Maple Finance’s long-term vision to assess its overall impact. What is Maple Finance? Maple Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that provides institutional-grade capital markets infrastructure. It enables uncollateralized lending for institutions and offers yield opportunities for lenders in the crypto space. Did you find this article insightful?

2025-08-04 06:10:10,49507439,1754287810,Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment for Traders,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment for Traders In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, understanding market sentiment is paramount. While price charts tell one story, the underlying sentiment of traders often paints a more complete picture. This is where the Bitcoin long short ratio comes into play, offering a vital glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves in the market. For anyone involved in BTC perpetual futures, grasping this ratio is not just helpful; it’s absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. It helps you see beyond the immediate price action and understand the collective bullish or bearish bias of the market participants. What Exactly Are BTC Perpetual Futures? Before diving deep into the Bitcoin long short ratio , it’s essential to understand the instrument itself: BTC perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed expiry date, perpetual futures do not. This unique feature makes them highly popular among cryptocurrency traders because they can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. They are designed to mimic the spot price of Bitcoin, using a mechanism called ‘funding rates’ to keep the perpetual contract price closely tied to the underlying asset’s spot price. This continuous nature allows for constant speculation on Bitcoin’s future price movements, making the aggregated data from these contracts a powerful indicator of market mood. Decoding the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: What Does it Tell Us? The Bitcoin long short ratio is a metric that compares the number of long positions (bets that the price will go up) to the number of short positions (bets that the price will go down) on a particular exchange or across the entire market. It’s typically calculated as the total volume or number of long positions divided by the total volume or number of short positions. A ratio above 1 generally indicates a dominance of long positions, suggesting a bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 points to more short positions, signaling a bearish outlook. This ratio acts as a real-time pulse of trader confidence, showing whether the majority of participants anticipate an upward or downward price movement. It’s a direct reflection of collective market positioning. The Latest Snapshot: BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios (Past 24 Hours) Let’s take a look at the most recent 24-hour data for Bitcoin long short ratio across several major cryptocurrency exchanges. This snapshot provides immediate insight into the prevailing sentiment. Observing these figures can help traders gauge the overall market mood and identify potential divergences or convergences in trader expectations. Category Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Market 49.35% 50.65% As the aggregate data suggests, the overall market currently shows a slight lean towards short positions. With 50.65% of positions being short against 49.35% long, there’s a marginal bearish bias across the board. This indicates that slightly more traders, by volume, are betting on a decline in Bitcoin’s price over the short term. However, the ratio is very close to equilibrium, suggesting a highly contested market without a strong directional conviction from the majority. A Closer Look: Exchange-Specific Bitcoin Long Short Ratio Dynamics While the total market ratio gives a general idea, examining individual exchanges can reveal interesting nuances in the Bitcoin long short ratio . Different exchanges cater to different types of traders, which can lead to varying sentiment profiles. Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Binance 47.96% 52.04% Bybit 50.25% 49.75% Gate.io 52.39% 47.61% Data shows a slight overall short bias in BTC perpetual futures, with variations across exchanges. Bitcoin Long Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment for Traders Binance: This exchange shows a more pronounced bearish sentiment compared to the overall market, with 52.04% short positions. Given Binance’s large user base, which includes a significant number of retail traders, this could suggest that a substantial portion of the retail segment is anticipating a downward move. This often reflects a quick reaction to recent price dips or general market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Bybit: Bybit presents a nearly balanced picture, with a very slight lean towards long positions at 50.25%. This indicates a more neutral or indecisive sentiment among its user base, suggesting that traders on Bybit are either split on future price direction or are waiting for clearer signals before committing heavily to one side. Such equilibrium can sometimes precede significant moves once a clear catalyst emerges. Gate.io: In contrast to Binance, Gate.io exhibits the strongest bullish sentiment among the top three, with 52.39% long positions. This suggests that traders on Gate.io are more optimistic about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Differences like these highlight that market sentiment isn’t monolithic; it can vary significantly across different trading platforms due to diverse user demographics, trading styles, and liquidity pools. Why is the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio a Vital Indicator for Traders? Understanding the Bitcoin long short ratio offers several strategic advantages for traders. Firstly, it serves as a powerful sentiment gauge. If the ratio is heavily skewed one way, it signals strong conviction among traders. Secondly, it can act as a contrarian indicator. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, it might suggest that the market is over-leveraged on the bullish side, potentially setting up for a short squeeze or a liquidation cascade if the price moves unexpectedly against the majority. Conversely, a heavily short-skewed ratio could indicate an oversold market ripe for a bounce. Lastly, it can be a confirmation tool, validating your own analysis if your directional bias aligns with the majority or divergence if it doesn’t, prompting further investigation. Factors Influencing Bitcoin Long Short Ratio Shifts The Bitcoin long short ratio is dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Primary among these are significant price movements; a sharp drop might trigger more short positions, while a strong rally could encourage longs. News events, whether positive (e.g., institutional adoption, regulatory clarity) or negative (e.g., exchange hacks, regulatory crackdowns), can swiftly shift sentiment. Funding rates on perpetual futures also play a role; high positive funding rates incentivize shorting (as shorts get paid), while negative rates incentivize longing. Macroeconomic data, such as inflation reports or interest rate decisions, can indirectly impact crypto markets and, consequently, trader positioning. Finally, large whale movements or sudden changes in open interest can also signal shifts in major players’ strategies, influencing the overall ratio. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges in Interpreting Bitcoin Long Short Ratio Data While invaluable, the Bitcoin long short ratio is not a standalone crystal ball. One challenge is its inherent volatility; the ratio can change rapidly, reflecting the fast-paced nature of crypto markets. Secondly, it doesn’t account for the size of individual positions; a few large ‘whale’ trades can disproportionately influence the ratio compared to many smaller retail trades. Moreover, it’s a lagging or concurrent indicator, meaning it reflects current sentiment rather than predicting future price action with certainty. Traders must also be aware of potential manipulation or ‘fakeouts,’ where large players might intentionally skew the ratio to induce certain market reactions. Therefore, it should always be used in conjunction with other analytical tools. Actionable Strategies: Leveraging the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio in Your Trading So, how can you effectively use the Bitcoin long short ratio in your trading strategy? Firstly, combine it with technical analysis. Look for divergences: if the price is making new highs but the ratio shows increasing shorts, it might signal weakness. Conversely, if price is dropping but longs are increasing, it could suggest a potential reversal. Secondly, pay attention to extreme readings. An exceptionally high long ratio could be a warning sign of an overbought market, potentially due to over-leveraged positions. Similarly, an extremely low long ratio (high short ratio) might indicate an oversold market. Finally, consider the funding rates alongside the ratio. High positive funding rates combined with a high long ratio might signal an impending correction, as longs are paying shorts heavily, making shorting more attractive. Conclusion: Mastering Market Sentiment with the Bitcoin Long Short Ratio The Bitcoin long short ratio is a powerful tool for discerning market sentiment in the volatile world of BTC perpetual futures. By understanding how traders are collectively positioning themselves, you gain an edge in anticipating potential price movements and managing your risk more effectively. While no single indicator guarantees success, integrating the long-short ratio with a comprehensive analysis of technical indicators, fundamental news, and overall market structure can significantly enhance your trading decisions. Always remember that the crypto market is dynamic, and continuous learning and adaptation are key to navigating its complexities. Empower yourself with data, but always trade responsibly and with a well-defined strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing positions to be held indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. They use a funding rate mechanism to keep their price anchored to Bitcoin’s spot price. How is the Bitcoin long short ratio calculated? The Bitcoin long short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total volume or number of long positions by the total volume or number of short positions on a specific exchange or across multiple exchanges. For example, if there are 60% long positions and 40% short positions, the ratio would be 1.5 (60/40). What does a high or low Bitcoin long short ratio indicate? A high Bitcoin long short ratio (e.g., above 1.0) indicates that there are more long positions than short positions, suggesting a generally bullish sentiment among traders. Conversely, a low ratio (e.g., below 1.0) signifies more short positions, pointing to a prevailing bearish sentiment. Extreme ratios can sometimes signal market tops or bottoms. Is the Bitcoin long short ratio a reliable indicator for trading? The Bitcoin long short ratio is a valuable sentiment indicator but should not be used in isolation. While it provides insight into trader positioning, it can be volatile and influenced by large players. For reliable trading decisions, it’s best combined with other analytical tools like technical analysis, open interest data, funding rates, and fundamental market news. Why do Bitcoin long short ratios differ across exchanges? Ratios can differ across exchanges due to variations in their user demographics, trading volumes, liquidity, and the specific algorithms they use to calculate the ratio. Some exchanges might have a higher proportion of retail traders, while others attract more institutional or professional traders, leading to different collective sentiments on each platform. How can I use the Bitcoin long short ratio in my trading strategy? You can use the Bitcoin long short ratio as a sentiment confirmation tool or a contrarian indicator. If your analysis aligns with the ratio, it confirms your bias. If the ratio is at an extreme (e.g., overwhelmingly long or short) and diverges from price action, it might signal an impending reversal. Always use it as part of a broader strategy, not as the sole decision-making factor. Did you find this analysis of the Bitcoin long short ratio insightful?

2025-08-04 06:06:23,49507284,1754287583,XRP Market Cap Multiplier Tool. Here’s How It Works,"In a recent post on X, Phil Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, showcased a tool he designed to model XRP’s market cap multiplier effect. Kwok shared a video displaying various buy order sizes and their potential impact on XRP’s market cap, offering an analytical perspective on how limited order book liquidity can significantly amplify price movements. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier The tool presented by Kwok simulates how capital inflows of different magnitudes can result in exponential increases in XRP’s market cap. This happens due to the market cap multiplier effect , which refers to the phenomenon where a relatively small amount of capital inflow causes a disproportionately large increase in market capitalization. This effect arises because buy orders consume available liquidity on the order book, forcing the price higher as orders are filled at increasing levels, and significantly expanding the total market cap with modest inflows. her: “he’s probably out partying with other girls”. me on friday night: making $XRP market cap multiplier visualisations. (i’ve also open sourced this all so you can use it to visualise how multipliers work) pic.twitter.com/LT0zZKWnpN — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) August 1, 2025 Potential Impact on XRP’s Price When Kwok made the video, XRP was trading at $2.97, with a circulating supply of 59.3 billion tokens. Based on these figures, its market capitalization stands at approximately $176.1 billion. A relatively modest $10 million buy order could increase XRP’s market cap by $1.78 billion, putting the market cap at $177.9 billion with a multiplier of 178x. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A larger $150 million buy order results in a multiplier effect of 803x, pushing the market cap up by $120.4 billion to $296.5 billion. This scenario would also send XRP to $5 , marking a new all-time high for the digital asset. Scaling the Effect with Larger Inflows As the buy order size increases, the price of XRP rises accordingly. A $600 million buy order elevates XRP’s price to $15 and expands the market cap by $713.4 billion, resulting in a total market cap of $889.5 billion, a 1189x multiplier. A $1 billion buy order raises the price to $20 and pushes the market cap to $1.27 trillion, a 980x increase. Larger inflows create more dramatic results. At $5 billion, the tool predicts XRP’s market cap could exceed $3.6 trillion, with a 671x multiplier and each token priced at $60. At this level, XRP will flip Bitcoin and become the largest cryptocurrency in the market. The most extreme scenario displayed is a $10 billion buy order, which would drive the price to $90 and the market cap to over $5.3 trillion, a 516x increase. These calculations emphasize the outsized impact of liquidity constraints on digital asset valuations. Kwok noted that he has made the tool open source, allowing others to replicate and explore similar multiplier scenarios using real-time market data.

2025-08-04 06:00:59,49507074,1754287259,When Will The Bitcoin Correction End? The Support Level That Holds The Key,"After crashing below the $115,000 territory over the weekend, Bitcoin has reached an important level that could determine where the crypto market is headed next. Eventually, it comes down to the support levels and how much buying is going on to actually counter the effects of massive sell-offs that continue to drive down the price. However, if bulls are able to hold, then it could suggest there is enough momentum behind the cryptocurrency to push for new highs. Why Bitcoin Must Hold $100,000 In an analysis, crypto and market analyst MasterAnanda has pointed to the Bitcoin price already solidifying support that could help end the downtrend. Pointing to the current market decline, the analyst explains that the price is actually only down 8% after hitting its $123,000 all-time high back on July 14. This retrace is nothing out of the ordinary, which MasterAnanda refers to as “part of the normal workings of the market.” Related Reading: Satoshimeter Shows Where Bitcoin Price Is In This Cycle The current Bitcoin price fluctuations have not raised any alarms, as corrections are expected and are needed for the price to continue to rally. As the analyst explains, such fluctuations usually see the cryptocurrency reach new higher highs over the longer timeframe. Already, there is a lot of support for the Bitcoin price above the $110,000 level. This shows that while bears are pushing down hard, buying is still soaking up the dumped supply in the market. The analyst points to this support level as important, but highlights an even more important and stronger support level lying just above $100,000. This $100,000 level has remained a psychological level since it was first hit back in December 2024, becoming the level to hold if the market were to continue its uptrend. The crypto analyst explains that as long as the Bitcoin price remains above $100,000, then the bulls will continue to be in control. Related Reading: Market Cap Not A Hindrance To XRP Price Reaching $1,000, Expert Explains Why “After a few weeks, or several months, exactly as it happened last time, Bitcoin will go up. So you can expect retraces and corrections, but this is only short-term long-term we grow,” Master Ananda stated. However, there is still the possibility that the price does fall below the $100,000 level. In this case, it would mean an invalidation of the bullish thesis, and the analyst revealed that the short and mid-term analysis would need to be revisited and updated if this happens.

2025-08-04 06:00:53,49507252,1754287253,"BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction, $0.0016 Entry, and $360M Raised: A Calculated Opportunity Amid BNB’s Highs and AVAX’s Resilience!","August has delivered significant movement in the crypto market, with Binance Coin (BNB) surging to $855 after a massive $520 million buy-in, pushing trading volume to new heights. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) is showing resilience with a steady price pattern, hinting at a potential rebound after testing key support. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with a unique high-engagement strategy. Tied to its GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, the project offers a 10 BTC Auction linked to every BDAG purchase. With a $0.0016 entry still available, BlockDAG blends timing, participation, and structure in a way that other projects aren’t currently doing. BNB Price Surge Driven by Institutional Demand Binance Coin (BNB) saw an explosive price surge in late July, reaching an all-time high near $855. This rally was sparked by a $520 million treasury purchase by Windtree Therapeutics, which triggered a surge in institutional buying and trading volume. Over 24 hours, BNB’s trading volume jumped nearly 195%, surpassing $2.9 billion, and the price broke through key resistance after a clean retest around $780. From a technical standpoint, BNB is in a discovery phase, with price patterns showing potential for continued upside. While retracements near support levels are possible, the overall strength reflects growing confidence from both traders and institutional investors. Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Potential for Rebound Avalanche (AVAX) is currently testing key support levels after a dip to $25, following rejection at the $27 resistance. This pullback is seen as healthy consolidation, with the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) providing a reliable support floor. The bullish crossover between the 20-day EMA and 50-day simple moving average (SMA) supports the continuation of the broader upward trend. Technical patterns, including a long-term descending channel and double bottom formation, suggest that AVAX is on track for a potential rebound. A breakout above $26 or $27 could unlock targets between $31 and $35, depending on liquidity and volume. On-chain data confirms demand near support, but traders should watch for risk zones around the $28 liquidity cluster, which could trigger shakeouts. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction: The Final Push Before August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH BlockDAG’s presale is entering a critical phase, with a 10 BTC Auction designed to ramp up participation ahead of its August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This isn’t your typical giveaway. BlockDAG’s auction rewards users based on their BDAG purchases. The more tokens buyers acquire before the deadline, the larger their share of the $1.1 million Bitcoin prize pool. This reward structure is proportional, making it a clear incentive for high-volume buyers. With the presale now in batch 29, BlockDAG has already raised $360 million and sold over 24.7 billion BDAG. The current batch price of $0.0276 represents an impressive 2,660% ROI since batch 1. For latecomers, there’s still an opportunity to secure BDAG tokens at the limited-time price of $0.0016, giving them a chance to maximize their ROI and enter the auction. BlockDAG’s approach is about more than just buying tokens; it’s about becoming part of a system that incentivizes early action and community involvement. The presale offers a rare opportunity for buyers to engage in a campaign that values long-term commitment. As the countdown to the August 11 launch begins, the 10 BTC Auction stands as the final incentive for buyers. With timing, scale, and rewards aligned, BlockDAG is closing its presale with a well-calculated push toward broad participation and lasting impact. Quick Rundown August has seen significant movement in the crypto space, with Binance Coin (BNB) surging on renewed institutional confidence and Avalanche (AVAX) showing signs of a possible rebound. Yet, BlockDAG is taking a different approach, focusing on strategic participation rather than reacting to market events. With its 10 BTC Auction directly tied to user engagement and a rare $0.0016 entry still available, BlockDAG provides a structured opportunity backed by $360 million in presale funds. As the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaches, timing may be the most valuable advantage for late-stage participants.

2025-08-04 06:00:51,49507142,1754287251,"Cryptocurrency Market Is Crashing: This Altcoin Offers 14,700% Profit","The cryptocurrency market has taken a sharp hit, sliding 4% in just 24 hours amid rising global uncertainty. A fresh round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports sparked a wave of risk-off sentiment, dragging down equities, boosting the dollar, and accelerating selloffs in digital assets. Bitcoin, the market’s bellwether, sank to $114,322, triggering a cascade of liquidations that wiped out more than $150 million in leveraged positions. Even as top coins faltered, investor attention is quickly pivoting to emerging opportunities. One name quietly gaining steam is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts believe could outperform the broader market dramatically. As crypto volatility drives many traders to seek hidden gems, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted as a rare early-stage project with potential gains as high as 14,700% , based on recent market modeling and strategic accumulation patterns. Leverage and Liquidations Worsen Bitcoin’s Slide The selloff wasn’t entirely unexpected—traders had built up massive leveraged bets, particularly in Bitcoin futures. When BTC lost the $115K level, a wave of forced liquidations followed, rapidly filling the July CME gap and sending prices into freefall. Now, with Bitcoin struggling to reclaim $116K, bulls are watching nervously. A failure to bounce could send prices toward $104K, according to technical analysts. The Top Coin Positioned for a Potential 147x Move While panic spreads through the mainstream crypto names, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract growing attention from investors chasing asymmetric upside. What’s turning heads is the project’s explosive adoption curve, smart contract integrations in progress, and recent signals of accumulation by large holders. Unlike overhyped tokens that already peaked, this one still sits at the ground floor— $2,500 invested today could grow to over $367,500 , based on current ROI projections if key milestones are hit in the next 6 months. Its aggressive growth trajectory and rapidly closing access windows are prompting comparisons to the early breakouts of DOGE and SHIB—coins that turned small bets into generational wealth. Altcoins Plunge Amid Insider Moves and Derivatives Unwind The rest of the market didn’t fare much better. PENGU, once a darling of the memecoin crowd, tanked after large insider wallets sent tokens to exchanges. Meanwhile, hype around INJ’s ETF-related developments quickly turned to disappointment as the token reversed gains. SUI, another high-flyer, collapsed below its support zone as cascading liquidations took hold. Crypto’s tight coupling with equity markets only amplified the damage. With the Nasdaq down 0.9% on the day, Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 reached its highest point in two months—reminding investors that crypto remains a high-beta play, not a hedge, in today’s macro-driven landscape. What Comes Next? Eyes are now locked on the U.S. jobs report due Friday. A weak print could push the Fed closer to a rate-cut stance, which may offer relief to risk assets. But if Bitcoin fails to recover key levels, the downtrend could deepen into August. As traders search for shelter or new opportunities in the downturn, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about alternatives— a potentially life-changing bet for those who move early .

This makes it the largest crypto theft in history, Arkham stated, and the haul today would be worth a whopping $14.5 billion. “Neither LuBian nor the hacker has publicly acknowledged the hack,” the firm stated. BREAKING: ARKHAM UNCOVERS $3.5B HEIST – THE LARGEST EVER LuBian was a Chinese mining pool with facilities in China & Iran. Based on analysis of on-chain data, it appears that 127,426 BTC was stolen from LuBian in December 2020, worth $3.5 billion at the time and now worth… pic.twitter.com/PnIOKgMt0i — Arkham (@arkham) August 2, 2025 Bigger than Mt. Gox The breach went unreported for over four years despite draining nearly all of LuBian’s holdings. The mining pool , which was once top-ten globally with 6% of Bitcoin’s hash rate, mysteriously shut down in early 2021. The closure was previously attributed to regulatory pressure, but is now understood to be the result of this catastrophic hack. Arkham reported that the mining pool appears to have been first hacked in December 2020 for over 90% of its BTC. Later that month, around $6 million of additional BTC and USDT was stolen from a LuBian address active on the Bitcoin Omni layer. The miner rotated their remaining funds to recovery wallets at the end of December 2020. Arkham believes the theft was enabled by weak private key generation, vulnerable to brute-force attacks. LuBian made desperate attempts to recover the funds, sending over 1,500 small transactions with 1.4 BTC with messages pleading for the return of the funds, but the hacker never responded. LuBian preserved 11,886 BTC, currently worth $1.35 billion, which they still hold; however, the hacker also still holds the stolen BTC, with their last known movement being a wallet consolidation in July 2024. The massive heist makes the LuBian hacker the 13th largest Bitcoin holder on Arkham, ahead of the Mt. Gox hacker, it stated. Big Year For Crypto Hacks Cybersecurity firm Certik reported that around $153 million was lost, combining all the exploits and scams in July. Around $86.6 million was attributed to incidents involving exchanges, while $55.4 million was lost in incidents related to code vulnerabilities, it revealed. #CertiKStatsAlert Combining all the incidents in July we’ve confirmed ~$153M lost to exploits and scams. ~$86.6M is attributed to incidents involving exchanges.

2025-08-04 05:58:02,49508173,1754287082,Traders call MUTM the next 35x gem soon after its $0.06 listing price,"With its sophisticated design and revenue-driven tokenomics, MUTM is earning a reputation as the next serious contender for exponential gains. This momentum isn’t built on hype. It’s grounded in sustainable income generation and structured capital flows. At the core lies the mtToken staking system—an engine designed to reward users in a powerful way. Whenever users stake mtToken in smart contracts, they will receive MUTM rewards in return. MUTM token rewards are generated through the platform’s open-market buyback program, funded directly by protocol revenue. Moreover, mtTokens are not just idle reward tools—they represent the real-time value of the deposited assets and accumulate interest algorithmically. As the protocol attracts more borrowing and lending activity, the intrinsic value of mtTokens increases, making them both a yield-generating tool and a core building block of the system’s stability. Presale enters critical stage as platform catalysts take shape The buzz from analysts and traders isn’t without reason. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with each token priced at just $0.035. Already, over 14,800 investors have joined the campaign, securing more than $13.85 million in contributions. With 7% of the Phase 6 allocation already sold, pressure is building as buyers race to lock in before the next phase kicks off. Once Phase 7 begins, the price will jump to $0.040—a 15% increase. The final listing price will be $0.06, but many seasoned investors see that only as the beginning. While early interest is largely driven by tokenomics, the broader roadmap offers some of the most compelling reasons to expect serious price action. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing through a structured four-phase development cycle, each stage engineered to boost protocol utility and user engagement. The upcoming beta release will bring live lending and borrowing through both P2P and P2C models, offering users a flexible and capital-efficient DeFi experience. These lending mechanics are built to scale as the protocol integrates with Layer-2 networks, helping reduce gas fees and accelerate adoption. Another powerful addition is the upcoming decentralized stablecoin, which will be fully overcollateralized and minted only during loan issuance. This creates a strictly controlled supply, preventing inflation while anchoring the protocol’s lending economy with a reliable $1 peg. The stablecoin’s integration into lending pools and staking modules is expected to significantly expand Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s real-world utility and drive demand for both mtTokens and MUTM itself. Security and transparency are also a core part of the foundation. The platform has undergone a manual security review and smart contract analysis by CertiK, achieving a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. Alongside this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $50,000 bug bounty campaign to reward ethical hackers who help strengthen the ecosystem. To accelerate community growth, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is underway. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM, further incentivizing users to explore the project and contribute to its early traction. With over 12,000 Twitter followers and growing daily, social proof continues to build. Early ETH whales already tripled—now eyeing 35x Some of the most successful investors in crypto history are those who acted early and stayed disciplined. One whale reportedly entered Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 when tokens were priced at just $0.01. Today, their holdings have already increased 3.5x—even before the token is publicly listed. Once MUTM launches at $0.06 and climbs toward post-listing targets of $2.10 based on market cap projections and user growth expectations, that same early position could transform into a 35x gain. This is the core reason seasoned traders and portfolio managers are talking. Unlike many presales, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a full economic engine—staking rewards, smart lending, and a built-in stablecoin, all converging into one unified system. With fundamentals this strong, the $0.035 entry point starts to look like an absolute bargain. There is still time to act. But once Phase 7 begins, the price jumps by 15%. The structured tokenomics, real protocol revenue, and sustainable yield generation set the stage for one of the most rewarding DeFi opportunities this cycle.

The Hidden Catalyst That Could Reverse Bitcoin’s Slide Actionable Market Insights Why this report matters Bitcoin just broke below $112,000, but the story behind the move runs deeper than most traders realize. A stealth trigger, missed by many, may soon shift the macro… pic.twitter.com/rVwtrn29OL — 10x Research (@10x_Research) August 3, 2025 The research noted that the catalyst is often overlooked and has the potential to reverse Bitcoin’s decline. “Key technical levels are converging with overlooked macro dynamics, offering a potential setup for those who know where to look.” BTC Major Rebound Mirrors Last Year’s Dynamics: Report The month of August has historically been the weakest month, with 5–20% drops. The report compares the current setup to that of last year’s dynamics. “Bitcoin has now corrected in line with typical August seasonality, coinciding with downward revisions to U.S. labor market data,” it noted, adding that the economy may be on shakier ground than investors had assumed. Last year, Bitcoin’s weakness proved temporary after the Fed responded to early signs of cooling labor market. The Fed softened with a surprise 50 basis point rate cut in September 2024, showing a long-term supportive backdrop for the BTC price . This momentum provided another near-term tailwind for Bitcoin. As reported earlier, the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%-4.5% last week, triggering a market selloff. 10x Research noted that we would expect further declines in risk assets after the first rate cut in September. This will be followed by a sharp rebound once a cut becomes certain and is publicly validated by Fed officials, it added. “In recent times, Bitcoin has proven its ability to weather turbulence inflicted by external factors, an encouraging sign of its increasing maturity,” Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank, told Cryptonews. “Our conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential still stands, undeterred by short-term price fluctuations.” The post A Stealth Trigger Might Reverse BTC Shaky Markets: 10x Research appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Market,EN,1,recent downward trend bitcoin breaking research say stealth trigger quietly building pressure background could lead btc explosive recovery market focus labor data rate cut another force quietly building pressure background wrote x monday hidden catalyst could reverse bitcoin slide actionable market insight report matter bitcoin broke story behind move run deeper trader realize stealth trigger missed many may soon shift research august research noted catalyst often overlooked potential reverse bitcoin decline key technical level converging overlooked macro dynamic offering potential setup know btc major rebound mirror last year dynamic report month august historically weakest month drop report compare current setup last year dynamic bitcoin corrected line typical august seasonality coinciding downward revision labor market data noted adding economy may shakier ground investor assumed last year bitcoin weakness proved temporary fed responded early sign cooling labor market fed softened surprise basis point rate cut september showing supportive backdrop btc price momentum provided another tailwind bitcoin reported earlier federal reserve maintained interest rate last week triggering market selloff research noted would expect decline risk asset first rate cut september followed sharp rebound cut becomes certain publicly validated fed official added recent time bitcoin proven ability weather turbulence inflicted external factor encouraging sign increasing maturity gadi chait head investment xapo bank told cryptonews conviction bitcoin potential still stand undeterred price post stealth trigger might reverse btc shaky market research appeared first cryptonews,0.163,0.712,0.126,-0.6124,0
2025-08-03 19:55:49,49482071,1754250949,Canadian Teen Convicted in $37M Bitcoin Heist and 2020 X Hacking Spree,"A Canadian teen has been sentenced for a $37 million Bitcoin (BTC) heist and the hacking of several X accounts. This follows on-chain sleuth ZachXBT’s calls for stricter penalties against SIM swapping and social engineering fraudsters. Suspect’s Sentence ZachXBT revealed via a July 29 X post that Cameron Redman had been convicted and ordered to pay compensation following his involvement in a $37 million Bitcoin theft and a related X hacking case that the investigator had uncovered. Court documents show that Redman has been sentenced to 12 months and 1 day, followed by a three-year supervised release term for each count, with all sentences to be served concurrently. He has also been ordered to pay a $400 special assessment, $248,257.07 in restitution, and a $60,000 fine. On February 22, 2020, the Canadian teenager used a SIM swap attack to take control of crypto investor Josh Jones’s mobile number, allowing him to bypass two-factor authentication and access his wallets. He then stole 1,547 BTC and 60,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), valued at around $37 million at the time. Following the theft, Redman began laundering the stolen assets through hundreds of small transactions. These tokens were eventually funneled through centralized exchanges in an attempt to hide the trail. The perpetrator was later linked to phishing scams and the hacking of several NFT profiles on X. According to ZachXBT, in June 2022, Redman offered access to an internal X panel for sale on the platform SWAPD. This was then sold for 250 ETH and led to the compromise of over 10 accounts and the theft of millions through phishing scams. The detective added that the Canadian youth initially used fake identity documents on SWAPD before submitting his real information, withdrew the sale proceeds through Tornado Cash, and then deposited the funds into a Stake account. On-chain data linked the wallet he used to the compromised X accounts. The investigation identified victims, including Beeple, DeeKay, Zeneca, Nouns DAO, and JRNY Club. Calls for Tougher Rules The suspect was formally charged on November 17, 2021, by Hamilton Police in Ontario. Authorities recovered $5.4 million in crypto, but the remaining $31.5 million is still missing. At the time of his arrest, Redman was still legally underage, which meant his name remained sealed and his photo was not released. ZachXBT has previously highlighted how this kind of secrecy is part of the problem, saying the convicted criminal’s identity should have been revealed earlier on to prevent further unlawful conduct. Such cases are on the rise, with research from Keepnet Labs showing a 1,055% increase in SIM swap incidents in the UK in 2024. Elliptic’s State of Crypto Scams 2025 analysis also highlighted phishing as a key method used by cybercriminals like North Korea’s Lazarus, with attackers increasingly automating campaigns using AI tools. Meanwhile, ZachXBT previously reported that between November and December last year, a single hacker breached over 15 X accounts, stealing more than $500,000.

2025-08-03 19:48:57,49481811,1754250537,XRP flashes major ‘sell signal’ as temporary price buffer is identified,"Although XRP has gained some ground in the last 24 hours in a bid to breach the $3 resistance, the asset’s technical structure is painting a concerning picture for the short term. According to analysis by Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential recently flashed a sell signal on the three-day chart, prompting a notable price pullback below the $3 mark, he noted in an X post on August 3. The warning signal came after XRP reached highs above $3.60, with the bearish cue suggesting that the latest rally could be running out of steam. The 9-count TD Sequential signal, known for predicting trend exhaustion, appeared just as XRP approached a resistance zone between $3.60 and $4. Since then, prices have been sliding steadily, and the token is now approaching a key short-term support level. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, on-chain data shows that past accumulation behavior points to $2.80 as a temporary buffer for XRP, but real support begins below $2.48. To this end, Martinez identified $2.40 as the critical zone to watch. If XRP continues to bleed lower, this level could act as a final line of defense for bulls to regroup. A failure to hold above $2.40 may open the door for deeper losses, possibly revisiting the $2.00 region. XRP URPD price chart.

2025-08-03 19:30:56,49481165,1754249456,Shiba Inu Faces New Competition—Altcoin Investors Shift to This Trending Token,"Altcoin investors are known for their agility—moving capital toward the next breakout before it hits the mainstream. That’s why all eyes are now on the meme coin sector, where legacy players like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are starting to show signs of exhaustion. SHIB, despite its iconic run, has stalled in recent weeks, leaving some holders to explore fresher, lower-cap alternatives. These moves often happen before the crowd notices, and this time, one particular token is drawing that attention. Analysts now predict a potential 27x return from MAGACOIN FINANCE if current adoption patterns hold. Why SHIB Momentum May Be Peaking After peaking in early 2021, SHIB’s community remained one of the strongest in crypto. But in 2025, price action has been relatively flat. As market-wide liquidity picks up, especially in the meme sector, investors are beginning to rotate funds from older assets into tokens that have yet to experience exponential gains . Blockchain data already shows capital migration toward emerging tokens with meme power, tight supply curves, and high virality. For SHIB holders seeking the next wave, the challenge lies in identifying early-stage projects before listings drive prices up . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Giant Before the Roar One such project now gaining momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With politically charged branding, a fast-expanding online community, and explosive early-stage engagement, it’s emerging as a major contender. According to recent projections, a 27x price explosion might be on the table if current trajectory and adoption patterns continue. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE unique is its combination of viral market appeal and early access scarcity. Market researchers now compare its adoption velocity to the early days of SHIB itself – a coin that also saw explosive early growth due to community intensity and narrative pull. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently in a limited-access stage, and as new investors pile in, the window for strategic entry narrows with each passing day. Analysts and early traders are calling this moment one of the final chances to participate before it hits broader exchanges. Conclusion As the meme coin cycle enters a new phase, projects with strong branding and active communities are dominating social charts. While SHIB’s role in the meme ecosystem remains foundational, capital tends to flow toward asymmetrical opportunities. That dynamic shift is now favoring tokens still in their early momentum phase. Meme coin cycles reward timing. SHIB had its moment, but new tokens are attracting both retail attention and analyst optimism.

2025-08-03 19:30:10,49481069,1754249410,"Bitcoin Treasury Companies Are ‘Logical’ As Government Severely Devalues $37,000,000,000,000 US Debt: Macro Guru Luke Gromen","Macro guru Luke Gromen says the rise of Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury companies is a logical response to the US government’s continued debasement of the dollar. In a new video update on YouTube, Gromen says investors are currently reacting to a large-scale financial bubble that has been “kicked upstairs” through the stock, banking, and housing markets before finally being pushed into the Treasury market. Gromen notes that the only way for the US government to maintain the bubble – rather than face a default or a severe depression to get its fiscal situation back in order – is to devalue its debt via inflation. Now that such a reality is becoming clear to market participants, Gromen says it makes perfect sense that many corporate entities are creating shareholder value by taking advantage of BTC’s strict supply cap. “In my opinion, it’s critical to remember how we got here. We had an equity bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the banking sector and the housing sector, it created a housing bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the Treasury market by backstopping virtually everything… Now the credit risk is at the Treasury market level, except, Treasuries have no credit risk. The government can always just print the money to make interest payments and avoid default. So there’s no credit risk in Treasuries, only inflation risk. So in my opinion, what we’re seeing in Bitcoin treasury companies in particular is logical, in light of this primrose path we’ve followed over the past 25 years. As more and more people begin to realize the only way out of this is severe devaluation of US debt, of US sovereign debt, of Western sovereign debt. In that case, I would expect credit spreads to remain relatively low, because all else equal, I’d rather own an Apple bond or a Microsoft bond than a US Treasury bond.” At time of writing, the US government’s national debt is about $37 trillion.

2025-08-03 19:21:40,49480777,1754248900,Bitfinex Whale Buys 300 $BTC Per Day During Crypto Market Crash,"The crypto market is on the back foot after Bitcoin retreats below the $113K threshold, losing over 21% in trading volume over the past 24 hours. The community sentiment is also pushing into the bear zone as the Fear and Greed Index retreats to neutral. Despite the looming trend, one Bitfinex whale decided this is the right time to invest and started gobbling up Bitcoins at a rate of 300 per day. Blockstream CEO, Adam Back, is the one who pointed it out , while also reminding the community that the same whale was acquiring $BTC at a rate of 1,000 per day back in February. This type of investment in a crypto market has ‘buy the dip’ written all over it, in preparation of an even bigger bull. The Market Goes Down as Eric Trump Pushes ‘Buy the Dip’ Message Eric Trump joins the ‘buy the dip’ crowd by sending the message loud and clear on X . Eric posted the message just as Bitcoin was sinking to $112,724, displaying his undying confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to bounce back. This was expected, given that Eric Trump’s Bitcoin stake is about to get $367M fatter. This would be the direct result of the merger between American Bitcoin Corp. and Gryphon Digital Mining, which would give Eric Trump access to over 367M shares, each valued at $1. The deal is set to undergo stockholder approval on August 27, 2025, and 10 AM ET. The merger, announced on July 29 , would make Eric Trump one of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto sphere, which would rush in a new era for Bitcoin and, by extension, the entire crypto market. But why is the crypto market backpedalling? The most obvious reason is Trump’s tariff suspension ending on Friday , which puts pressure on the global economic system once more. On the bright side, the trade agreement saw tariffs go down for US’s trading partners, especially for countries like the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the EU. Despite that, the feeling of economic uncertainty and turmoil lingers, which, ultimately, benefits the crypto market. This means that we should expect a crypto resurgence once Bitcoin bounces back, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will become top gainers thanks to their blockchain utility. Why Snorter Token ($SNORT) is Perfect for Opportunistic Investors Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the perfect ecosystem for opportunistic investors thanks to Snorter Bot, the trader’s best sniper friend. Snorter Bot is the ideal solution to manual coin hunting, which is typically ineffective and exposes you to scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot circumvents these problems by: Instituting real-time alerts to protect against suspicious projects Sniping hot tokens in milliseconds after liquidity appears; so, no lost opportunity Operating in its Telegram chat-only, eliminating the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions The Copy Trading perk is also great for replicating proven strategies to increase your chance of success. All these advantages recommend Snorter Token ($SNORT) as the best choice for opportunistic traders who lack the time or know-how to engage with the market actively. With Snorter Token, you just tailor the Aardvark Bot according to your needs, give it the sniper rifle, and set it loose. $SNORT is still in presale now with a cash pool of $2.7M and growing and a token price of $0.1001. So, if you want to join the project, you should do it while $SNORT is still at its presale price. Given the project’s utility and following post-launch mainstream adoption, $SNORT could experience a massive chart boost in 2025. You can buy your $SNORT by going to the presale page today. When Will the Crypto Market Recover? With Bitcoin already back above the $114K threshold and a 24-hour growth rate of 0.55%, it’s safe to say that the market is already pushing back. While it’s too early to say whether this is a small bump or the sign of a sustained climb, one thing is certain: Bitcoin will bounce back. And when it does, we should expect a new ATH, following July’s $123,153.22, which will drag the entire market along for the ride. That’s when utility-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) could also see an investor surge. This isn’t financial advice.

2025-08-03 19:15:42,49480576,1754248542,SharpLink Buys the Dip and Adds $100M-Worth of $ETH to its Treasury as $BEST Stands to Gain,"SharpLink bought the dip and added another $100M-worth of $ETH to its Ethereum treasury. Arkham pointed out that the address that moved the $ETH already bought another $800M previously for SharpLink Gaming, with the latest transaction of $108.6M going to Galaxy Digital OTC. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve places SharpLink Gaming second on the list of companies with the largest $ETH reserves, with 438.2K tokens. Bitmine Immersion Tech occupies the first spot with 625K $ETH, while the third place belongs to The Ether Machine with 334.8K coins. According to the same data, 2.26% of the total $ETH supply is spread out between 63 strategic reserves, amounting to 2.73M coins with a value of $9.39B. Institutional Interest for $ETH is Going Up as Bitmine’s Tom Lee Predicts a $60,000 $ETH The data shows that public institutions show an increased interest in Ethereum, with some entities exhibiting aggressive buying strategies. The Ether Machine is one such case, after adding 15,000 $ETH to their treasury recently at an average price of $3,809.97 for a total investment of $56.9M. Moreover, the company also announced that they plan an additional $407M investment , which, if it goes through, would more than double Bitmine’s current $ETH reserves of 625K. As the company put it in their X post, this investment strategy isn’t about profit hunting: ‘We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term – not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.’ Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, also pointed out that Ethereum ETFs are experiencing a price surge , with massive inflows hitting the market. Ethereum’s ETF inflows are currently outperforming Bitcoin, up 13% to Bitcoin’s 8% loss over the past two months. This pro-ETH context, with Wall Street becoming increasingly more interested in the asset, drove Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine, to put $ETH’s Estimated Value Potential (EVP) at $60,000+ . He also thinks that the ETH/BTC ratio is off right now and that it’s likely to match 2024’s numbers soon, which would force $ETH up to $5,707 in the near future. With $ETH booming in charts and a bull run waiting to happen, ERC-20 projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) are likely to catch steam first. How $BEST Fuels One of the Best Non-Custodial Wallet Ecosystems $BEST is the official token of the Best Wallet ecosystem, a non-custodial, KYC-free service that’s perfect for novice and experienced traders alike. Best Wallet’s non-custodial profile translates to higher security, as you control the private key and, thus, the funds. The wallet also offers access to a variety of features, including the Token Launchpad, which grants exclusive access to upcoming tokens, allowing you to invest early. The Market Insights feature is another useful addition, feeding you real-time updates on hot projects, market sentiment, and chart trends. This allows you to make more informed decisions before investing. $BEST is currently in presale with over $14.4M already in the bank. This makes $BEST one of the most successful presales of 2025 and one that sets Best Wallet on the road to success. Based on Best Wallet’s features, public appeal, top security, and the fact that it’s free to use, we expect $BEST to experience a chart boom post launch. $BEST’s growth will further feed the Best Wallet ecosystem, pushing it closer to its underlying goal: to capture over 40% of the crypto wallet market share by 2026 . You can buy $BEST at its presale price of $0.025425 by visiting the official presale page. Will We See Another $ETH ATH in 2025? Given the rising investor interest in $ETH, we may see another Ethereum rally soon, pushing the asset to the psychological threshold of $4,000. We may not get Tom Lee’s $60K Ethereum in 2025, but a goal of $5,700 isn’t impossible, once $ETH clears the $4,000 resistance point. When that happens, projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) will be among the first to see the benefits. This isn’t financial advice.

According to the company's data, the price of BTC fell by 4% in a short period of time, from $118,920 to below $114,000. This move occurred immediately after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs. During the drop, over $195 million worth of long positions in futures were liquidated. At the same time, a total of 21,400 BTC belonging to short-term investors were transferred to exchanges at a loss. CryptoQuant noted that this behavior has been observed in similar price drops before. For example: July 15, 2025: 50,134 BTC moved to exchanges July 25, 2025: 39,105 BTC sent to exchanges Related News: A New Claim About Satoshi Nakamoto's Identity Has Been Made: Could It Be That He Has Been Right in Front of Us All Along? This move has brought Bitcoin to the edge of a critical on-chain support cluster, according to the firm's analysis. CryptoQuant noted that this level is defined as a “gap” below which there is weak liquidity and weak support. According to the analysis firm, the critical areas to watch for the BTC price are as follows: Onchain support: $111,600 Technical support (previous ATH): $112,000 Traders' Realized Price: $105,500 *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-03 19:05:00,49480184,1754247900,Bitcoin Crashes Below $115K as Trump Sparks Nuclear Tensions and Fed Turmoil,"Bitcoin plummeted to $113,164 on Friday, losing nearly 8% within hours and triggering over $200 million in liquidations. The downturn coincides with former President Donald Trump’s aggressive political maneuvering and amid rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia. The market’s dramatic downturn reflects growing investor anxiety as Trump reenters the political landscape with incendiary foreign policy statements and attacks on U.S. economic institutions. Trump Orders Sub Repositioning Amid Russia Standoff Trump’s latest posts on Truth Social revealed a major military action: he ordered two nuclear submarines to reposition amid threats from Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. Medvedev had dismissed Trump’s demand to stop the war in Ukraine within ten days as a “step towards war.” Trump responded, stating that there were now “unintended consequences” with military assets being moved. Markets quickly reacted to the escalation, with Bitcoin leading the retreat. Risk assets faltered as the prospect of renewed nuclear tension rattled global investors. Trump Blasts Fed and Jobs Figures Ahead of Election In a separate series of posts, Trump accused Labor Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of fudging job numbers to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’s chances in the 2024 election. He demanded that she be fired and referred to the numbers as “fake.”. Trump also criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him “a stubborn MORON” and demanding now rate cuts. He urged the Federal Reserve Board to work around Powell’s control, an unprecedented suggestion that breaks with decades of central bank independence. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler Resigns, Opening Trump Path Amidst growing political pressure, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler resigned Friday. Though she gave no definite reason, Kugler’s early departure leaves a key vacancy at the central bank—one Trump would be in a position to fill. Kugler, a Biden appointee and vocal supporter of rate stability, had sat out this week’s policy vote. Her resignation adds to the uncertainty at a time when institutional credibility is under assault from the top offices. Bitcoin in the Crosshairs of Political and Market Uncertainty Bitcoin’s steep drop reflects the market’s flight from risk amid global uncertainty. It now trades 7% beneath its all-time high of $123,182, which was reached a few weeks ago. Analysts point to tightening futures premiums and decreased leveraged activity as signs of momentum that is fading. Against expectations that Bitcoin would serve as a haven during political conflict, the asset has instead followed tech stocks, contradicting the safe-haven narrative. Investors are now shifting to short-term bonds and cash positions. Gold has also held firm at around $3,350, but even it has not been able to offer much comfort. Dalio Reassesses Bitcoin Amid U.S. Debt Fears Amidst the turmoil, some long-term investors are giving Bitcoin’s prospects a second thought. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, now recommends allocating as much as 15% of portfolios to Bitcoin or gold as a hedge against inflation and debt. “The U.S. is beginning a debt doom loop,” Dalio warned, referring to a $12 trillion Treasury forecast. While cautious about Bitcoin’s volatility, he acknowledged its evolving character as a store-of-value asset. Conclusion Bitcoin’s fall below $115,000 is more than a matter of price volatility—it is an indicator of a broader investor flight driven by political uncertainty and economic doubt.

2025-08-03 19:04:30,49480084,1754247870,Did China Ban Cryptocurrency? What The Story Is Really About,"False reports are circulating claiming that China has issued a new ban on cryptocurrency. Some accounts are spreading rumors that China has banned cryptocurrencies again, without any evidence. These claims lack any official statement or legal text. They rely solely on hearsay. According to Bitcoin Junkies, China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China imposed its last major restrictions in September 2021, targeting mining and exchange activities. That policy remains unchanged. No fresh edicts or directives have emerged from Beijing in 2025. WARNING: False reports are circulating claiming that China has issued a new ban on cryptocurrency. China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China banned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies back in 2021, and that policy remains unchanged. pic.twitter.com/6jiasBWEea — Bitcoin Junkies (@BTCjunkies) August 3, 2025 Bitcoin trades at $114,071 USD, with a live market cap of $2.27 trillion. It sees $53.98 billion in 24-hour volume and holds the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. This positions Bitcoin as the leading digital asset, far ahead of competitors in liquidity and adoption. The four key facts you need to know: Hong Kong as a pilot zone embraces crypto. Hong Kong has launched initiatives to attract exchanges and token issuers. Its regulators have rolled out a licensing regime for spot trading platforms. China never banned individual crypto transactions. Private peer-to-peer transfers remain legal. Only institutional participants, banks, payment firms, and funds are prohibited from offering crypto services. Bitcoin mining still occurs in China. Many miners displaced in 2021 shifted abroad, but some resumed operations in regions with looser enforcement. Estimates suggest China still accounts for around 15% of global hash rate. Stablecoins and RWAs gain traction among officials. Chinese authorities explore tokenized real-world assets and regulated stablecoins for on-chain use cases. Pilot programs in Guangdong and Shanghai test asset-backed instruments. What Beijing’s 2021 Ban Covered Exchange closures. All domestic crypto trading platforms were ordered to cease operations. Mining shut-down. Major mining provinces rescinded power allocations for crypto-heavy users. Financial institutions barred. Banks and payment providers were forbidden from clearing crypto transactions. That framework persists today. No new clauses have been introduced. No new fines have been announced. Hong Kong SAR operates under a separate legal system. It launched its new crypto licensing regime in June 2024. The Securities and Futures Commission now issues licenses to spot exchanges and custodians. This makes Hong Kong one of Asia’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Its pilot zone model aims to draw talent, capital, and blockchain projects away from Silicon Valley and Dubai. On-chain Reality Shows China’s Strong Belief Despite official bans, Chinese nationals still hold and transact crypto. Peer-to-peer OTC desks thrive on messaging apps. VPN-enabled access to foreign exchanges remains common. On-chain data shows persistent activity. Bitcoin’s on-chain transfer volume averages over $20 billion daily, with a sizeable share originating from IPs linked to China. Further Considerations China continues to explore digital currency with its central bank digital currency (e-CNY). That project does not equate to an outright ban on all private crypto. Instead, it reflects a desire to maintain monetary sovereignty and clamp down on illicit finance. As regulators study tokenized stocks, bonds, and commodities, China may issue further guidelines on real-world assets (RWAs) and stablecoins. These moves will shape the next phase of blockchain adoption on the mainland. In sum, the rumor of a fresh China crypto ban is just that, a rumor. China’s 2021 restrictions remain in force. No new prohibitions have been introduced. Meanwhile, Hong Kong forges ahead with open-market policies, and private transactions continue on Chinese-controlled networks. The crypto community can rest easy: nothing new has changed in Beijing’s rulebook. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-08-03 19:03:40,49480076,1754247820,First-Ever Chinese Digital Bond Minted on XRP Ledger,"Guotai Junan International Holdings Limited (GTJAI) has issued the first publicly offered digital bond by a Chinese securities firm, a development that reflects the evolving landscape of capital markets in Asia. The bond, denominated in U.S. dollars with a size capped at $300 million and a three-year maturity, is the first digitally native bond from a Chinese brokerage to be offered to the public. The offering was carried out through HSBC Orion, a distributed ledger-based digital assets platform, with GTJAI serving as both lead joint coordinator and issuer. @MichaelLINY, a crypto educator on X, revealed that the digital bond was minted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The digital bond uses blockchain infrastructure to enhance transparency, streamline issuance, and reduce settlement inefficiencies common in traditional finance. The company says this move aligns with its broader push for innovation in financial services, particularly through technologies that support programmable and secure instruments. GTJAI stated that it will use this issuance as an opportunity to explore cross-border digital asset issuance and other innovative finance applications. First ever Chinese Digital Bond minted on the #XRP Ledger GTJAI Successfully Issued the First Publicly Offered Digital Bond of a Chinese Securities Firm ..This transaction demonstrates the capabilities of HSBC Orion to enable both a broader range of digital bonds and issuers.… pic.twitter.com/EbuKp7jUcz — The light shines in the darkness (@MatthewLINY) August 2, 2025 Signs of XRP’s Growing Infrastructure Role HSBC Orion has developed capabilities that can integrate with various DLT environments, including those supported by Ripple’s institutional-grade custody partner, Metaco. Notably, HSBC and Ripple-owned Metaco entered into a partnership in late 2023 to launch tokenized securities custody solutions, a move that firmly aligns the bank with Ripple’s blockchain ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The XRPL is recognized for its efficiency in settling tokenized assets and other fixed-income products, such as bonds and treasury bills . Although it was not directly referenced in the GTJAI deal, its technological compatibility and Ripple’s growing institutional presence are increasingly relevant as firms like HSBC expand custody and issuance infrastructure for digital bonds. The involvement of Ripple-linked entities in key layers of infrastructure hints at the possibility of XRP or XRPL-related rails used in future capital market deployments, especially as the tokenization market grows . Institutional Leaders Embrace Blockchain Technology Zhang Xueming, GTJAI’s Chief Financial Officer, described the issuance as both a proof of technological leadership and a demonstration of the firm’s commitment to next-generation financial services. HSBC’s John O’Neill, who leads the bank’s digital assets division, commented that the partnership allows HSBC Orion to support “a broader range of digital bonds and issuers.” With the bank already embedding custody infrastructure through Ripple’s Metaco, HSBC’s role in bridging traditional finance and tokenized instruments continues to deepen.

2025-08-03 19:00:55,49480085,1754247655,Best Way to Make Money With Crypto,"In the world of crypto, one principle remains undefeated: timing. Not just buying low and selling high, but entering before the wave begins. From Bitcoin’s earliest days at under $1 to Ethereum’s quiet beginnings at $0.30, the biggest winners were not those with the most capital—but those with the most foresight. Fast forward to 2025, and the opportunity hasn’t disappeared. If anything, it’s evolved. Now, smart investors are hunting for tokens that offer asymmetric upside—projects with strong narratives, emerging communities, and clear signals of momentum before mainstream exposure kicks in. This approach is what turns $500 into $50,000, and helps level the playing field between retail traders and institutions. Today’s profit strategies go beyond holding Bitcoin or earning yield through DeFi. While those approaches offer stability, the fastest gains still come from early entry into under-the-radar altcoins —especially those with viral branding, limited access windows, and traction that mirrors early crypto giants. But identifying the right project requires more than hype. With tools like on-chain analysis, Telegram activity trackers, and social volume aggregators, today’s investor has sharper insight than ever before into what’s building beneath the surface. Why Early-Stage Tokens Still Offer the Best ROI Most projects don’t go 100x. But those that do usually share a few common traits—and they all rewarded those who recognized the patterns early. In recent months, one particular token has been making waves for just that reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention across platforms like X and Telegram not simply for its meme appeal, but for the velocity of its adoption. Crypto research groups tracking social metrics say its early trajectory mirrors the rise of Ethereum Classic, two tokens that generated major returns for initial adopters. But unlike older assets that are now deep into their market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth curve . The project’s viral branding, combined with a limited-access phase, has created a rush among early participants. Every round has seen rapid sellouts, and the project’s social growth has already rivaled meme giants like Dogecoin in their infancy. Analysts now forecast that its current pricing window may be one of the last remaining chances for sharp asymmetric entry before broader exchange access resets the opportunity. How to Spot High-Upside Tokens Before the Crowd Spotting altcoins before they explode isn’t about luck—it’s about pattern recognition. Historically, the biggest crypto winners showed early signs long before their names hit mainstream headlines. These included subtle metrics like surging social media growth, increasing wallet holders, and high engagement rates on social channels like X and Telegram . They also tended to feature emotionally resonant branding, whether political, cultural, or comedic—something that hooks communities and sustains hype across weeks or months. Another key factor? Scarcity of access. The earliest-stage tokens that go on to make 10x–100x moves are often available only for a limited time through exclusive, time-sensitive windows. Once listed on major exchanges, these assets usually price in their potential, leaving little room for exponential gains . The most strategic investors understand this—they track momentum, measure community velocity, and look for entry points when the crowd is still on the sidelines. Final Thoughts: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Act Early The best way to make money in crypto has always been clear— get in before everyone else realizes what’s happening . Whether it’s through identifying social trends, spotting wallet inflows, or analyzing price structure before breakout, timing and conviction are the real tools of the trade. In today’s cycle, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum precisely because they offer that rare mix: powerful community traction, viral positioning, and limited access. And as history has shown, when these elements align, the results can be game-changing .

2025-08-03 19:00:23,49480469,1754247623,Ireland’s central bank chief says October annual budget might harm the economy,"The Irish central bank’s governor, Gabriel Makhlouf, has raised concerns about the government’s focus on enhancing the economy in its October annual budget. Makhlouf warns that the country could be in a bad situation if the government pushes its agenda to boost spending excessively. This statement comes two weeks after the government’s October annual budget proposals were released. The plans comprised a 6.4% increase in spending that everyone needed to adhere to. Meanwhile, this increase in spending, according to analysis from sources, is lower compared to the past budgets set, which ranged between 8% to 9%. Makhlouf raises concerns over the government’s recently released budget plan During an interview, Makhlouf explained that additional stimulus in the sector is unnecessary when an economy is fully employed . Therefore, based on his argument, the government should reconsider its budget plan. The Irish central bank’s governor also pointed out that the country’s economy was in a bad state, urging that the government’s plan could further worsen the situation. On the other hand, in an earlier announcement, the government had mentioned making changes in tax cuts and spending. Following these changes, the agency vowed to reduce the suggested 9.4 billion euro tax cuts and higher expenditure in 2026, if Trump increases the tariff rates above the 10% currently set. Coincidentally, after the agency made public its budget plans in the Summer Economic Statement, the US struck a trade deal with the EU, which resulted in a 15% import tariff on goods from the EU. Concerning the budget plan in the Summer Economic Statement, Makhlouf expressed that he hoped the government would consider changing this plan and make a final one. He concluded, “By then, the government will have thought again about what the trade situation is showing us.” Ireland’s infrastructure lags behind compared to its economic rivals Last month, Prime Minister Micheal Martin announced plans to raise Ireland’s spending on infrastructure by 30%. This increment in spending came after Apple made a €14 billion, or $16 billion , tax payment to the country. Apart from the tax payment, funds raised from selling bank shares also contributed to this significant change. This followed warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Ireland had fallen behind its economic rivals in terms of infrastructure. The report also reported that the country has not utilized tax revenue from the multinationals for years to improve its ailing energy sector, water systems, and housing supply. To address these challenges, the agency has revealed that it intends to shift its focus towards enhancing the energy sector with significant capital investment plans and diversifying energy sources, improving its infrastructure, starting with public transport like roads, and boosting water services in the country to improve housing availability. However, to successfully improve housing availability, Ireland’s national water utility stated that it would require significant funds to supply water services adequately. With its revenue challenges, the government finds it hard to achieve these goals, especially improving housing availability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-08-03 19:00:06,49479933,1754247606,"Live Games, 300% Bonus, & Instant Withdrawals: Here’s How Spartans Beats DraftKings and Betsson in 2025","Bonus offers, marketing campaigns, and strategic expansions fill the betting space, but not every platform excels where it truly matters: clarity, ease of use, and fairness. Betsson has just made a move into Brazil, building a customized platform aligned with local rules. DraftKings continues to grow in the U.S. with stronger live betting features and new lottery integrations. While these efforts push both forward, crypto-first users still face gaps in speed, transparency, and global access. That’s where Spartans steps ahead. It offers 5,963 games, a 300% welcome bonus with clearly outlined terms, and fast crypto withdrawals. With sportsbook access across top leagues, it brings unmatched convenience and value. DraftKings: Advanced Tech, Traditional Limits DraftKings holds strong brand recognition in digital sports betting. Its public NASDAQ listing and recent analyst projections, like Bernstein’s $46 price target, reflect confidence in its growth, largely due to its in-game betting systems. The acquisition of SimpleBet boosted its pricing tech, making real-time bets more accurate and widespread. It also added Jackpocket to expand into digital lottery, allowing cross-promotion between sports betting and lottery players. Users can choose from slots, blackjack, roulette, sportsbook access, and fantasy sports. Yet, some drawbacks remain. DraftKings is mainly built for fiat users, with slow withdrawals and restricted access based on region. Bonus offers differ by location and are often buried in fine print. For those seeking faster crypto use and global flexibility, DraftKings may fall short of being the best pick. Betsson: Building Trust in Regional Markets Betsson is focusing on regulated growth in emerging areas. Its Brazil launch, through a local partnership, adds to its presence in Colombia and Argentina. The company’s approach prioritizes legal compliance and tailored platforms offering sports betting, casino games, and virtual sports. Betsson also launched a responsible gambling campaign in Brazil, supporting safer play with education and awareness tools. This effort has earned praise from industry watchers as a responsible way to grow in new markets. Still, crypto-friendly users may find the platform lacking. Withdrawal speeds are slower, bonuses lack transparency upfront, and there’s limited public access to fairness metrics like RTP. While Betsson continues to grow in localized spaces, it doesn’t yet fully meet the expectations of speed or crypto accessibility. Spartans: Fast Crypto, Clear Bonuses, and 5,963 Games That Work Smoothly Spartans wasn’t made to follow outdated designs; it was built to fix their weak points. That’s why crypto users are turning to it. With 5,963 casino titles, an all-in-one sportsbook from soccer to MMA, and instant crypto payout systems, Spartans delivers on clarity, speed, and utility. The 300% welcome bonus comes with upfront rules, users know the 35x playthrough, 7-day window, and max cashout before depositing. These terms remain stable across all regions, which is a rare advantage over DraftKings and Betsson. What also makes a difference is how quickly users get their funds. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT, withdrawals are handled instantly. Game fairness is backed by published RTP and provably fair systems. Whether playing roulette, blackjack, or live bets, the performance remains smooth. Spartans also stands out with features others skip: mobile access with no need for an app, a fully disclosed affiliate setup (CPA, Rev Share, Hybrid), and a Lamborghini prize draw for top members. For those evaluating the best betting sites based on features that matter, Spartans delivers results where others still fall behind. Final Thoughts DraftKings is leaning into live betting and lottery tools. Betsson is growing with a regulation-focused model in Latin America. But both still leave major gaps, especially for those who want fast cashouts, upfront bonuses, and global crypto options. Spartans answers those needs directly. With over 5,900 games, worldwide sportsbook access, and bonus terms that are clearly stated, Spartans shows that the best betting site isn’t defined by name recognition, it’s about delivery. With instant crypto withdrawals and fair play built in, Spartans isn’t just a challenger, it’s a better choice.

2025-08-03 19:00:06,49481521,1754247606,"Bloomberg Analyst Says Crypto Is Falling Behind, Despite Bitcoin Strength","Mike McGlone, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, has recently shared a warning about the future of cryptocurrencies. He says that while Bitcoin (BTC) is still doing well, the rest of the crypto market is not keeping up with other big assets like stocks, gold, and government bonds. He said that Bitcoin and the U.S. Treasury bonds could become two of the best-performing investments this year, especially during tough economic times. Crypto Returns Match Stocks But With Higher Risk McGlone pointed to lower investor demand and high interest rates as reasons why many digital coins are under pressure . So far in 2025, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) has gained 7%. This matches the year-to-date return of the S&P 500, the main stock market index in the United States. However, McGlone warns that this comparison is misleading. Although he acknowledged that the crypto market is maturing, high volatility makes it more risky. According to McGlone, crypto gives the same return as the S&P 500 but with four times the volatility. He highlighted that investors are taking on much more risk for the same level of profit. At the same time, the Bloomberg Dollar Index has fallen by 7.5% this year. A weaker dollar usually helps push up asset prices, including crypto. Even with this drop, most cryptocurrencies are still not doing well. This adds to McGlone’s argument that the market is not as strong as it appears. Bitcoin May Still Lead, But the Rest May Struggle While McGlone sees problems in the wider crypto market, he still expects the flagship crypto to do well. In his view, Bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bonds are the most likely to perform well this year. This may seem like a contradiction, but McGlone sees long-term value in Bitcoin, calling it a digital form of gold because of its limited supply and adoption rate. However, he also warns that Bitcoin’s success may depend on how the stock market behaves. Furthermore, McGlone also predicts that the stock market will fall sharply. His warning followed a 1.6% fall in the S&P 500 last Friday. This drop caused weaker-than-expected jobs data, which raised concerns about the strength of the economy. Bitcoin Drops After July High In July 2025, Bitcoin hit a record high of $122,838, but since then, its price has dropped to about $112,113. Other cryptocurrencies have fallen even more. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $113,789, up 0.93% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analyst Mike McGlone once said Bitcoin could fall as low as $10,000. Although this has not happened yet, he still stands by his warning. Even though some people disagree with him , McGlone still believes the crypto market could see a big drop.

In the companies’ latest earnings calls, executives from Visa and Mastercard – which handle $13.2 trillion and $8 trillion in payments globally per year, respectively – signaled that the giants were ready to embrace rather than fight stablecoins. Says Visa CEO Ryan McInerney, “…Stablecoins could enable us to have faster cross-border transactions. By the way, that’s true for consumers or for businesses. And we’ve been testing that out and having some good results. We’ve been testing a series of corridors and putting stablecoins to work directly versus the fiat currency money movement options that we’re able to deliver to our clients and their users today… I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that there is real product market fit for stablecoins in remittances for certain corridors. And as the largest money movement platform around the world, we’re going to be an early adopter of a lot of those things on behalf of our clients and their end users.” And in Mastercard’s Q2 earnings call , CEO Michael Miebach also suggested that stablecoins weren’t so much of a threat to the company, but an asset to augment its services. “And as to stablecoins, we see this as another currency. We also see it as additive to the network with opportunities for us to provide the on and off ramps from fiat to stablecoin to partner with [ advice ] and wallets to bring interoperability, bring relevant services, bring global reach and trust to the specific use cases.

The Satoshi Nakamoto statue in Parco Ciani has vanished. Satoshigallery , the group behind the global statue initiative, confirms the theft. The work stood proud since October 25, 2024, debuting at the Plan ₿ Forum, a joint push by the city and Tether to boost crypto adoption. Where is Satoshi? We are offering 0.1 btc to whoever will help us recovering the Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto that was stolen yesterday in Lugano. You can steal our symbol but you will never be able to steal our souls. Thank you all for the nice messages. We are all in this… https://t.co/cAGCqg4CuP pic.twitter.com/iGrBOdVYhe — Satoshigallery (@satoshigallery) August 3, 2025 Last night, someone stole and smashed the bronze likeness. Early reports say the vandal left broken pieces behind, and hours later locals spotted fragments floating in the lake. Police cordoned off the scene and launched a thorough probe,no suspects have been named. Satoshigallery offered a 0.1 BTC reward (≈ $11,900) for tips leading to its recovery, stating, “You can steal our symbol, but you will never be able to steal our souls.” At today’s price of $118,995 per BTC, that bounty stands firm. Not everyone agreed it was a calculated theft. X user @Grittoshi claimed that during Swiss National Day on August 1, intoxicated revelers near the Aur Café simply overturned the statue,welded by just two points,into Lake Lugano as a prank, insisting “cameras are everywhere” and “no way they could cart it off.” Fragments lay scattered, a sad symbol of celebratory excess. Story Update On Satoshi Nakamoto Statue Municipal divers and recovery teams have now retrieved the statue,broken but intact,from Lake Lugano. Satoshigallery publicly thanked the city of Lugano for their swift action, confirming the sculpture is back in their care for restoration. We want to thank the Municipality of Lugano @luganomycity for helping us to recover the statue that was thrown into the lake. https://t.co/UyKhyBvt1m pic.twitter.com/qaHFWXIHRs — Satoshigallery (@satoshigallery) August 3, 2025 Local businesses report that tourist foot traffic dipped since the incident; city officials have pledged support for restoration and will tighten security at Parco Ciani and future crypto-themed exhibitions. Meanwhile, Satoshigallery remains undeterred: plans to cast and install Satoshi statues in 21 cities worldwide are still on track. This episode proves a cautionary tale: public crypto art can galvanize communities but also requires robust protection. Through broken bronze, ripples in the lake, and now a successful recovery, the Satoshi saga continues,an emblem of blockchain’s resilience and the enduring spirit of its community.

2025-08-03 18:38:56,49479113,1754246336,Ripple Price Analysis: These Are XRP’s Next Defense Lines After a Breakdown Below $3,"Ripple’s price is experiencing a pullback after an impulsive rally that began in June. As both the USDT and BTC pairs are now showing signs of bearish momentum, investors are cautiously looking to see if the available support levels can hold and prevent a full-on reversal. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the XRP/USDT pair, Ripple’s token has been rising since early July, before sweeping the liquidity above the $3.40 high and reversing to the downside. The market is currently pulling back toward both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are located near the $2.50 mark, and have just created a bullish crossover. As things stand, the $3.00 level is lost, and if a quick recovery back above this level does not occur, the mentioned moving averages will be the next targets. While the convergence of these moving averages creates a potentially strong support, if it gets broken to the downside, a much deeper drop toward the $1.60 area would be probable. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair is going through a similar pullback, following a swift rejection from the 3,200 SAT resistance zone. The price is currently testing the 200-day moving average and the higher boundary of the broken descending channel around the 2,500 SAT mark. The RSI has also dropped from deeply overbought levels to just below 50, showing a clear shift in momentum. If the 2,500 SAT support zone gets broken to the downside, the price will drop back into the channel, and would likely pull toward the 2,000 SAT area. This scenario would potentially result in a lengthy consolidation and reset the current bullish trend.

2025-08-03 18:35:59,49478972,1754246159,Bitcoin Price Analysis: $100K Breakdown Looms for BTC if This Support Fails,"Bitcoin came under notable selling pressure following heightened geopolitical concerns stemming from the escalating conflict between Russia and the United States over nuclear threats. Despite the bearish momentum, the cryptocurrency has now reached a key support zone, expected to hold in the short term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After a prolonged consolidation within the $116K–$123K range, BTC encountered heavy selling pressure, driven by escalating concerns over the Russia–US nuclear conflict. This led to a breakdown below the critical $114K support, sparking fear and uncertainty in the market. However, BTC has now approached a major support zone between $111K and $112K, an area defined by the lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel and a key previous swing high. This confluence of technical support is likely to attract patient buyers, potentially initiating a bullish consolidation phase. Still, if the price fails to hold above this region, a rapid decline toward the psychological $100K level could follow. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s breakdown from the bullish flag pattern marks a bearish technical signal, confirming the pattern’s failure. The sharp rejection from the flag’s upper boundary triggered a steep decline, bringing the price to a critical support near the $112K zone, which also aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This particular one often acts as a magnet for short-term bullish reactions. As long as the price holds above this range, a corrective bounce is likely. However, if bearish momentum persists, another sell-off targeting a sweep below $111K–$112K may occur. Until then, short-term consolidation remains the most probable outcome. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Exchange Netflow indicator shows that 16,417 BTC flowed into exchanges yesterday, the highest daily net inflow since mid-July. This suggests a significant number of holders are moving their Bitcoin to exchanges, typically a precursor to selling activity. At the same time, the Exchange Whale Ratio surged above 0.70, indicating that the majority of these deposits came from large holders (whales). Historically, when whale-dominated inflows coincide with elevated exchange activity, the market often faces increased selling pressure and price declines. If this trend continues and whales persist in depositing BTC at this pace, further downside risk could follow. Such activity may reflect profit-taking, preparation for a correction, or strategic reallocation in anticipation of near-term volatility.

2025-08-03 18:30:55,49478831,1754245855,Slow And Steady: Bitcoin’s Current Rise Feels Different—Study,"Bitcoin’s recent climb has been calm and measured, a sharp contrast to the explosive rallies of the past. It’s trading above its historical growth path, but far from overheating. Long-time holders remain mostly inactive, while the bulk of trading activity is coming from fresh faces in the market. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst Bitcoin Growth Remains On Track Based on reports by Arab Chain using CryptoQuant data, Bitcoin’s price is tracking a Power Law trend that suggests a smooth, logarithmic rise over time. That model creates a curved path rather than sudden spikes. Right now, BTC sits above the expected growth line but well below the upper “red zone” that signals overheating. The divergence indicator is positive, yet far from levels seen in past bubbles. This pattern hints at natural growth or perhaps the early stages of renewed betting. Divergence Keeps Room For Upside Analysts note that staying below the top watch zone leaves room for more gains before panic sets in. In prior cycles, prices shot through that red zone and then collapsed. Today, Bitcoin is about $50,000 under its most recent peak level. That gap suggests buyers still have breathing room if they choose to push prices higher. On-chain data from Glassnode shows short-term holders (STHs) are behind most of the action. Around 86% of Bitcoin’s spent volume over the last 24 hours came from wallets active less than 155 days, totaling $18 billion. Long-term holders (LTHs) accounted for only 14.5% of spent volume, or $3.10 billion. That split means newer entrants are driving swings, while veteran holders stay largely on the sidelines. Long-Term Holders Show Conviction That dichotomy between STHs and LTHs tends to indicate intense conviction among core believers. When long-term owners remain in place, price drops tend to be more subtle. Buyers who have hung on for years or months typically view dips as opportunity to add rather than times to sell. Bitcoin was trading around $114,113 at press time following a pullback from recent highs of about $118K. The daily Relative Strength Index had fallen to 43, indicating a loss of bullish momentum without going into oversold levels. On-Balance Volume has been declining in the past week, indicating weakening buying pressure.

2025-08-03 18:30:00,49479258,1754245800,"Bitcoin (BTC) Slips Below $115K, but Analysts Still Predict $1M, What Crypto to Buy Now Before the Next Wave?","The crypto market is shifting gears, and while headlines focus on Bitcoin’s recent pullback, investors are already looking ahead. With BTC dipping under $115,000, some view it as a signal of cooling momentum—but for others, it’s the calm before another major run. One question keeps surfacing: if Bitcoin still has room to 10x long-term, what other cryptocurrency is poised to outperform before the next wave starts? That question is drawing attention to a growing DeFi project that’s still under the radar— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.035, it offers a rare opportunity to enter early with clear utility, real yield potential, and a strong roadmap. But before diving into that, let’s address Bitcoin’s current position and why its long-term outlook still drives optimism. Bitcoin (BTC) Dips, Long-Term Vision Holds Bitcoin’s recent slide below $115K may look alarming on the surface, but market analysts aren’t rattled. The pullback came amid renewed global trade uncertainty, short-term profit-taking, and thinner summer market activity. Still, BTC has held above its critical $110K support, and many believe this is just a pause within a broader bullish structure. Firms such as ARK Invest and Cantor Fitzgerald continue to support a strong long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Both expect the asset to reach $1 million by the end of the decade. This forecast is rooted in growing institutional demand, shrinking available supply, and Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity model. Notably, Cantor analysts cite capital reallocation by public companies and sovereign wealth strategies as key factors pushing the price beyond current highs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. It’s not just another token trying to ride the wave—Mutuum is building a decentralized infrastructure around real, scalable utility. Currently in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035, with over 14,700 holders already on board and more than $13.8 million raised to date. That level of early traction is notable for a project still in its pre-launch phase. Anyone getting in now is already locking in a short-term gain, with the listing price set at $0.06—a clear step up from the current entry point. But what’s driving attention even more is the potential for continued momentum once MUTM starts trading on major centralized exchanges. Considering the project’s utility, growing community, and post-launch roadmap, many believe the price won’t stop at $0.06. By locking in at $0.035 today, investors could see their entry appreciate by 200–300% over the coming months, especially as exchange listings, the platform’s beta release, and the buy-and-redistribute mechanism start to build momentum. Unlike projects that rely purely on hype, MUTM is backed by real DeFi features like lending, borrowing, and an overcollateralized stablecoin—giving it fundamentals that support long-term value, not just short-term speculation. This combination of early-stage pricing, token utility, and a clear rollout plan makes Mutuum Finance one of the best crypto projects to watch before the next market leg up. Why It’s Gaining Attention The protocol allows users to lend and borrow digital assets using smart contract-based pools, removing the need for centralized intermediaries. What sets it apart is how it balances both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending models, giving users flexibility based on their strategy and risk tolerance. Another standout feature is the introduction of an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted only when a borrower locks up sufficient assets. This stablecoin isn’t backed by a separate pool—it’s generated on demand and burned upon repayment. That makes it more efficient and resilient than many existing models. Holders who deposit assets into the system receive mtTokens, which automatically accumulate value from interest. These tokens represent the user’s share in the protocol and can be staked to earn passive rewards. And here’s where it gets even more interesting—the revenue from borrowing activity is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. It’s a self-contained yield engine that grows with platform activity. And with Layer 2 optimization in development, the team is pushing to reduce gas fees and scale usage further—key for any DeFi platform aiming to onboard more users. While Bitcoin’s path to $1 million is still unfolding, the question for many isn’t if BTC will rise again—it’s where to look while it consolidates. For those searching for the next big cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance offers a mix of timing, utility, and upside that few other tokens can match at this stage. With a fixed listing price of $0.06, a utility-driven ecosystem, and a token model designed for long-term sustainability, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most compelling investments of the year—especially before the broader market turns bullish again.

2025-08-03 18:29:00,49479257,1754245740,2 Altcoins That Could Eclipse Cardano (ADA) This Cycle – One Is Still Trading Below $0.10,"Cardano has always been a top altcoin within the blockchain world, typically on the list of Ethereum rivals. Yet while it’s still soaring in the portfolios of investors, the focus is shifting toward newer coins with more growth and actual usability. One such dark horse is gaining steam under the radar — and it’s still trading higher than $0.10. And with a successful presale and beta product already under its belt, this new crypto called Remittix (RTX) is poised to jump over many of the industry leaders. Cardano vs Litecoin – Which Legacy Alt Will Survive? Cardano (ADA) is at $0.7115, making steady but unimpressive gains. The blockchain features a peer-reviewed development process, but with that cautious strategy have come delays and missed chances in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Although maintaining a market capitalization of more than $25 billion, ADA’s expansion has decelerated. Recent updates like Hydra and Mithril have improved performance but the ecosystem still does not feel mass adoption of dApps and DeFi protocols similar to other networks. Litecoin (LTC), on the other hand, remains a solid contender because of its fast transactions and low fees. It is trading for $108.00 and has seen a 2.17% 24-hour gain. Its market capitalization stands at approximately $8.22 billion, and its volume is climbing gradually, aided by its reputation as a testing ground for Bitcoin. But even ADA and LTC have not been the ones to innovate in the area of utility. As the industry keeps moving towards utility-based use cases like crypto-to-fiat payments, remittance, and low gas fee crypto use cases, the two projects are now starting to look like legacy tech. The Real Challenger: Remittix (RTX) One project is filling this gap with a solution for an urgent real-world problem: sending and spending crypto as fiat. Remittix, currently priced at $0.0895 , is building a cross-chain wallet that facilitates real-time crypto-to-fiat transactions to bank accounts in more than 30 countries. As Cardano makes further progress towards real-world applications, Remittix already has raised more than $18 million in its current presale, with 579 million RTX tokens sold. It’s now firmly established that the Remittix Wallet Beta will launch live in Q3 2025, with Solana, Dogecoin, and other leading tokens supported.

2025-08-03 18:25:00,49478825,1754245500,3 Meme Coins To Watch and Buy in The First Week Of August 2025,"As August begins, meme coins spark excitement in the crypto community. These tokens combine community spirit, quirky stories, and growth potential, appealing to investors beyond traditional assets. Three coins stand out: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , SPX6900 (SPX), and Test Coin (TST). Here’s a closer look at what’s driving their traction and why they deserve a place on your radar. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Surpasses $13 Million in Presale Funds Little Pepe’s presale journey has been a steady climb rather than a sudden burst. A phased pricing model rewards early participants by gradually increasing token prices at each stage, encouraging timely entry and sustainable growth over sudden spikes. Currently in Stage 8, Little Pepe tokens are priced at $0.0017, and nearly 98% of the allocation for this stage has been claimed. The presale distributed over 8.9 billion tokens, raising over $13 million. Steady support highlights a strong community that values transparency and a community-focused approach. One of LILPEPE’s key strengths is its underlying technology. LILPEPE is built on Ethereum Layer 2, providing faster transactions with lower fees. As LILPEPE’s presale Stage 8 nears completion, excitement grows for Stage 9, which will further raise the token price. This prepares the meme coin for a solid foundation for future growth, institutional partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. LILPEPE’s presale performance, combined with its growing community and technical backbone, positions it as one of the meme coins with promising staying power in 2025. The LILPEPE team is also hosting a giveaway worth $770,000, with 10 lucky wallets each winning $77,000. This move is attracting both traders and crypto enthusiasts alike to partake in the meme coin’s presale. For those seeking exposure to a meme token that balances enthusiasm with real utility potential, Little Pepe is one to watch closely this month. SPX6900 (SPX) Hits New Highs Amid Technical Signals SPX6900 has quietly been making moves lately, hitting an all-time high of $2.21 and marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. The price action suggests that it has entered a discovery phase where buyers remain interested despite already strong performance. Technical analysis shows SPX targeting the 1.272 Fibonacci level near $3.07, based on earlier swings. MACD indicates bullish strength with a rising green histogram. RSI at 71 overbought signals caution. SPX’s recent gains and technical backdrop make it an intriguing meme coin for those who closely monitor charts. It’s a token riding the wave of momentum, but also reminding investors to manage risk carefully as it approaches critical resistance levels. Test Coin (TST): The Meme That Refused to Fade Test Coin has a unique story in the meme coin scene. It started as a joke, launched on a developer network with low expectations. Despite this, the community embraced it, turning it into a decentralized governance experiment and meme culture symbol. With over $4.5 million in trading volume and a DAO voting on quirky updates, Test Coin is known for unpredictability and humor. Last week’s stunt replaced the website with a QR code linking to a Nicolas Cage meme, which coincidentally caused a price rise. Despite—or perhaps because of—its lack of conventional utility, Test Coin has become one of the most talked-about memecoins of 2025. Enthusiasts affectionately call it “the coin with no utility that outperformed half of Solana,” underscoring its viral momentum. Final Thoughts As August 2025 begins, the meme coin scene continues to buzz with activity. Little Pepe combines community, tech, and transparent presale for long-term growth. The SPX6900 remains bullish but risks becoming overbought. Test Coin surprises with unique memes and decentralized choices. Observing these projects may reveal future winners.

2025-08-03 18:15:55,49478561,1754244955,Exploring High Potential Cryptocurrencies Beyond the Mainstream,"Amidst the bustling activity of cryptocurrency markets, Pepe Coin has been a frequent topic of discussion due to its potential to achieve a market cap of $50 billion. However, the spotlight is now shifting to lesser-known, low-cap coins such as Remittix (RTX) , which are poised for significant growth. Remittix, in particular, is creating buzz with its ongoing presale and the development of a utility-driven product that aims to streamline financial transactions across borders. This shift in focus from high-cap, hype-driven coins to utility-based low-cap gems could redefine investment strategies in the crypto space. The Appeal of Low-Cap Cryptocurrencies Low-cap cryptocurrencies like Remittix offer a unique appeal due to their potential for rapid appreciation. Their smaller market caps mean they can experience significant price movements from relatively modest investments, attracting both retail and experienced investors seeking high returns. Remittix: A Closer Look at its Market Potential Remittix stands out not just for its promising financial technology but also for its strategic market positioning. With a live presale that has already captivated a considerable audience, Remittix is paving the way for substantial growth in the fintech sector. Remittix's upcoming product, the Remittix Wallet, is slated for release in Q3 2025. It promises to support crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, accommodating a wide range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. This innovation is particularly aimed at freelancers, expatriates, and small businesses who require efficient, cost-effective international payment solutions. Why Investors are Turning to Remittix The current financial landscape demands more than just digital assets; it requires solutions that resolve actual economic and transactional challenges. Remittix addresses these needs head-on, distinguishing itself from other meme-driven cryptocurrencies, including the more popular Pepe Coin and Troll (SOL). While Pepe Coin might boast a robust market cap and Troll (SOL) shows occasional price spikes, their growth is largely fueled by market sentiment rather than underlying utility. Remittix's approach, which combines a strong technological foundation with practical financial solutions, presents a more sustainable growth trajectory. As the crypto market evolves, the focus is gradually shifting from speculative investments towards those that offer real-world applications. This pivot could see projects like Remittix not just succeeding but potentially dominating the PayFi sector.

2025-08-03 18:15:22,49478211,1754244922,"Pepe Coin Could Hit $50 B, But Analysts Say The Real 100x Gains Lie in These Low‑Cap Gems","Memecoin markets are in an uproar. As Pepe Coin looms over headlines with the possibility of reaching a $50 billion market cap, various analysts speculate that low-cap gems like Remittix (RTX) have much higher potential for upside. With an actual product under production and a live presale already generating hype, Remittix is quickly becoming a utility-based altcoin that may be overshadowing the hype. Let's see the key stats and why it could beat the hype-driven big boys. Pepe Coin and Troll (SOL): Prices, Market Caps, and Volume Trends Pepe Coin is quoted at around $0.00001009, down 4.3%, with a market cap of around $4.29 billion and a daily volume of $712 million, down nearly 27%. Troll (SOL), a low-cap meme token listed on Solana, is currently trading at $0.062–$0.063 today, up over 20%, with a market cap of roughly $62 million and volume of roughly $14–15 million, though that amount dipped by 27% recently. These numbers show how fast meme tokens can pump—or bleed. But none of them address a real problem in the crypto space. Why Low‑Cap Crypto Gems Attract Analyst Attention Meme coins are constructed on hype on the internet. But now, experts think low-cap projects that actually address real-life issues will make the biggest profits. Pepe Coin has brand power, and Troll (SOL) has timing—but both are sentiment and speculation-driven. Investors looking for the next 100x crypto are gravitating toward crypto that has actual utility and low gas fee crypto alternatives. And that's where an underdog challenger enters the picture. Hello Remittix: A Utility‑Driven Player in the Cryptosphere Remittix (RTX) is causing a buzz with its price of just $0.0895 per token , having sold over 579 million tokens and raising $18 million. There is still a 50% bonus available in its ongoing presale. The Remittix Wallet—which is coming in Q3 2025—will enable crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, supporting 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. It boasts real-time FX conversion, low gas fees, and mobile-first UX optimized for international consumers like freelancers, expats, and small businesses. Why Remittix Can Be the Real Winner Among Low-Caps Utility-first approach: Serves global payment inefficiencies Presale traction: $18 Million+ raised, 579Million+ tokens sold Beta wallet on the horizon: Launches Q3 2025 Big bonus: 50% extra tokens for early adopters $250,000 giveaway: Offers extra incentive for new users With real tech behind it and real use cases driving it, Remittix is being seen as the best crypto presale 2025. It's not here to win the meme war—it's here to win crypto's next utility race. Pepe Coin could easily go to a $50 billion market cap, and Troll (SOL) could have some additional waves. But it's initiatives like Remittix that bring value—and that is what experts hold drives sustainable 100x growth.

2025-08-03 18:14:02,49478426,1754244842,Market Trends: Decline in Solana's Value and Rising Interest in Remittix,"Recent market trends have shown a stark decline in the value of Solana (SOL), once a high-flying cryptocurrency. Analysts predict further reductions in its price come August. In contrast, the PayFi sector, led by innovations like Remittix (RTX), is experiencing a surge in investor interest due to its practical utility in real-world financial transactions. Solana's decline from over $200 to fluctuating prices around $160 has incited a broader conversation about the sustainability of certain cryptocurrencies under market pressures. The sharp downturn of Solana's valuation, despite reaching a high of $205, has led to heightened caution among investors and a pivot towards alternatives that offer more than speculative value. The Appeal of Remittix as a PayFi Solution In the wake of Solana's fluctuating market performance, traders and investors are increasingly turning their attention to Remittix , a platform that promises to seamlessly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency. This utility is particularly appealing in an environment where many are looking for stability and real-world application. Remittix's approach to PayFi, which facilitates instant liquidity of digital assets, is drawing significant interest. This is evident from the platform's rapid growth and the traction it's gaining amidst the current market volatility. Technical Analysis and Market Predictions for Solana The technical analysis for Solana shows a bearish trend with key indicators like the RSI and MACD reflecting a potential further drop. Market experts suggest that if Solana breaks below the $160 support level, it could see prices as low as $150 in the near future. This instability is prompting traders to diversify their portfolios, with many looking towards more secure and utility-based cryptocurrencies like RTX. The rapid pivot from hype-driven investments like meme coins to platforms that offer tangible financial solutions is reshaping investor strategies. Remittix is emblematic of this shift, with its PayFi model providing immediate crypto-to-fiat conversions without the need for traditional banking infrastructure. Future Prospects and Developments Looking ahead, Remittix is not just weathering the current crypto storm but thriving within it. With plans to launch the Remittix Wallet beta soon, the platform is setting the stage for significant growth in the PayFi domain. This positions RTX as a practical and promising investment amidst the broader crypto market's volatility. Moreover, the upcoming $250,000 Remittix Giveaway to celebrate the wallet launch underscores the platform's commitment to growing its user base and enhancing its visibility in the fintech sector.

2025-08-03 18:13:17,49478174,1754244797,"Market Analysts Warn Of Further Solana (SOL) Slump In August, Prompting Traders To Reposition In Remittix (RTX)","Solana’s sharp reversal has spooked the market. After peaking above $200, Solana Price is now slipping fast, with analysts warning of more downside in August. Meanwhile, traders aren’t waiting around. Many are already rotating into Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi crypto offering real-world utility. With SOL stalling, RTX is gaining attention as the smarter, safer play in an increasingly shaky altcoin environment. Solana Price Crashes Below $170 After Sharp Weekly Drop Solana’s bullish momentum has taken a sharp turn. After briefly crossing $205 in late July, the SOL Price has now dropped over 20%, sitting closer to $160. The pullback isn’t surprising given the overheated rally, but the sudden reversal has sparked concern among investors. The Solana Price today reflects growing caution, especially with Bitcoin dominance rising and altcoin strength fading. The Solana Price Prediction for August now leans bearish, with technicals showing declining RSI and a MACD that just flipped downward. Traders have noted SOL Price is struggling to hold above the $160 support. If it breaks, analysts say a slide toward $150 isn’t off the table. The SOL News cycle has also shifted focus—from meme coin hype to broader ecosystem development. That pivot may be good long-term, but in the short run, it’s left Solana exposed. Platforms like pump.fun aren’t pulling as much retail activity, and newer Layer 2 chains like Base are stealing the spotlight. Despite maintaining solid daily active address counts, the Solana Price has suffered from fading momentum and profit-taking pressure. Many traders are now diversifying into alternatives. Remittix (RTX), for example, has quietly attracted serious capital thanks to its PayFi focus and crypto-to-fiat utility. Compared to Solana News driven by speculation, Remittix offers something grounded—and it’s gaining traction quickly. Remittix Emerges As Top Pick Amid Solana Price Decline While Solana news shows growing weakness, a different project is quietly winning trader confidence. Remittix (RTX) has stepped into the spotlight as a more grounded bet—especially with SOL losing momentum and slipping below key levels. Rather than depending on hype, Remittix delivers what many in crypto talk about but rarely offer: real utility. Its PayFi model turns crypto into spendable fiat in seconds. No centralized exchanges. No long wait times. Just direct, usable money. While traders worry about the SOL Price Prediction in August, Remittix is pushing forward. It’s already raised over $18 million, sold more than 579 million tokens, and now gears up for its biggest product milestone yet—the Remittix Wallet beta on September 15. Remittix investors now enjoy: A working PayFi system designed for real-world crypto-to-fiat usage Growing support from analysts who favor utility over volatility Stable demand while meme coins and large caps dip Access to the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway during wallet launch rollout Remittix isn’t fighting the trend—it’s redefining it.

2025-08-03 18:11:46,49478397,1754244706,Exploring the Rise of Remittix Amidst the Decline of Cardano and Shiba Inu,"Recent Struggles in the Cryptocurrency Market The digital currency landscape has seen dramatic shifts, with established players like Cardano and Shiba Inu experiencing notable declines. Cardano, after achieving a July peak, saw a sharp 15% drop in value, negating significant gains from earlier in the year. Similarly, Shiba Inu's price plummeted, erasing a substantial portion of its recent rally. This downturn in both assets highlights the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency markets and investor sentiment influenced by broader economic events and internal ecosystem changes. The Emergence of Remittix In contrast to the struggles faced by Cardano and Shiba Inu, Remittix is gaining traction as a robust contender in the blockchain space. With a focus on creating a seamless PayFi ecosystem that facilitates instant crypto-to-bank transfers, Remittix addresses the inefficiencies plaguing the $190 trillion cross-border payments market. This innovative platform is not just a concept but a rapidly developing project aiming for a Q3 2025 wallet beta launch. Remittix is designed to integrate over 40 cryptocurrencies, facilitating real-time fiat settlements, which is a significant step forward in merging crypto economies with traditional financial systems. Technical Challenges and Market Responses While Remittix is on the rise, the technical indicators for Cardano and Shiba Inu show potential further declines. Cardano's active addresses have decreased, reaching a low not seen since November 2024, which could indicate a reducing user base or waning interest. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, despite a significant token burn, has not seen a corresponding uplift in price, suggesting that market sentiment remains bearish. Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Remittix is poised to redefine the standards for financial transactions across borders. By enabling crypto-to-bank transfers in seconds and supporting multi-chain functionality, Remittix promises low transaction costs and high efficiency, making it an attractive option for both businesses and individual users. Moreover, the platform's strategic initiatives, such as the $250,000 community giveaway, aim to bolster early adoption and create a robust user base ahead of its official launch. Join the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway As the crypto market continues to evolve, Remittix provides a compelling investment opportunity, especially considering the potential downturns facing more established cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Shiba Inu.

2025-08-03 18:11:09,49478092,1754244669,"Cardano and Shiba Inu Erase July Gains, But This Viral Crypto Looks Set To Extend 500% Gains","Cardano (ADA) has fallen 15% from its July peak of $0.92 to $0.69, erasing a 53% rally sparked by the Chang Hard Fork and governance upgrades. Shiba Inu (SHIB) followed suit, wiping out more than half of its July gains. As these top altcoins struggle to regain footing, smart money investors are eyeing a new 100x crypto candidate with real-world use cases and sustained momentum. Which new crypto token launch is analysts’ top pick for best crypto investment in 2025? Let’s find out. Cardano’s Technical Breakdown Signals Deeper Correction Despite major upgrades, Cardano has broken below key $0.85 support, now trading near $0.69 with RSI at 37, indicating possible further downside. The drop comes as Cardano daily active addresses slide to 21,500, lowest since November 2024 and on the back of the market pullback in reaction to Trump’s new EU tariffs . Analysts are split: some see ADA rebounding if it reclaims $0.85, targeting $1.50 in a cycle similar to 2021 , while others warn of a deeper correction toward $0.70 or even $0.65. Cardano’s rigorous development model has yielded over 1,300 projects and $412M in Total Value Locked, but slower adoption and user experience challenges leave it lagging behind newer, more agile competitors . Shiba Inu Supply Faces Inflation Amidst Burn Rate Decline SHIB has tumbled 16% from July highs despite a one-day burn of 600M tokens, a 374,629% spike. Yet price performance remains disconnected from burn activity. Technicals show weakness: SHIB has dropped below its 50-day EMA, with RSI below 50 and falling volumes. While SHIB celebrates 5 years and 21,600,000% historical gains, reduced Shibarium usage and waning open interest suggest fading momentum and Shib Inu price may fall toward $0.0000094 if selling continues. Remittix: Extending 500% Growth Through Real-World Utility As ADA and Shiba Inu prices retrace, Remittix's mission to bank every individual is gaining steam. The top DeFi company is building a PayFi ecosystem to enable instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, directly solving inefficiencies in the $190 Trillion cross-border payments market. Set for a Q3 2025 wallet beta launch, RTX combines real-world utility with strong tokenomics. Its multi-chain Pay API lets businesses accept 40+ cryptos while settling in fiat instantly, addressing true market demand without relying on hype or token burns alone. Key Remittix Features Capturing Whale Interest Enterprise Pay API: Accept 40+ cryptos, get fiat instantly with compliance and treasury tools. Real-Time Settlement: Crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries in seconds. Mobile Wallet Launch (Q3 2025): Real-time FX conversion for global users. Low Gas Fees: Multi-chain support for Ethereum, Solana, and others.

Participants earn RTX through referrals, content creation, and engagement, while ADA and SHIB face bearish pressure.

2025-08-03 18:09:56,49478276,1754244596,Exploring Cryptocurrency Investments in 2025: Dogecoin Vs. Remittix,"With the cryptocurrency market experiencing a rollercoaster ride in recent years, attention has shifted towards how different cryptocurrencies have adapted and performed. In 2025, the spotlight shines on Dogecoin for its resilience and on Remittix, a new player making notable strides. The Current State of Dogecoin Dogecoin recently saw a decline of approximately 8%, with its trading price hovering near $0.1958. Nevertheless, it maintains a place within a longstanding ascending channel established since 2014. This channel's historical reliability suggests potential for recovery. Recent analysis by Analyst Tardigrade suggests a potential uptick to $0.265 if current patterns hold, with significant buying noted among institutional wallets. Why Remittix Stands Out in 2025 Unlike Dogecoin, Remittix offers a stark contrast with its innovative approach, connecting cryptocurrencies directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. By targeting practical financial solutions with a focus on cross-border payments and a secure infrastructure, Remittix has quickly become the preferred choice for those seeking efficient and reliable crypto solutions. Comparative Analysis and Final Thoughts While Dogecoin continues to appeal due to its community and speculative potential, Remittix's directed approach towards utility in finance positions it as a formidable entity in the crypto space. The choice between the two depends largely on investment goals—whether one values the potential for quick financial returns or believes in long-term utility and stability.

2025-08-03 18:09:08,49478022,1754244548,Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Still A Good Buy In 2025? Analysts Prefer This Altcoin After Defying Crypto Market Crash,"Dogecoin is back in the spotlight in 2025, but not for the usual reasons. While many tokens dropped hard during the recent crypto market downturn, Remittix (RTX) has gained investor attention after defying the selloff. RTX is quickly becoming a favorite among early buyers. Dogecoin Updates: Still Holding Its Ground? Dogecoin (DOGE) just slipped by 8%, now trading near $0.1958, with a 17% loss recorded over the past week. Despite this, traders are still hopeful. In fact, many are watching closely. Dogecoin updates from key analysts show that DOGE still trades inside a long-term ascending channel that dates back to 2014. This channel has served as strong support in past cycles. Analyst Tardigrade recently shared a chart showing that DOGE is once again near the bottom of this channel. Ali Martinez added that a falling wedge pattern is forming on the 1-hour chart, which could break out to $0.265 if bulls regain momentum. Key support sits at $0.215–$0.210, with upside resistance around $0.230. source: @ali_charts on X Adding to the bullish case, whales are buying the dip. Over 310 million DOGE has been scooped up by institutional wallets in recent weeks. Bit Origin also bought 40 million DOGE as part of a $500 million diversification move. Why Analysts Prefer Remittix (RTX) Over DOGE in 2025 While Dogecoin updates offer mixed signals, Remittix is delivering steady performance and growing hype. Designed to connect crypto directly to bank accounts across 30+ countries, Remittix stands out as a crypto with real utility . So far, it has raised over $18 million and is offering a 50% bonus to early participants. At just $0.0895 per token, it’s still in its early phase, and many investors believe it could be the best crypto to buy now. Here is what makes Remittix different: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries Wallet launching in Q3 2025 with real-time FX conversion Audited by CertiK for safety and transparency 20% referral rewards for users who bring in others Support for 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies Traders are calling Remittix the ""next XRP"" because of its cross-border payment focus and global adoption potential. Unlike Dogecoin, RTX is building infrastructure with real-world impact. Final Verdict: Is DOGE Still A Good Buy? Yes, Dogecoin is still a good buy for those betting on history repeating itself. It has survived many crashes and still attracts attention from whales. But for those looking for faster gains and real-world utility, Remittix is the rising pick. It is solving real problems, attracting serious capital, and could easily lead the next wave of adoption.

2025-08-03 18:04:26,49478396,1754244266,"Wall Street braces for packed week of Fed talks, key data, and 120 S&P earnings","Wall Street has no breathing room this week as August kicks off with a flood of economic data, high-stakes Fed talk, and earnings reports from more than a hundred S&P 500 companies. This week’s calendar includes PMI prints, a bond auction, weekly labor figures, and speeches from five Federal Reserve officials; all stacked up in the same four-day stretch. And just as traders start unpacking that, names like Pfizer, AMD, Disney, and Eli Lilly are scheduled to drop their latest numbers. The madness begins Monday with July’s S&P Global Services PMI, followed by the ISM’s Non-Manufacturing PMI on Tuesday. Those reports will give a real-time look into whether the service side of the U.S. economy is still running hot. On Wednesday, the Treasury is auctioning 10-year notes, which will test demand for long-term debt. Thursday closes out the macro data cycle with the weekly jobless claims report, a key signal for how strong the labor market still is. Meanwhile, Fed officials will speak five separate times this week. That’s five different chances for them to either calm or spook investors with comments on inflation, rate cuts, or anything else markets aren’t prepared to hear. Earnings from 120 S&P 500 firms, including Pfizer, AMD, and Disney Roughly 120 companies in the S&P 500 will publish quarterly earnings in the days ahead, with Pfizer, AMD, Disney, Super Micro Computer, and Eli Lilly among the most watched. This comes after major names like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta released their reports last week. So far, two-thirds of the index has reported, with over 82% beating expectations, according to data from FactSet. Pfizer will post results before Tuesday’s opening bell, followed by an earnings call at 10 a.m. Last quarter, the company beat estimates while trimming costs. This quarter, analysts at LSEG expect a small drop in year-over-year profit. Investors are watching how Donald Trump’s effort to cut drug prices might weigh on future earnings. Bank of America’s Tim Anderson said the call will likely mention “RFK Jr and possible risks to vaccines; [and] obesity franchise aspirations and/or other early pipeline opportunities like PFE’s next-gen PCV vaccines.” Historically, Pfizer has topped earnings expectations 87% of the time, based on data from Bespoke Investment Group. Advanced Micro Devices reports Tuesday after market close, with its call set for 5 p.m. Last quarter, AMD posted solid earnings but warned about a $1.5 billion revenue loss tied to U.S. limits on chip sales to China. This time, LSEG’s analysts see profit dropping nearly 30% year-over-year, while revenue could climb over 25%. Super Micro Computer will also report earnings after Tuesday’s close, with a conference call scheduled for 5 p.m. Last quarter, the company issued weak guidance and pointed to economic uncertainty and tariff risks. LSEG data suggests this quarter could bring a steep decline in earnings. JPMorgan’s Samik Chatterjee put the company on “negative catalyst watch,” citing tight margins and rising competition. He said those two factors “drive downside to the premium valuation multiple SMCI shares are currently trading at.” Super Micro only beats estimates 64% of the time, but on average, the stock gains 2.3% when it releases earnings. Disney and Eli Lilly will test investor nerves midweek Disney is scheduled to report on Wednesday morning with an 8:30 a.m. earnings call. Last quarter, the company surprised analysts with stronger-than-expected growth in its streaming business. LSEG projects a 7% year-over-year rise in profit this time, but shares are under pressure. Disney stock has dropped more than 5% in the past month, even as the S&P 500 edged higher. Bespoke data shows Disney has beaten expectations in seven of its last eight quarters. Eli Lilly will publish earnings early Thursday, with a call at 8:30 a.m. The company posted a 45% jump in sales last quarter, fueled by demand for its obesity treatment Mounjaro. Analysts at LSEG expect 40% growth this time. Traders will want to hear updates on Mounjaro, especially after Lilly said it matched the heart health benefits of its diabetes drug Trulicity in a recent head-to-head trial. Lilly usually beats forecasts, 66% of the time, but its stock rarely benefits on earnings day. On average, it drops 0.2%.

2025-08-03 18:03:32,49477722,1754244212,2018 Market Ranking Table Shocks XRP Army: This Could Happen Again,"An old ranking chart from 2018 resurfaced this week, bringing renewed energy to the XRP community. The image, shared by crypto influencer XRP Avenger (@XRP_Avengers), shows XRP at the top of the leaderboard with a valuation surpassing Bitcoin. It lists XRP at $2.38 with a market cap of over $238 billion. However, that figure reflects its fully diluted valuation (FDV), not its true circulating market cap at the time. XRP Avenger called on the community to watch XRP, as he expects the asset to surpass Bitcoin’s market cap and not just its FDV this time. While some dismissed the table as a relic of crypto history, others believe XRP can achieve this feat and see the chart as a reminder of the digital asset’s potential to disrupt the current market structure. Here is #XRP back in 2018 This could happen again You have been warned, All eyes on $XRP .. pic.twitter.com/PM3cLE1Di4 — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) August 3, 2025 Bitcoin remained dominant in 2018 and has remained the largest asset in the market since then, but the chart shows a brief point in history when XRP’s FDV briefly overtook both Bitcoin and Ethereum. That moment marked a psychological turning point for the XRP community and planted a vision that persists today of XRP leading the crypto market in both adoption and valuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From FDV to Real Market Cap In March 2025, XRP shocked the crypto market again, surpassing Ethereum’s FDV. The asset’s FDV crossed $200 million for the first time since 2018 in late 2024, and its spectacular surge between then and early 2025 helped it surpass ETH in this key valuation . Analysts and supporters pointed to this achievement as further validation of XRP’s trajectory. However, the focus has shifted beyond FDV. What the XRP community is calling for now is real growth in the asset’s actual market cap. Notably, XRP was the second-largest in the crypto market in 2014 , and briefly in 2018 when it rose to its previous all-time high. Because it has surpassed Ethereum in the past, experts are confident that the asset can do it again . However, Bitcoin is a much harder challenge. Can XRP Overtake Bitcoin? Bitcoin currently holds a market cap of $2.39 trillion. With XRP’s circulating supply sitting at 59.3 billion tokens, matching Bitcoin’s market cap would require a price of over $40.3 per XRP. That is almost a 15x increase from XRP’s current trading levels, but it’s not unheard of in the context of cryptocurrency cycles. Analysts have also set targets far above $40 for the current cycle, and if XRP can match their expectations, it could become the largest asset in the crypto market.

2025-08-03 18:01:53,49477678,1754244113,Kraken Revenue Soars Year-Over-Year – But EBITDA Takes a Hit,"Kraken reported $412 million in revenue for Q2 2025. This represented an 18% increase year-over-year but a decline of 13% quarter-over-quarter, for the crypto exchange Adjusted EBITDA, however, plunged by 7% during the same period and reached $79.7 million from $85.5 million. Seasonal Weakness Total exchange volume rose 19% year-over-year to $186.8 billion, though activity slowed quarter-over-quarter amid market turbulence tied to US tariffs and broader macroeconomic uncertainties. Kraken noted that Q2 is typically a seasonally weaker period for trading across the industry. The exchange’s funded accounts grew 37% from a year earlier to 4.4 million, while assets on the platform rose 47% year-over-year to $43.2 billion. Kraken also revealed expanding its market share in spot trading, which was supported by ongoing product improvements. In fact, the company saw strong momentum in stablecoin-related trading, as its share of stable-fiat spot volumes climbed from 43% to 68% over the quarter. Kraken has announced a series of product expansions targeting both retail and institutional users. In Europe, the company launched what it describes as the region’s largest MiFID-regulated crypto futures suite, including 24/7 FX perpetual futures for EUR, GBP, AUD, JPY, and CHF trading pairs on Kraken Pro. In the United States, the platform introduced a regulated derivatives offering to allow users to access CME-listed crypto futures through its integrated platform. For institutional clients, the company debuted Kraken Prime, a brokerage service that combined trade execution, custody, and liquidity. The crypto exchange also expanded its custody business by adding support for Solana (SOL), XRP, and reward-bearing USDG, to target high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients seeking secure asset storage and staking solutions. Co-Founder Cleared by DOJ Amid these operational milestones, the company saw a separate legal issue concerning its former CEO reach a conclusion. The US Department of Justice recently closed its investigation into Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell, which stemmed from allegations unrelated to crypto. The probe focused on a governance dispute involving Verge Center for the Arts, a nonprofit Powell founded. He was accused of hacking accounts and blocking access. The FBI raided Powell’s home in 2023 and seized devices that have now been returned. Prosecutors informed Powell’s team in April that no charges would be filed. The founder called the raid “devastating” and plans civil action against Verge’s board. The decision comes as Kraken eyes a potential IPO in 2026. Powell remains on the company’s board after stepping down as CEO.

No additional apps, no clutter, and most importantly, no waiting for withdrawals. Every win can be cashed out instantly to the user’s wallet, regardless of bet size or sport. If you want a unified crypto platform where high-speed sports betting is combined with instant withdrawals and data-backed odds, Spartans is the frontrunner in 2025. 2. Stake.com: Reliable Markets, Moderate Payout Delays Stake.com continues to be a recognizable force in crypto betting. With expansive coverage across football, MMA, tennis, and digital events, it remains a strong option for variety. The interface is sleek and easy to use, and frequent promotions keep players engaged. That said, its position among the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms is affected by slower withdrawal times. Players dealing with higher-value wins often experience manual processing and payout delays. For crypto users who expect instant access to funds after a match or parlay, this creates a noticeable speed gap. Stake still delivers quality overall, but players seeking real-time payout precision may find faster alternatives. 3. Bet365: Unmatched Coverage, But Crypto Still Lags Bet365 offers arguably the widest selection of markets on the planet, from Champions League and NFL to less mainstream sports like table tennis or Gaelic football. It’s long been a trusted name in betting, and its platform remains user-friendly and detailed. But in 2025, speed is everything, and Bet365’s crypto integration hasn’t caught up. Though Bitcoin support exists in select regions, withdrawals often involve third-party processors or fiat conversion layers. That can slow down multi-sport cashouts and disrupt users moving between markets throughout the day. Bet365 still has massive value in terms of coverage, but it ranks lower on the list of top multi-sport crypto betting platforms due to its legacy infrastructure. 4. Betano: Good Selection, Slower Crypto Flow Betano is known for strong regional offerings, especially in Latin America and Europe. It covers football, basketball, and even niche local sports, making it appealing to diverse users. Live odds are generally responsive, and event streaming is well-integrated into the interface. But crypto users will notice a few speed bumps. Betano’s wallet structure relies on traditional payment back-ends, even when crypto is used for deposits. Withdrawals, especially larger ones, often pass through verification gates and delay what would otherwise be a smooth experience. Among the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms, Betano is solid in content but less optimized for crypto-native betting agility. 5. BC.Game: Crypto Flexibility, Clunky Navigation BC.Game offers a high degree of flexibility in accepted cryptocurrencies, well over 50 coins and tokens are supported. It’s community-oriented, with chatrooms and giveaways that make it feel more interactive than the average sportsbook. However, its sportsbook design is not as clean or intuitive when switching between multiple live events. While betting options span across sports, navigation during live events can be disorganized. Real-time data displays are limited, and the interface sometimes struggles to keep pace with fast in-play decisions. BC.Game is certainly a contender in crypto access, but to compete as one of the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms, it will need to upgrade both interface fluidity and event-switching mechanics. 6. BetMGM: Mainstream Strength, Crypto Shortcomings BetMGM is a powerhouse in the U.S. market, with strong coverage in NFL, NBA, and MLB, plus growing support for international events. Its mobile platform is among the best in traditional sports betting, and its brand reputation is solid. Crypto functionality, however, is still emerging. Most users will be prompted to convert crypto to fiat to withdraw, which introduces both time and fee overhead. For those who value speed across sports bets placed in quick succession, this isn’t ideal. BetMGM ranks among the more established names in this space, but among the top multi-sport crypto betting platforms, its current crypto limitations hold it back. Final Word: Speed and Integration Define the Winners The betting scene in 2025 isn’t just about game availability; it’s about delivering fast, flexible, and crypto-native performance across multiple sports in one unified environment. Spartans leads the field by combining instant payouts, seamless in-play betting, and reliable crypto wallet integration in a way that rivals just haven’t matched. Stake.com and Bet365 provide excellent market coverage but struggle with real-time withdrawals. Betano, BC.Game, and BetMGM bring some useful features but fall short on the integration needed for fluid multi-sport crypto betting. For those ready to level up their crypto sports experience, Spartans stands as the clearest and most complete choice among all top multi-sport crypto betting platforms in 2025.

2025-08-03 18:00:11,49477671,1754244011,"How Spartans Beats FanDuel and Betway With 5,963 Games in 2025","Why Experts Predict Spartans Will Surpass Betway & FanDuel: Data-backed Insights Unveiled As the competition intensifies in the 2025 betting space, platforms like FanDuel and Betway are leaning into regional media alliances and cultural campaigns to solidify their user base. FanDuel Sports Network has achieved a 25% boost in ad impressions through its streaming-first approach. Meanwhile, Betway has doubled down on South African cricket by extending a key sponsorship deal and supporting a player auction backed by R131 million. While these platforms emphasize attention and visibility, Spartans is focusing on sheer scale, providing 5,963 betting options, fast crypto withdrawals, and a sportsbook that includes every significant league. For those evaluating platforms based on depth and utility rather than marketing, Spartans is starting to set the pace. Spartans: 5,963 Games, Crypto Speed, and Complete Sportsbook Access Instead of banking on broadcasting deals or live events, Spartans is structured to meet the needs of bettors directly. The platform includes 5,963 games, a complete sportsbook interface, and instant withdrawals in digital currencies, offering everything modern players prioritize: flexibility, speed, and direct access. With Spartans, users can transact instantly through BTC, BNB, DAI, USDC, ETH, USDT, and ADA. There are no regional limitations or surprise ID checks. Whether betting on MMA events or engaging in roulette, the flow remains smooth and user-friendly. The welcome offer is a 300% bonus with clear terms: 35x wagering requirement, 7-day window, and specified withdrawal caps, ensuring transparency from the start. This level of openness remains uncommon among larger brands. Spartans’ sportsbook spans international leagues in soccer, basketball, MMA, and more, all accessible via a mobile-optimized interface that works without requiring an app. While others focus on aggressive marketing or brand recognition, Spartans is assembling a reliable, crypto-based system, many are calling the most dependable crypto betting platform available, streamlined, secure, and straightforward. FanDuel: Strong on Streaming, Limited by Location FanDuel’s strategy revolves around expanding its media influence. In 2025, it collaborated with Magnite’s SpringServe to enhance ad delivery, resulting in a 25% rise in ad reach across its 15 owned sports networks. With over 3,000 NBA, NHL, and MLB games streamed, it is slowly blending media and betting. Users can engage with live betting, explore fantasy teams, and purchase merchandise within one hub. Still, its primary edge, its content network, is closely tied to U.S. licenses. FanDuel’s crypto features are limited, withdrawal timelines are average, and bonus clarity shifts depending on the region. As betting leans toward unrestricted access and fast settlements, FanDuel’s regional media-centric model might fall short for those outside its primary coverage zones. The user interface is refined, but remains geographically bound. Betway: Energized by Local Presence, Hindered by Scaling Limits Betway’s focus this year is local strength. Renewing its collaboration with Switch Energy Drink for SA20 Season 4, Betway is intensifying its role in South Africa’s cricket scene. The 34-day event features big giveaways and stadium activations aimed at amplifying fan engagement. Its upcoming player auction on September 9 features a budget cap of R131 million (nearly $7 million USD), reinforcing Betway’s local branding strategy. This approach builds momentum from national pride and cultural involvement. However, Betway remains anchored to older betting structures. Its focus is on fiat transactions, region-specific rollouts, and variable promotions. Bonus terms are inconsistent, and withdrawal times differ widely. Though its on-ground visibility is high, it lacks global scalability or crypto-first features, two things increasingly demanded by newer users. Final Words! FanDuel’s extensive game streams and Betway’s regional sponsorships are focused on impact and audience pull. FanDuel’s 3,000-game broadcast strategy and Betway’s cricket investment aim for short-term dominance. But such efforts often lack lasting value. Spartans is built differently. Nearly 6,000 games, instant crypto features, and a borderless sportsbook show it’s built for continuous user benefit, not fleeting promotions. The 300% bonus is straightforward, not layered with hard-to-understand conditions. The real challenge in the sportsbook race lies in consistent delivery, not eye-catching campaigns. Spartans is leading in exactly that, functionality, fairness, and fast execution. This isn’t a long-shot contender; it’s already proving to be a platform with serious potential.

2025-08-03 07:58:26,49457460,1754207906,Analyst: I Repeat- $6-$8 XRP Price In August Highly Likely,"While XRP has faced pressure in recent sessions, a new analysis suggests that the current correction could be nearing completion. In a chart posted on August 2, trader and crypto analyst Xoom (@Mr_Xoom) outlined a potential bullish reversal zone as XRP trades around the $2.93 mark. The chart indicates a classic five-wave Elliott Wave pattern , where wave 5 is projected to finalize around $2.8. The chart highlights a series of lower highs and lower lows from late July into early August. After completing Waves 1 to 5, the chart outlines the potential endpoint, which falls around the $2.8 zone that Xoom previously set as the XRP’s lowest point for this cycle. XRP Ltf wave 5 coming to an end. I repeat- $6-$8 XRP in August highly likely. https://t.co/whkoyP1vM5 pic.twitter.com/2lPXPs5ybR — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 2, 2025 Support Zone Under Scrutiny XRP recently experienced a notable decline, falling below the crucial $3 support zone . It has failed to reclaim this level, causing some concern among market participants. Xoom outlined this level on the chart, as it held up XRP in July after the asset retraced from its all-time high . Although XRP has broken through this support, Xoom is confident in the technical structure and anticipates a recovery. Despite the recent decline, XRP has remained above the highlighted support at $2.8, and the current forecast implies that once wave 5 concludes, a larger reversal could follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bearish Momentum is Slowing Down Elliott Wave theory, the analytical framework used in the chart, typically identifies patterns of investor behavior. A completed five-wave downtrend often precedes a corrective rally or a new impulsive move in the opposite direction. In this case, Xoom appears to anticipate the latter, which would imply a significant upside breakout if the projected reversal plays out. At the time of Xoom’s analysis, XRP sat slightly above the $2.8 support, trading around $2.93. The bearish sequence, while still active, appears to be losing momentum, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Outlook for August Remains Bullish Despite the short-term bearish structure, the forecast remains optimistic over the coming weeks. Xoom reiterated his previous target, stating that XRP reaching $6 to $8 in August is highly likely . The projected target range represents a more than 2x increase from current levels at the minimum. While that may seem ambitious, the underlying structure of the wave analysis supports the case for a trend shift if the $2.80 support holds firm.

The company aims to use the funds raised through the capital increase, totaling up to 555 billion yen (approximately $3.8 billion), to purchase Bitcoin. According to the announcement, Class A shares will be “senior and non-convertible,” while Class B shares will be “convertible,” and both classes will fall under the perpetual preferred share category. Metaplanet has also filed a registration application with the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA) to facilitate the issuance of these shares.

2025-08-03 07:36:55,49457459,1754206615,SBI Holdings Releases Infographic about Total XRP Circulation,"XRP community figure WrathofKahneman recently shared an updated infographic from SBI Holdings’ fiscal year-end report that details the current distribution of XRP as of July 20, 2025. The image, described as one of the most comprehensive and clear visualizations of XRP’s total supply, reiterates the essential breakdown of XRP holdings, including those in escrow, in active circulation, and under Ripple’s control. The data visualization provides insight into how XRP is distributed across different categories, emphasizing the constraints on Ripple’s ability to liquidate large portions of the asset. Still the best infographic about total #XRP circulation, updated. (SBI Holdings fiscal year end report) ~36b left in escrow.. pic.twitter.com/GniV4tFO3P — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 1, 2025 XRP Market Circulation and Total Supply The maximum supply of XRP remains capped at 100 billion tokens. According to the infographic, approximately 59.24 billion XRP are in active circulation within the market. At the time of reporting, this portion of XRP carries a market capitalization of approximately 28.6 trillion Japanese yen, based on pricing data from July 28. This figure reflects a substantial segment of the total supply and constitutes the portion that is freely tradable across exchanges and platforms. Ripple’s Non-Circulating Holdings As of the end of March 2025, Ripple held a significant volume of XRP that had not entered the market. These holdings are categorized as being outside of current market circulation and are valued at approximately 13.4 trillion yen. By July 20, 2025, the infographic reports that Ripple’s non-circulating holdings are equivalent to 19.7 trillion yen, which suggests that the valuation is based on a revised XRP price as of July 28. These tokens represent a portion of the supply Ripple retains direct control over, yet has not introduced into active trading markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Under Escrow and Burned Supply A prominent feature of the report is the quantification of XRP held under escrow . Roughly 35.9 billion XRP remain locked under the escrow mechanism. The infographic explains that XRP placed in escrow on the XRP Ledger is restricted from use or destruction until specific conditions are met. The escrow system was established to promote predictability and ensure responsible token release over time. Based on ledger data available as of July 20, 2025, the report confirms that nearly 40% of the total XRP supply is still under escrow, and thus, Ripple is not at liberty to sell or distribute these tokens at will. In addition to circulating and escrowed tokens, the infographic indicates that approximately 10 million XRP have been permanently removed from the total supply through transaction fees. These burned tokens represent a fraction of the total but reflect the deflationary nature of the transaction cost model built into the XRP Ledger. Summary of Data Presentation and Source The quantities shown in the infographic are derived from XRP Ledger data as of July 20, 2025, and the monetary valuations are calculated using XRP’s market price as of July 28. WrathofKahneman referred to the updated image as “still the best infographic about total XRP circulation,” highlighting its clarity and the credibility of its source, which is SBI Holdings. The visual report illustrates the current landscape of XRP distribution in quantifiable detail and offers transparency on Ripple’s available and restricted holdings.

2025-08-03 07:19:07,49457457,1754205547,BlackRock and Ripple Are Acting In Sync Quietly but on a Massive Scale,"Crypto enthusiast Cosmos has presented a detailed analysis asserting that Ripple and BlackRock are acting in coordination to reshape the financial system through tokenization. According to Cosmo, both entities are quietly aligning operations, timelines, and personnel to build a tokenized infrastructure that affects not just financial instruments, but also identity, medical data, and global market architecture. The claims, supported by multiple references to known partnerships and developments, attempt to demonstrate a systemic realignment of the digital asset space led by Ripple and BlackRock. Cosmo opens the thread by stating that BlackRock and Ripple have “just been exposed,” and suggests they are using tokenization as a vehicle to control financial markets. The tweet asserts that the same assets are being targeted, within the same timeframe, and involving the same key players behind both initiatives. The central argument is that this coordinated effort is being largely overlooked despite its significant implications for crypto holders and the broader financial ecosystem. Ripple’s Role in Tokenizing Traditional Assets Cosmo traces the beginning of this effort to Ripple’s early work in tokenizing U.S. Treasury bonds using the XRP Ledger . This was done through the OUSG fund, which is accessible in tokenized form on-chain 24/7. According to Cosmo, this marks a fundamental shift in how traditional securities are accessed and transferred. He further notes that BlackRock has allocated capital into this very fund, highlighting their indirect participation in the XRPL tokenization effort . 1^ ✰ BlackRock and Ripple are acting in sync – quietly but on a massive scale ✰ They are launching tokenization to rewrite the financial system ✰ Same assets – same timeline – same people – and no one is asking questions pic.twitter.com/OqcdS41fhA — Cosmo (@0xcosmobtc) July 31, 2025 Ondo Finance is identified as the intermediary platform responsible for launching the OUSG token. Cosmo describes Ondo as a fintech project led by former Goldman Sachs executives. The role breakdown, as Cosmo explains, places Ripple as the provider of the blockchain infrastructure, Ondo as the issuer of the tokenized instruments, and BlackRock as the source of capital liquidity. He also notes that Ripple’s legal clarity following its partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 was a strategic milestone that enabled this expansion into institutional partnerships. New Developments Involving Bio-Identification and the XRP Ledger A point of coincidence emphasized by Cosmo is the ticker symbol $XDNA. BlackRock currently has a genetics ETF trading under this ticker. Meanwhile, on July 4, 2025, a token with the same ticker, $XDNA, is set to launch on the XRP Ledger. Cosmo states that this new token is being issued by DNA Protocol and is centered on biometric identity infrastructure, medical data access, and genomics, rather than trading. He states that the XRPL will serve as the foundational blockchain for this infrastructure, further demonstrating Ripple’s reach into areas beyond finance. This development, according to Cosmo, represents the convergence of healthcare data, biometric identification, and tokenized infrastructure within a single blockchain environment. He notes that this should not be viewed in isolation but rather as an extension of Ripple’s broader role in building systems for the next era of digital infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock’s Expanding Blockchain Integration Cosmo also refers to the ISO 20022 messaging standard , currently being implemented by FedWire, SWIFT, and global banks. He points out that Ripple’s systems have been compatible with ISO 20022 from inception. In contrast, BlackRock’s Aladdin software, which manages over $20 trillion in assets, is now testing blockchain networks for settlement and transaction tracking. Cosmos states that XRPL supports ISO 20022 and operates without interruption, positioning it as a viable base layer for next-generation financial systems. According to Cosmo, the two firms are dividing responsibilities across multiple verticals. Ripple is focusing on the tokenization of government bonds, central bank digital currencies, land, and carbon markets. BlackRock is focusing on tokenizing equities, U.S. treasuries, real estate, and digital identity. Cosmo interprets this as a dual effort to reboot the global financial system from the ground up, operating in unison but through separate domains. Effect on the Broader Crypto Market In the final portion of the thread, Cosmo argues that the implications of this transformation affect all crypto holders. He says that anyone holding assets like Ethereum or Solana is already part of this evolving structure, regardless of whether they are aware. Cosmo warns that the shift is not about adopting a new market, but rather transitioning the current system into a more centralized form under different management. He ends the thread with a caution that this transformation is not optional. According to his view, tokenization led by Ripple and BlackRock is already in motion, and retail participants are being absorbed into an institutional framework without a clear understanding of the broader design.

2025-08-03 07:12:20,49457384,1754205140,Dogecoin Dragged Lower by Outflows With Technicals Flagging Bearish Continuation,"Dogecoin fell 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), slipping from $0.20 to as low as $0.19 amid sharp spikes in trading activity and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins. What to Know DOGE traded in a volatile $0.01 range (7.14%) during the session, declining from $0.20 to $0.19 before staging a mild bounce. Volume surged to 918.53M at 06:00 and 502.81M at 14:00, both exceeding the 24H average of 385.67M, signaling high-conviction exits. Support formed around $0.188–$0.190, where volume spiked to 667.44M, enabling a brief recovery to $0.194. Resistance held at $0.202–$0.203, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. News Background DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets. Price Action Summary High: $0.203 Low: $0.188 Close: $0.195 24H Range: $0.015 (7.14%) Technical Analysis DOGE encountered aggressive resistance at the $0.202–$0.203 zone, rejecting multiple rallies. The $0.188–$0.190 region absorbed peak selling pressure, with high-volume prints suggesting bottom-fishing or accumulation interest. The final 60-minute session (03:55–04:54) saw a measured 0.53% drop from $0.196 to $0.195, with intra-candle resistance at $0.1963 and support near $0.1952. Volumes normalized late in the session, but remain above baseline, indicating potential for continued volatility. What Traders Are Watching Whether DOGE can hold $0.19 support or break down further amid broader altcoin weakness.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.537 (-0.5%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.55 24-hour low $0.52 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 0.537154 Price Prediction $ 0.404436 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.64% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.578797 200-Day SMA $ 0.71533 14-Day RSI 39.88 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a buying demand toward $ Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6081 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.5036 The dYdX price analysis for 3 August confirms that dYdX faced a drop as it attempted a move below $0.54. Currently, buyers are accumulating heavily, resulting in a consolidation. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price declines toward $0.54 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price attempted to maintain momentum above $0.66. As a result, buyers are now holding dYdX price around resistance lines, preparing for further upward push. The 24-hour volume surged to $5.07 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.539, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around 38, hinting that sellers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price below the EMA trend lines. Currently, sellers are holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.18, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.684049 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.670481 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.653003 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.655128 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.578797 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.613287 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.71533 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.602108 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.592156 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.589295 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.602966 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.663086 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.804666 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.024835 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6081, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6621. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5036, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4396. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers lost confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.54 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.5 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility.

As a result, dYdX recorded over 3% decline in July. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.9 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $1.2, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction August 2025 $0.45 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Houston resident Sharon Schoolcraft says she lost $13,000 after receiving a call from someone claiming to be working at Wells Fargo, reports FOX 26. Schoolcraft says the caller alerted her to possible fraudulent charges made to her account, a facade made believable by the fact that the scammer knew about recent charges she had legitimately made. The scammer subsequently told Schoolcraft that someone would come to her home to cut up or collect her cut-up Wells Fargo debit card. Similar scams have affected other Wells Fargo customers. Recent reports suggest a trend of scammers convincing the bank’s customers that their accounts are at risk, tricking them into giving up their PINs, cutting up their bank cards and then meeting someone in person to hand over the cut-up cards so the thieves can either withdraw funds or transfer money out of the accounts. In previous instances, when requesting a refund from the bank, the victims were denied by Wells Fargo. However, the bank’s decision changed when the media investigated the matter. Similarly, Wells Fargo only agreed to refund Schoolcraft her stolen $13,000 after the media got involved. Says Schoolcraft, “I’m so super stoked, it’s going to mean a lot to me. I can pay back the person I had to borrow money from. I can get my bills back on track.

The FCA had previously barred retail access to crypto ETNs in 2021, citing investor protection concerns. However, with the market maturing and some crypto investment products now better understood, the regulator said it will allow access, provided the ETNs are listed on recognized, FCA-approved U.K.-based exchanges. Products must follow financial promotion rules to prevent misleading advertising and inappropriate incentives. The FCA’s Consumer Duty rules, which require firms to avoid causing foreseeable harm, will apply. The FCA warned, however, that there won’t be coverage under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for these products.

2025-08-03 06:30:06,49457461,1754202606,Top 3 Most Undervalued Cryptocurrencies to Watch Right Now,"While Bitcoin dominates headlines, some of the most promising crypto opportunities are hiding in plain sight—trading well below their all-time highs and quietly setting up for major upside. As seasoned investors look for high-upside entry points, one fast-growing project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has caught attention for its explosive growth metrics and expanding user base. Ethereum’s Rebound Hasn’t Hit Its Ceiling Yet Ethereum (ETH) remains one of the most fundamentally sound assets in crypto, yet it’s still undervalued relative to its potential. Currently priced at $3,740, ETH is trading more than 20% below its all-time high of $4,720. Meanwhile, corporate holdings of Ethereum have surpassed $10 billion, and ETF inflows remain steady. Despite that bullish backdrop, technical momentum remains neutral, with an RSI of ~31, suggesting room for upward movement once buy-side volume picks up. A clean breakout above $4,000 could trigger rapid continuation. One New Project Is Quickly Escaping Hidden Gem Status Among altcoins seeing fast-tracked growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out of obscurity. According to on-chain metrics, MAGACOIN has recently crossed multiple internal benchmarks for user acquisition, transaction volume, and community engagement. A newly completed third-party blockchain audit has also positioned the project as a top-tier safety pick —a factor that has drawn attention from cautious but ROI-focused investors. $2,500 deployed here could turn into $50,000 , based on similar market cap trajectories seen in early-stage coins that achieved wide exchange listings. Cardano’s Discount May Not Last Long Cardano (ADA) is another altcoin hovering well below its peak, currently priced at just $0.75—a far cry from its former all-time high of $3.01. Despite recent bearish action bringing ADA down to around $0.743, RSI levels near 30.27 indicate heavy overselling. Historically, similar RSI readings have preceded major recoveries for ADA. Its strong developer activity and continued expansion into smart contracts make it a serious contender for long-term gains if it can reclaim investor confidence. Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano remain undervalued giants with significant recovery potential. But the real momentum may be forming around MAGACOIN FINANCE, now gaining recognition as one of the safest and most promising new altcoin investments . For investors hunting undervalued assets with strong growth curves, these three should be on the radar right now.

2025-08-03 06:10:09,49457381,1754201409,Trump Media Confirms $2B Bitcoin Treasury and $300M Options Strategy in Q2 2025 Earnings Report,"Trump Media and Technology Group (Nasdaq: DJT) disclosed Friday that it now holds $2 billion in bitcoin and bitcoin-related securities, officially confirming one of the largest digital asset treasuries among U.S.-listed companies. The announcement came via the company’s second quarter of 2025 earnings press release , which also mentioned $3.1 billion in total financial assets and its first-ever quarter of positive operating cash flow. The crypto holdings were first disclosed in a separate press release dated July 21. The company also said it has allocated $300 million toward an options-based strategy focused on bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets, signaling ongoing intent to expand its exposure. According to the July 21 release, this strategy could allow Trump Media to convert options into spot BTC “depending on market conditions,” and potentially use the resulting positions for revenue generation or further crypto accumulation. The $2 billion figure cited includes not only spot bitcoin but also bitcoin-related securities, such as bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bitcoin trusts, or derivatives that offer BTC exposure. These instruments allow institutional investors to gain indirect access to bitcoin price movements while avoiding direct custody or on-chain interaction. By combining these securities with spot bitcoin, Trump Media has constructed a hybrid crypto treasury intended to offer both liquidity and resilience. The second quarter also marked the company’s first quarter of positive operating cash flow, with $2.3 million generated through its media and technology operations. Total financial assets reached $3.1 billion, fueled primarily by the crypto treasury build-up and a recent private placement backed by 50 institutional investors. CEO Devin Nunes said that the liquidity and “financial freedom” afforded by this capital will help Trump Media pursue a range of product expansions, including a Truth+ streaming bundle, AI integrations, and a planned utility token for payments within the Truth Social ecosystem. The company also reiterated its goal of launching multiple crypto-focused ETFs and managed investment products.

2025-08-03 06:00:16,49457437,1754200816,"Top Cryptos to Buy Today That Are Breaking Out on Huge Volume Waves: BDAG,ETH, MATIC & AVAX!","Bitcoin has reclaimed key levels and Ethereum is climbing close to $4,000 again, sparking renewed interest across the crypto market. While these dominant names attract attention, traders are now gravitating toward newer Layer 1 projects offering better utility and growth potential. One project gaining serious traction is BlockDAG. It stands apart from typical presales by showcasing a live testnet, 2 million+ active mobile miners, and over 4,500 developers building real dApps. Currently priced at only $0.0016, BDAG promises a staggering 3,025% ROI, with early buyers already witnessing a 2,660% surge since batch 1. This price holds until August 11th, adding urgency for buyers. BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active and features a “NO VESTING PASS” offer, giving users full token access at launch. In this article, we’ll stack up Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BlockDAG to see which ones stand among the top cryptos to buy today. BlockDAG (BDAG) Few projects have managed to turn heads the way BlockDAG (BDAG) has. With presale funding exceeding $359 million and over 24.6 billion coins sold, this project is gathering steam as it nears its global rollout. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0016, which stays active until August 11th, while the official listing price remains $0.05, a setup that offers a powerful 3,025% profit window. BDAG has already delivered 2,660% gains to early supporters since batch 1. The “NO VESTING PASS” sweetens the deal, allowing holders to unlock 100% of their coins immediately upon launch. But what truly separates BlockDAG is its existing infrastructure, a fully functioning testnet, over 2 million miners using the X1 app, and 18,000+ plug-and-play X10 miners sold. With more than 300 applications already in development from 4,500+ builders, BlockDAG’s traction speaks volumes. This isn’t just an idea, it’s a full-blown, ready-to-use ecosystem, making it one of the top cryptos to buy today based on current momentum, structure, and timing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto market and continues showing strong upward signs. The recent 3% rise over 24 hours brings ETH close to the $4,000 zone. What’s fueling this? A massive $1.59 billion in ETF inflows within a week, plus heightened interest from institutions. Following a low of $3,530 in late July, ETH has surged over 61% in the past month. The reduction in exchange balances, down more than 1 million ETH in 30 days, points to reduced sell pressure. Options traders are equally optimistic, with calls far outpacing puts and target ranges between $4,000 and $6,000. While it’s a strong performer, Ethereum’s maturity could limit fast gains. For those who want explosive growth potential rather than gradual returns, newer options like BlockDAG may currently offer better upside. Still, ETH retains its place among the top cryptos to buy today for reliability and long-term value. Polygon (MATIC / POL) MATIC is staying relevant in discussions about the top cryptos to buy today. With a trading price near $0.2166 and a modest 2.6% gain, Polygon remains in motion. A notable 141% jump in USDC transfers confirms its strong presence in stablecoin and scaling infrastructure. Polygon hasn’t made headlines this week, but its zkEVM development and continuing partnerships keep the momentum alive. Current trading volume stands around $280 million, and price charts show strong consolidation between $0.40 and $0.42, signaling potential breakout if metrics align. That said, while Polygon is steady, some might view newer presale-stage cryptos like BlockDAG as more attractive for short-term gains. MATIC remains part of the top cryptos to buy today, but buyers chasing higher ROI may look elsewhere. Avalanche (AVAX) AVAX has seen a strong 6% price jump in the last 24 hours, climbing to about $26.40 with daily trading volume over $1.1 billion. The push is largely linked to ETF rumors and the successful launch of the Octane upgrade, which cut C-Chain gas fees by 42.7% and enhanced performance. Avalanche is also prioritizing security and development. Octane Security, which is now active, brings AI-driven audits into the dev workflow, reducing bugs and deployment risks. This has made AVAX more attractive to builders. Meanwhile, derivatives markets show growing open interest, with $835 million currently locked in. Still, compared to BlockDAG’s early-stage price and live features, Avalanche might not deliver the same explosive ROI. While AVAX is dependable, those searching for top cryptos to buy today with higher upside potential may favor BDAG’s offering. Final Take! Choosing among the top cryptos to buy today depends on your appetite for stability versus speed. Ethereum continues to dominate headlines and institutional flows, Polygon offers scalable tech, and Avalanche is turning heads with its development stack. But BlockDAG combines key elements like adoption, working products, and one of the most appealing presale prices in the market. With batch 29 priced at $0.0016 until August 11th, and a 3,025% return window leading up to the $0.05 listing, the math is hard to ignore. Add in the “NO VESTING PASS,” and it’s clear why buyers are racing in. For anyone eyeing fast gains with an already active project, BlockDAG is shaping up as one of the top cryptos to buy today before the window narrows any further.

2025-08-03 06:00:06,49457458,1754200806,XRP Whales Are Buying This New Altcoin for Major Profits,"As XRP continues to show strength in both spot and futures markets, large holders appear to be hedging their bets by diversifying into a promising new altcoin. With institutional confidence returning and the U.S. regulatory climate turning more favorable, market participants are preparing for what could be another major rally. Early indicators point to a quiet accumulation phase—especially among crypto whales—focused on one emerging opportunity that’s quickly drawing attention. One of those projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has emerged as a clear standout. Its momentum is fueled by surging demand and early allocation phases that are closing faster than expected, signaling that whales aren’t waiting around for broader access. XRP Sees Renewed Momentum as Regulatory Fog Clears XRP has regained its footing after a turbulent year, with recent data showing a rise in both liquidity and trading volume. Whales in particular have resumed accumulation, suggesting renewed confidence in Ripple’s legal clarity and the potential for new financial products involving XRP. On the derivatives side, XRP perpetual futures have overtaken Solana on multiple exchanges—a key indicator of growing speculative interest. Spot prices have also surged in response to positive market sentiment tied to potential institutional partnerships and broader crypto-friendly U.S. policies. Analysts are watching for a decisive move above the $3.60 mark to confirm bullish continuation. While XRP attracts traders with strong fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where many early investors see explosive potential . With access windows closing rapidly, a growing number of whales are moving capital into the project before it reaches large-scale visibility. Momentum has grown to the point that allocation rounds are selling out faster than expected , leaving latecomers scrambling. This pattern of fast-paced participation resembles what was seen during the early surges of now-legendary tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s expanding community, fast-paced growth, and comparison to SHIBA INU’s early days make it a top candidate for high-yield speculation. According to multiple trend trackers, entry points available now are unlikely to last long— timing is critical . Whales Are Positioning Themselves Early With crypto markets heating up again, experienced players are combining stability bets like XRP with high-ROI bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This two-pronged strategy of risk-balanced investing is becoming increasingly common, particularly among large-scale holders looking to front-run retail inflows. Whale tracking wallets have shown that some of the same XRP addresses accumulating during the 2020–2021 cycle are now deploying capital into low-cap altcoins, signaling that the smart money is already positioning itself for the next breakout. Conclusion XRP’s resurgence amid a friendlier U.S. crypto climate is attracting both traders and long-term holders. However, it’s the parallel whale activity in MAGACOIN FINANCE that has drawn the most intrigue from market watchers. With entry phases closing rapidly and investor interest at all-time highs , this altcoin is shaping up to be a rare opportunity ahead of its full-scale debut.

2025-08-03 05:45:34,49457456,1754199934,Crypto Whales Just Flagged These 4 Best Meme Coins in 2025 for Potential Moonshots,"What do crypto whales, meme coin analysts, and savvy traders all have in common right now? They’re quietly accumulating positions in a fresh batch of meme coins that could dominate headlines in the coming months. With sentiment heating up, four projects have stood out as the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to rising social buzz, strong communities, and unique narratives. While some of these coins are already riding market momentum, one is still in its early whitelist phase, attracting serious attention for offering early access perks. Let’s dive into the four picks that crypto whales are watching for massive upside potential. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Whitelist-Only Access to the Bulls’ Den There’s one project that hasn’t launched yet, and that’s exactly why it’s getting flagged by insiders. MoonBull is quickly emerging as one of the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to its whitelist-only access model and intense buildup ahead of launch. This Ethereum-based meme coin was made for degens chasing breakout gains. But unlike other tokens flooding the market, MoonBull isn’t offering a public presale. Only whitelisted users can join the launch, and here’s what makes that a big deal: Lowest possible entry price for early adopters Secret staking rewards reserved only for whitelisted wallets Bonus token allocations that aren’t publicly disclosed Private roadmap hints available exclusively to early community members In short, the project is keeping its cards close, and that exclusivity is creating serious momentum. The idea? Get whitelisted or miss your shot. The signup process is simple: users drop their email into the secure whitelist form and get a private alert ahead of Stage One. Why This Coin Made the List MoonBull’s structure is tailor-made for big moves. With limited access, a capped supply, and early-stage excitement building, it’s no wonder that crypto whales have started circling early. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a ticket into a high-energy ecosystem that’s primed for an explosive start. 2. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): Solana’s Viral Tribute to a Fallen Hero Meme coins often reflect the culture of the moment, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a perfect example. Launched on the Solana blockchain, this token is a tribute to a real-life squirrel named Peanut, whose story captured the internet’s attention and sparked a viral movement. What makes PNUT stand out isn’t just its narrative, but how it’s turned emotional resonance into community action. The project channels public sentiment into something tangible: a meme coin that doubles as a symbol of animal advocacy. Its performance on Solana has been steady, and its meme appeal continues to pull in new supporters. Forums, TikTok, and X have been keeping PNUT alive in the conversation as the broader market eyes new narratives. Why did this coin make it to this list? PNUT combines a powerful backstory with a growing user base, making it one of the best meme coins in 2025 for emotional engagement and long-term potential. 3. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): A Gospel of Memes and AI on Solana Next up is Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), a Solana meme coin that’s turning heads with its hilarious and chaotic “Goat Gospel” theme. Powered by a custom AI bot known as the Truth Terminal, GOAT delivers a daily dose of internet chaos, humor, and meme prophecy. This project leans fully into meme culture, embracing randomness and absurdity as a virtue. It doesn’t pretend to have traditional utility, its entire value proposition is entertainment, virality, and the strength of its community. GOAT has built a devoted cult following, and its unique approach is keeping it relevant in a sea of meme clones. Why did this coin make it to this list? GOAT is one of the best meme coins in 2025 for its commitment to pure meme energy and viral AI-generated storytelling, a combo that’s clearly working. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Cult Classic With Pink Hat Power Dogwifhat (WIF) might sound silly at first, and that’s exactly the point. Born from a Shiba Inu wearing a pink hat, WIF has grown into a cultural icon on Solana. It doesn’t offer staking or burning mechanisms, and it doesn’t claim to solve complex problems. What it does offer is a passionate community and consistent attention on social platforms. WIF has proven that even simple concepts can lead to big runs, as long as the community stays active and the memes keep flowing.

2025-08-03 05:33:52,49457380,1754199232,What Next For XRP as $2.75 Level Holds After Sharp Decline From $3,"XRP plunged nearly 9% in the 24-hour session ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), falling from $3.02 to as low as $2.75 before staging a mild recovery to $2.82. The decline was driven by heightened institutional selling pressure, with volumes during the heaviest selling window more than doubling the daily average. Price action suggests potential exhaustion near $2.75, though broader macro and liquidity risks remain elevated. What to Know XRP saw peak sell pressure between 14:00–18:00 on August 2, with volumes reaching 222.24 million—183% higher than the 24-hour average of 78.52 million. The asset bottomed at $2.75, forming short-term support on heavy volume. Recovery attempts stalled at $2.84, with the final hour of trading closing at $2.82, indicating consolidation below key resistance. Volume-weighted price activity suggests accumulation interest at sub-$2.80 levels, but confirmation is lacking. News Background The XRP drawdown came amid widening global trade tensions and renewed tariff uncertainty that shook risk markets across the board. Meanwhile, institutional portfolios appeared to rebalance as macro conditions prompted capital rotation away from altcoins and into more liquid assets. Analysts point to ongoing adjustments by central banks and heightened geopolitical risk as catalysts for the broader sell-off. Price Action Summary High: $3.02 Low: $2.75 Close: $2.82 24H Range: $0.27 (-8.91%) Technical Analysis A volume climax at $2.75 coincided with XRP’s most aggressive hourly decline, typically a signal of capitulation or local bottoming. The $2.75–$2.76 zone now serves as first-layer support, while upside attempts are capped near $2.84. Volume fell sharply in the final hour of trading to ~650,000/min, compared to 3.7 million/min at peak, implying buyer fatigue or neutral flows post-dump. What Traders Are Watching Can XRP hold above $2.75–$2.76 and build a base for recovery, or does failure to reclaim $2.85+ indicate further downside? Watch for institutional inflows or continued exchange outflows, which may validate accumulation narratives.

2025-08-03 05:30:16,49457454,1754199016,Shiba Inu Coin’s utility and community strength continue to grow with the launch of DLMining’s SHIB-focused contracts,"DLMining announced today the official launch of its short-term contracts for Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), one of the most community-driven digital assets on the market. This new product allows everyday users to participate in SHIB-linked rewards programs designed to shorten tenures and increase returns—especially as SHIB’s utility and adoption continue to expand globally. This development comes amid growing interest in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which has evolved from its initial meme coin into a broader decentralized platform with its own Layer 2 blockchain, NFT projects, and expanding payment integrations. By offering structured contracts centered around SHIB, DLMining aims to provide users with easier access to one of the most sought-after and accessible digital assets on the market. Learn more about Shiba Inu Coin Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, Shiba Inu Coin is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB has evolved from its humble beginnings as a meme coin into a decentralized ecosystem supported by a large and active community, the ShibArmy. SHIB consistently ranks among the highest-valued cryptocurrencies, with millions of holders worldwide. With this continued interest, DLMining ‘s newly launched SHIB-based contracts aim to provide users with a simplified way to participate in the asset’s short-term potential without having to navigate a complex trading environment. Broader Ecosystem Shiba Inu now forms the foundation of a broader ecosystem, including: LEASH: Originally a rebase token, LEASH has been repositioned as a store of value within the Shiba ecosystem. Its limited supply of 107,646 tokens has attracted significant investor interest. ShibaSwap: Launched in 2021, ShibaSwap allows users to stake SHIB, redeem it for cryptocurrencies, and earn passive rewards, helping to differentiate SHIB from other meme tokens. Shibarium: The team launched Shibarium in 2023, a Layer 2 blockchain designed to reduce gas fees and increase transaction speeds. The platform currently supports a growing number of DApps, NFTs, and DeFi integrations, enhancing the overall utility of SHIB. With these developments, SHIB’s use cases continue to expand. Platforms like DLMining are building this ecosystem by enabling contract-based participation that is closely tied to SHIB’s evolving role. Market Overview – July 2025 As of the end of July 2025, key SHIB metrics include: Price: $0.00001875 Market Cap: ~$7.5 billion 24-hour Trading Volume: ~$1.14 trillion Total Supply: 1 quadrillion (a significant portion has been burned) Market momentum remains stable in 2025, thanks to SHIB’s comprehensive coverage across major exchanges, wallet integrations, and POS platforms. The ecosystem’s expanding functionality, particularly related to Shibarium, supports long-term investor confidence. DLMining’s products for SHIB reflect this stability and offer users an option to gain investment opportunities over a shorter timeframe through structured contracts. Real-World Usage and Payment Integrations SHIB’s adoption as a payment method has significantly increased. Through integrations with platforms like BitPay, NOWPayments, and Shopping.io, SHIB is now accepted by a growing number of online merchants, retailers, and service providers, including those in the travel industry. This expansion highlights SHIB’s transformation from a speculative asset to a viable medium of exchange. This real-world utility has created a broader user base for SHIB—something DLMining seeks to support by making SHIB-related digital contracts accessible through mobile platforms. Development Roadmap and Future Initiatives Shibarium outlined several upcoming developments designed to enhance the ecosystem: SHIB: Metaverse: A virtual environment that allows users to build, trade, and socialize using SHIB tokens. NFT Expansion: Continued support for Shiboshis, SHIB’s NFT collection, and integration with the broader metaverse. Shibarium Growth: Onboarding more third-party DApps and projects. Token Burning: Ongoing deflationary mechanisms for SHIB, LEASH, and BONE tokens. The ecosystem’s evolution also informs the creation of new utility-focused products, such as DLMining’s short-term SHIB contracts, which allow users to explore SHIB’s growth potential without requiring deep technical knowledge. Participate through DLMining In line with SHIB’s growing influence, DLMining’s new SHIB-exclusive contracts are designed to facilitate limited-time participation in SHIB’s market dynamics. Building on the success of similar products based on Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin, these contracts aim to provide users with short-term investment opportunities with potential returns based on market trends. New users receive a $15 bonus upon registration. Continued Interest in SHIB in 2025 Investors continue to show interest in SHIB for the following reasons: Low Barrier to Entry: SHIB’s low price makes it accessible to a wide range of investors. Continuous Development: Unlike many meme tokens, Shiba Inu continues to evolve through new use cases and platform upgrades. Real-World Integration: Adoption in payments, DeFi, and the virtual world strengthens SHIB’s value proposition.

These two coins offer solid fundamentals but continue to fall short in terms of active performance. The Cardano (ADA) price prediction shows potential gains through August, while the Render (RNDR) chart displays a setup that looks close to breaking out. However, as traders hold off for bigger price moves, many are choosing a faster way to use their crypto, with real-time returns. That’s exactly where Spartans.com comes in. It ranks among the best crypto gaming platforms, designed for people who prefer action over waiting. ADA holders are using their coins on Spartans to unlock 300% welcome bonuses, access a massive library of over 5,963 games, and place bets on everything from basketball to MMA. With rapid crypto payouts and regular daily offers, Spartans has become a more engaging use for coins that would otherwise sit idle. This piece explores why more users are making the switch from passive waiting to active play. How Spartans Turns Idle ADA Into Nonstop Action Many ADA users are beginning to notice the downside of simply letting their crypto stay unused. Since price rallies often take time, people are now engaging with Spartans to turn ADA into real-time rewards. Spartans allows users to deposit ADA and receive a 300% bonus instantly, with a vast gaming selection and same-day withdrawals. Whether it’s slots, card tables, or UFC bets, there’s always something happening. Unlike other platforms, Spartans is tailored specifically for crypto users. Top wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet are supported for quick deposits, and users don’t have to deal with long wait times or ID checks when withdrawing. You can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, USDC, Avalanche, and ADA on both the casino and sportsbook sections, easily switching between them. What separates Spartans from the usual names in crypto casinos is how it adds genuine entertainment and payout potential. There’s a wide range of high-risk slots, live dealer shows, and even crash-style games. For sports fans, Spartans includes everything from major leagues like the NBA and EPL to tennis and eSports, featuring real-time stats, odds, and quick betting slips. With frequent promotions and generous new player rewards, the platform constantly offers fresh ways to win. There’s even a Lamborghini reward program for active users. For those holding ADA and tired of waiting on slow market shifts, Spartans offers a fast-paced and rewarding alternative. ADA Forecast: Is a Move Above $1 Within Reach? Cardano (ADA) looks set to build gradual strength into August. Its current price of $0.82 is holding firm above a key $0.76 support level. If this trend holds, technical charts suggest a possible rise to between $0.90 and $1.05. With broader bullish momentum, some forecasts even stretch as high as $1.30 by Q3’s end. Another factor drawing attention is whale accumulation, as on-chain data reveals a steady rise in large ADA holdings. The upcoming Hydra/Leios upgrade could serve as another boost in the latter half of 2025. Yet, while some are still holding out for a breakout, others are already putting ADA to use through Spartans, taking advantage of fast rewards instead of sitting through market delays. RNDR Charts Show Coiled Momentum Ahead of a Key Breakout Render (RNDR) remains in a tight price window, fluctuating between $4.00 and $5.50. Current prices hover around $4.27, and while volume has dropped, momentum indicators like RSI and moving averages show the coin still has energy for a potential move. Projections for August place RNDR between $5.24 and $5.89, with more bullish targets aiming at $8 if the trend recovers. So far, RNDR has remained just under the critical $5.50 mark. If it breaks through, stronger gains could follow, though slipping below $4.00 may open the door for a fall to $3.60 or lower. While traders monitor this closely, others are already using RNDR on Spartans to win in real time while waiting for the charts to shift. Final Say While ADA looks to cross $1 and RNDR eyes $5.50, both remain in buildup mode. Meanwhile, a growing number of users are taking a different approach, activating their crypto through Spartans. This isn’t just another casino; it’s a crypto-powered gaming and sports betting hub offering 300% welcome bonuses, 5,963+ games, and instant cash-outs. Rather than passively watching the market, users are making their crypto work for them through Spartans. Whether it’s securing a big win on slots or placing live sports bets, the platform provides entertainment and tangible returns. For anyone ready to stop waiting and start using their crypto, Spartans stands out as the smarter route.

2025-08-03 05:00:22,49457453,1754197222,This Trader Just Dumped 35% of His XRP Bag. Here’s Why,"A well-known pseudonymous trader, who goes by the name “A Knowing Faith” on X, has made waves in the crypto community by announcing a significant portfolio shift. He revealed that he sold 35% of his XRP holdings, specifically the portion he had set aside for short-term trade, and reinvested the entire amount into Flare Network (FLR). His rationale is clear: with FLR’s market cap around $1.5 billion, the upcoming launch of FXRP, and already established institutional relationships, he believes the token is positioned to massively outperform XRP in the short term. According to “A Knowing Faith,” the remaining XRP in his portfolio is his long-term hold, intended to be held for years. He now plans to stake this XRP through the Flare Network to earn passive income, while allowing it to appreciate slowly over time. I just sold 35% of my $XRP bag. Essentially all of the $XRP I had left for short term sales. And put it into $FLR there is just ZERO chance that $FLR at one billion market cap with FXRP launching this month and institutional use pre established does not wildly out perform $XRP in… pic.twitter.com/YvWcSYIW8q — A Knowing Faith (@ImmovableFaith1) August 2, 2025 In contrast, he views FLR as the “superstar of this cycle,” arguing that its multi-year consolidation triangle is nearing completion, which could signal an explosive breakout. XRP: A Heavyweight Facing Short-Term Struggles As of report time, XRP is trading around USD 2.80, with a market capitalization of approximately $165 billion and a 24-hour trading volume between $6 $7 billion. While XRP remains a dominant player in the crypto market, the price has struggled to stay above key resistance levels, especially the psychological $3 mark. Recent on-chain data and whale movements have cast a bearish shadow over the asset. One major headline this week was a $175 million XRP transaction linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, which triggered speculation about insider selling. Coupled with falling leverage and significant net outflows, analysts now warn that XRP could fall toward the $2.50 range unless bulls reclaim higher ground above $3.17. While the long-term fundamentals remain intact, XRP’s short-term trajectory appears uncertain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 FLR: Positioned for a Breakout By contrast, Flare Network (FLR) is currently trading at $0.0222, with a market cap of about $1.54 billion and daily trading volume of around $15 million. Though smaller in scale, FLR has seen steady development progress and ecosystem growth. Its dual architecture, featuring the State Connector for cross-chain data and the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO, gives it a unique edge among smart contract platforms. The highly anticipated launch of FXRP , a tokenized version of XRP on the Flare Network, is expected to unlock new use cases and boost network activity. This forms the backbone of “A Knowing Faith’s” bullish thesis. He argues that FLR’s lower market cap and imminent utility expansion make it far more attractive for short-term gains compared to XRP.

2025-08-03 05:00:06,49457455,1754197206,"Ethereum Close to a New Record High, While MAGACOIN Might Lead the Next Crypto Boom","Ethereum is approaching a critical breakout level, with prices now hovering just below the $3,800 mark. Traders and analysts are closely watching the $4,000 resistance zone—a level that could determine whether the largest altcoin enters price discovery or sees a temporary correction. While many investors remain focused on Ethereum, there’s also rising interest in newer, high-potential altcoins that are gaining traction rapidly. One of those names being talked about by crypto communities and insiders alike is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project that’s been quietly building momentum during this market cycle. Ethereum Nears Critical Levels as Bulls Eye $4,900 According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, Ethereum is currently trading near its March 2024 highs but with much lower unrealized profits. That’s a sign of long-term strength and possible continuation. Based on historical trends, Glassnode suggests Ethereum could reach $4,900 to match last year’s unrealized profit levels—a move that would push ETH to a fresh all-time high and possibly spark a broader altcoin rally. Further supporting this bullish outlook are rising ETF inflows, totaling $890 million over the past 30 days, and large corporate ETH holdings, now exceeding $10 billion. These metrics confirm strong institutional conviction. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s RSI on the hourly chart sits near 45, reflecting a neutral state, but with rising open interest and active trading volumes, it appears ETH is gearing up for a major directional move. MAGACOIN FINANCE Sets the Stage for a Breakout of Its Own While Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as one of the most sought-after opportunities among early-stage crypto investors. The project recently broke records for investor participation in its latest phase—a clear indicator of growing confidence and urgency. Market analysts are beginning to compare MAGACOIN’s early-stage traction to that of legendary runs like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN, but with a more strategic ecosystem built for sustained growth. With a projected ROI potential of up to 39x , insiders believe early positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE could prove incredibly profitable, especially before it launches on top-tier exchanges. Its blend of growing utility, scarcity , and expanding community make it a standout in a market full of noise. Ethereum’s Path Depends on Breaking Resistance Back in focus, Ethereum’s technical picture suggests a make-or-break moment is approaching. The key resistance remains the $4,000 zone , which ETH has tested multiple times without success. However, with mounting open interest and strong support near $3,500, the setup looks increasingly bullish. The broader macro environment could also play a role. With the next Fed rate decision due in September, many traders expect volatility to pick up. If Ethereum breaks $4,000 in the coming weeks, it could trigger a run toward $4,900 or even $5,000 , especially if altseason picks up alongside it. Conclusion Ethereum’s steady climb is reigniting hope for a new all-time high, but all eyes remain on the $4,000 threshold. If bulls break through, it could mark the beginning of the next explosive phase in crypto. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to outperform expectations , racking up presale milestones and drawing comparisons to the biggest meme coin success stories . For investors seeking early advantage, both ETH’s rally and MAGACOIN’s breakout potential are impossible to ignore.

2025-08-03 04:55:33,49457395,1754196933,BTC Down $10K From ATH – Here Are Bitcoin’s Next Support Zones (Analyst),"TL;DR The primary cryptocurrency has been in a free-fall state for the past few days, dropping from $119,000 to a multi-week low of under $112,000 hours ago. A popular analyst has highlighted the most significant support zones that could be tested next. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView The chart above paints a clear picture. Bitcoin peaked in mid-July after an impressive rally and shot beyond $123,000 to mark its latest record. However, it couldn’t maintain such high levels and started to retrace. It spent the next ten days or so in a relatively tight range between $117,000 and $120,000 with little to no success during its breakout attempts in either direction. After a fakeout on July 25, which the bulls managed to defend, the actual breakdown started to take place at the end of the month and as August began. BTC was rejected at the $119,000 line and pushed south to just under $112,000 yesterday, which became a new three-week low. Some of the reasons behind this notable nosedive can be found here , which range from macro tension and uncertainty to investors offloading substantial BTC quantities. Building on the latter, Ali Martinez noted that miners have also been selling lately, dumping more than 3,000 BTC in just two weeks. Miners have offloaded over 3,000 Bitcoin $BTC in the past two weeks! pic.twitter.com/enP4JtUyMs — Ali (@ali_charts) August 2, 2025 Given bitcoin’s crash, which liquidated nearly $1 billion in over-leveraged positions at one point, the analyst also discussed the next key support zones for the asset. They range between $105,000 and $107,000. Later, Martinez reiterated the importance of the $107,100 line as a large accumulation point for BTC’s future price trajectory. $107,160 continues to emerge as a crucial support level for Bitcoin $BTC ! pic.twitter.com/izOejLbagA — Ali (@ali_charts) August 2, 2025 So far, the cryptocurrency has remained well above that level as it currently trades above $113,000. However, more volatility is expected on Monday when all financial markets open. Additionally, Trump has a habit of making important announcements that rattle markets on Sundays, so watch out.

2025-08-03 04:43:51,49457393,1754196231,Here Are 4 Bullish Signals: ETH Momentum Is Building,"Positivity in the crypto markets remains strong despite the most recent turmoil on the charts. This is especially true for ETH’s community, as the altcoin has seen more than 35% added to its price over the past 30 days. But who are the biggest players making the Ethereum trade and driving ETH prices ever higher? ETH Gains Lag Behind BTC Since 2022 In chemical science, ether is a humor, and the better part of good humor is excellent timing. Over most 30-day periods in the past 12 months, crypto investors would have been better off holding Bitcoin if their goal was to achieve a higher 30-day ROI from their investment. The trailing 12-month return on investment for BTC is +75% compared to ETH’s +19% over the same period. Some Ethereum holders have been wondering what’s up with its market action compared to Bitcoin’s. In large part, the Ethereum base layer, by design, sacrificed capital inflows over the past 12 months to low-fee Layer 2 Ethereum networks and capital inflows to their currencies. These include, among some of the largest by total market cap, Mantle (MNT), POL (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Starknet (STRK). It’s like trying to inflate a balloon, but there’s a vent with extra air going into a bunch of other balloons first before you get enough air pressure to keep inflating the main balloon. To top that off, Ethereum is a very big balloon, clocking August 2nd at $468 billion in market capitalization on a fascinating multi-year trend line since 2015 for long-term saver investors. That said, here are four bullish portents that the sign of ETH is rising in the air: 1. Ethereum Roars Back In Multi-Billion Dollar Wall Street Frenzy A month into Q3, the pressure from inflows to the Ether economy has finally built up to the point of pushing its price back up and really moving the needle. Ethereum’s phenomenal July price gains show demand has grown broad and deep enough to overcome the massive planned leakage of inflows to Ethereum Layer 2s. That’s got the bulls posting wild price predictions, like BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, who said, “Ether = $10,000” on Jul. 22. He also made these comments in a post on his Medium blog: “Ever since Solana rose from the FTX ashes from $7 to $280, Ether has been the most hated large-cap crypto. No more; the Western institutional investor class, whose chief cheerleader is Tom Lee, loves Ether. Buy first, ask questions later.” 2. Ethereum ETFs Blowout Record Inflows Iconic Wall Street mascot Gordon Gekko once said, “Greed is good.” A massive cohort on Wall Street is already aware of blockchain’s usefulness and has become addicted to Bitcoin and Ether returns in 2025. They’ve been backing up the entire boat and loading up on Ether tokens through ETFs, custody services, and on-chain developments. Capital inflows to buy Ethereum ETFs shattered a record in July as feverish demand on Wall Street picked up pace. Ether ETFs attracted $2.12 billion in a week in mid-July and continued to ramp up huge sums in the weeks that followed, despite the relative market slowdown. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Investments, wrote on July 22 a note outlining the “Ethereum Demand Shock,” which is pumping ETH prices up with all this ROI-hungry capital from Wall Street ETF buyers and a bevy of new Ether corporate treasury companies with publicly traded shares on the US stock market. 3. SharpLink Gaming Stakes Hundreds of Millions in ETH This online sports betting company, based in Minneapolis and traded on Nasdaq, has a business model ripe for disruption by blockchain solutions to create fairness and security for online players. Following up on Strategy, Inc.’s BTC treasury campaign, SharpLink had acquired 188,478 ETH by June 25. That would be worth nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars a month later. After that, over five days in mid-July, SharpLink took another whale-sized corporate bite out of the Ethereum supply. The online sports betting specialists locked in 60,582 ETH worth some $180 million. Meanwhile, Wall Street rewarded the company for the move, jolting its stock by 17% in under 24 hours. By Jul. 16, SharpLink Gaming had locked in 280,000 ETH, worth around $900 million, throwing a supply pinch, rallying Ether bulls, and drastically changing the calculus for Ether price valuations. Its holdings continue to increase almost daily and stand at over 480,000 ETH as of August 3. The company says it’s staking all of that and generating hundreds of thousands of dollars weekly in yields by holding its Ether staked. 4. Bitmine’s $250 Million and Growing Ether Fund In addition to SharpLink Gaming, there’s Las Vegas-based Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a US blockchain firm that recently pivoted to buying, holding, and staking ETH. They brought in Tom Lee, the FundStrat executive who used to appear on CNBC during the pandemic and say that Bitcoin would eventually reach $1 million. At the same time, the other commentators smiled and nodded. To start off July, Bitmine launched a $250 million corporate Ether treasury , and its stock soared 3,000% in almost no time, rising from the penny bin to above $135 a share.

According to Lee, this step could herald a new era for Ethereum (ETH). Tom Lee noted that Ethereum has been performing strongly against Bitcoin since April, with the ETH/BTC ratio steadily rising. He argued that Wall Street's interest in Ethereum is behind this move. According to Lee, the development of stablecoins on Ethereum has become a “ChatGPT moment” for the blockchain. Lee stated that the “Project Crypto” initiative, jointly announced by the SEC and the White House, aims to solidify the US's global leadership by moving financial markets onto the chain. “This means stepping into the golden age of finance,” Lee said, noting that Ethereum is the blockchain with the largest smart contract infrastructure. Related News: Company Known as Ethereum's MicroStrategy Purchased Another Large Amount of ETH Today Also Ethereum: It is the largest smart contract network and the most compliant with US regulations, It has never experienced an interruption since its establishment, JPMorgan said that giants like Robinhood prefer ETH in their tokenization processes. In the short term, Lee expects the ETH/BTC ratio to return to last year's levels (around 0.0500). In this scenario, Ethereum's price could rise to $5,707 in an environment where Bitcoin is trading at $114,000. According to the Fundstrat digital asset team, ETH is predicted to reach a fair value of between $10,000 and $20,000 in the next 12 months. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s why,"In response to Jim Cramer’s latest remark: “I always despise both August and September… just tough months to make money”, crypto influencer Amelie fired back with conviction: “WE ARE SO BACK — AUGUST & SEPTEMBER WILL BE BULLISH AF FOR XRP HOLDERS.” Her post, which quickly gained traction, is more than just hype. It reflects a growing belief among analysts and investors that XRP is poised for a major rally over the coming weeks. Cramer’s Comment Spurs Contrarian Optimism Cramer’s comment, while seemingly negative, is being interpreted as a classic contrarian indicator. Traders have long joked that doing the opposite of his public calls often yields better results. In that light, Amelie’s excitement suggests the market could be setting up for a breakout, especially for XRP. WE ARE SO BACK AUGUST & SEPTEMBER WILL BE BULLISH AF FOR #XRP HOLDERS pic.twitter.com/NA1YJznwvz — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) August 2, 2025 XRP Technical Outlook: Signs of a Breakout After peaking at $3.66 on July 18, XRP saw a pullback to around $2.89 by late July. This 16% correction appeared to signal weakness, but under the surface, analysts noticed bullish divergence—a signal that sellers are losing steam and a reversal may be forming. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.85. Analysts point to the $3.03–$3.10 range as a critical resistance zone. A strong daily close above this level could trigger a breakout toward $3.50 and beyond. Some projections suggest a surge to $4.00 or even $5.00 could be achieved in the short term if momentum holds. Bullish Forecasts from Analysts Crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino recently predicted a 333% surge in XRP’s price, potentially pushing it to $13 within 40 days. His projection is based on a classic Elliott Wave triangle breakout, supported by long-term accumulation and reduced volatility. Peter Brandt, another respected voice in technical analysis, sees potential for a 60% rally, targeting $4.47. Meanwhile, Bitget’s research team forecasts XRP hitting $5 by year-end, citing institutional adoption and expanding real-world use cases in cross-border payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other outlets, including Analytics Insight and Finance Magnates, anticipate that XRP could reach between $8 and $9 by mid-September under sustained bullish conditions and favorable macro factors such as ETF momentum or regulatory clarity. Institutional Accumulation Adds Fuel Recent on-chain data shows over 82 million XRP, worth approximately $246 million, moved off exchanges into cold storage. This pattern typically signals accumulation by large holders, reinforcing the bullish case. Combined with declining selling pressure and rising trading volumes, market structure appears to favor upside movement. Why Amelie Might Be Right Amelie’s bold declaration isn’t just a gut feeling. It’s supported by a convergence of strong technical signals, optimistic price forecasts, institutional accumulation, and favorable macro conditions. In a market where sentiment often leads price, her timing could prove prophetic. If XRP decisively clears the $3.25 to $3.50 resistance in the coming days, a strong rally toward $4 or $5 in August looks increasingly likely, with potential to reach $9 or higher by mid-September in a breakout scenario. For XRP holders, this might just be the comeback season Amelie predicted. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-08-02 18:30:17,49436177,1754159417,"Coinbase Delists Function X, Lists New Tokens Amid Service Expansion","Coinbase, the first crypto firm to join the S&P 500 index, recently announced that it will suspend trading for Function X (FX) on August 15, 2025. Coinbase made this decision after a routine review process. This move is part of the exchange’s strategy to ensure all listed assets continue to meet its strict listing standards. Coinbase Drops FX, Adds New Tokens The leading crypto exchange, with an over $100 billion market cap , found that the Function X project team had paused the smart contract linked to the token. This came after the team recently migrated the original FX ERC-20 token to a new one called Pundi AI (PUNDIAI). As a result of this change, the old FX token no longer meets Coinbase’s listing standards. As of now, FX order books on Coinbase have been moved to limit-only mode. This means users can still place or cancel limit orders, and matches can happen. However, no new market orders are accepted. FX trading will be suspended across all Coinbase platforms, including Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. While removing FX, Coinbase is also adding new assets to its platform. As announced, Bio Protocol (BIO), BankrCoin (BNKR), and Treehouse (TREE) are now available for buying, selling, converting, sending, receiving, and storing. These tokens can be accessed through the Coinbase website and mobile apps on iOS and Android. Coinbase Partners With JP Morgan and Samsung This move comes as Coinbase is expanding its reach through new partnerships. In July, the company announced a partnership with JP Morgan Chase , one of the largest U.S. banks. This will allow its users to connect their Chase bank accounts directly. Also, users can now even use their Chase credit cards to earn and redeem crypto rewards. In addition, Coinbase has started rolling out Samsung Pay as a payment method for buying crypto. The feature is now available in the U.S. and Canada, making it easier for users to add money to their accounts. At the same time, the company continues to show strong confidence in Bitcoin (BTC). As of June 30, the company added 2,509 BTC in the second quarter of 2025. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 11,776 BTC, bought at a total cost of $740 million. Big Progress for Crypto Regulation in the U.S. Coinbase’s recent progress comes after big news for the U.S. crypto industry. In July, the Trump administration signed the GENIUS Act into law , helping to set clearer rules for digital assets. Another bill, called CLARITY, is also moving forward and now heads to the Senate. These new laws are expected to boost the crypto market and make investors feel more confident.

2025-08-02 18:30:00,49434721,1754159400,Could This Be the Next $10 Coin? Investors Compare It to Chainlink (LINK) in Its First Year,"When Chainlink (LINK) first entered the crypto scene, it did so without hype or flash—but with a strong mission and a clear roadmap. Back then, most overlooked it as just another altcoin. Yet those who recognized its fundamentals and got in early saw massive returns, as LINK cemented itself as a key infrastructure player in decentralized finance. Today, the crypto world may be witnessing the beginning of another similar trajectory. A new project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads for all the right reasons and gaining serious attention for echoing LINK’s early momentum—except this time, with even more utility baked in from the start. Institutional-Level Infrastructure and Token Utility Already in Place Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale, but already giving off strong signals of long-term strength. The protocol is building a decentralized, non-custodial lending platform with both P2P and P2C models. Through the P2C model, lenders deposit stablecoins or blue-chip tokens like ETH, BTC, or USDT into smart contract pools and receive mtTokens, which not only represent their share of the pool but also grow in value as interest accrues. Borrowers, on the other hand, will be able to access overcollateralized loans using those same high-quality tokens as collateral—offering capital efficiency without needing to sell their holdings. Rates are governed by pool utilization, ensuring sustainable returns for lenders. The P2P system is designed for more flexible term-based deals, appealing to users seeking higher returns or bespoke agreements. But beyond lending mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is weaving in advanced tokenomics that many now consider the gold standard. One such feature is mtToken staking. Users who stake their mtTokens in designated smart contracts will earn MUTM as rewards—sourced directly from protocol revenue. Unlike inflationary models, the MUTM used for staking rewards will be bought back from the open market, creating continuous demand. In addition, the platform is preparing to launch its own decentralized stablecoin at listing. This stablecoin will be overcollateralized and minted only when a loan is issued, ensuring a controlled supply and maintaining a firm $1 peg. Borrowers will unlock it only by locking blue-chip assets, and it will be burned upon loan repayment—eliminating inflation risk and aligning supply with real-time market activity. To ensure trust and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underwent a CertiK audit, earning an impressive Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. This level of scrutiny, combined with a $50,000 bug bounty in collaboration with CertiK, signals a clear commitment to security—something Chainlink also focused heavily on during its foundational years. Furthermore, the platform’s upcoming integration with Layer-2 networks will unlock faster transactions and drastically reduced gas fees, making it far more accessible and scalable than most competitors. Presale Traction Signals Early Institutional Confidence As of now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, with over 10% of its 170 million token allocation already sold. That means investors have already poured in substantial capital—bringing total raised to more than $13.90 million across 14,800+ holders. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, representing a 15% increase, so the current entry point may very well be the final chance to secure tokens before listing momentum kicks in. To amplify community growth, a $100,000 giveaway is ongoing, rewarding 10 winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. It’s one of the few presales combining serious tokenomics with aggressive community engagement—two ingredients that drove LINK’s viral early-stage success. Those who bought into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at Phase 1, when the price was $0.01, are already sitting on a 6x gain. With the token expected to list at $0.06, current Phase 6 participants are still getting a highly discounted entry price. And with price targets from analysts suggesting $1.50 and beyond post-launch, early investors stand to capture over 30x upside from their entry. That kind of return places MUTM squarely in the same league as LINK’s historic rise during its first year of market exposure. The Road Ahead: A Four-Phase Plan Toward DeFi Dominance While the presale is building momentum, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is also methodically executing a clear four-phase roadmap. Phase 1 (Initiating) focused on launching the presale, completing the CertiK audit, and laying the foundation for listings and infrastructure. Phase 2 (Building) centers on development of the lending protocol, smart contract integrations, and Layer-2 support. Phase 3 (Finalizing) will include refining risk management, launching the stablecoin mechanism, and preparing liquidity pools. Phase 4 (Delivering) will see the full public beta rollout, protocol expansion, and long-term staking and reward modules. This isn’t a meme coin trying to ride hype—it’s a purpose-built financial protocol backed by robust technology and transparent execution. As Chainlink (LINK) has shown, true value comes from solving real problems and offering tools DeFi actually needs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following a similar playbook—only this time, with even more reward potential locked in at these early stages.

2025-08-02 18:30:00,49436845,1754159400,SHIB eyes 100% gains but analysts warn of a new generation memecoin breakout,"The Shiba Inu price prediction buzz is growing after a tough week, with traders watching for a fast rebound. At the same time, Remittix is earning real attention after raising over $17.9 million by selling 578 million tokens at $0.0895 each. Many see the Remittix DeFi project as a practical rival while some analysts hint that a fresh memecoin wave could arrive soon. Shiba Inu price prediction: cup and handle signals and key lines to beat Source: Joe Swanson On the daily chart, a classic cup and handle setup supports a constructive Shiba Inu price prediction if buyers defend recent lows. Despite the pullback, Shiba Inu held key support twice, which backs a patient Shiba Inu price prediction for a climb into August. If momentum returns, the Shiba Inu price prediction points to recoveries toward prior July highs, while a loss of support would delay the move. Analysts who track Shiba Inu also note double bottom hints and improving volume on green days, adding fuel to a cautious Shiba Inu price prediction. If price clears near term resistance with a strong daily close, the Shiba Inu price prediction for a 100 percent swing improves, though Shiba Inu must keep volume rising to confirm the break. With wider markets still shaky after the FOMC ripple effect, Shiba Inu needs clean closes to stay on track. Remittix (RTX): why traders see a utility play in a memecoin season Remittix aims to make cross border payouts simple with low gas fee crypto, Crypto staking, and a cross-chain DeFi project design for workers, freelancers, and businesses. It is crypto with real utility, a top crypto under $1, and a low cap crypto gems pick among upcoming crypto projects on top crypto to buy now lists. Many plan to buy RTX token as a best long term crypto investment and a next 100x crypto candidate.

2025-08-02 18:24:59,49434276,1754159099,XRP Proponent Laments: So Ripple CEO Sold $200 Million of XRP at the Top,"A wave of frustration has swept through the XRP community following revelations that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold approximately $200 million worth of XRP near the recent market peak. The information, first flagged by blockchain analytics platform Xaif, was amplified in a post by prominent crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord, who questioned Garlinghouse’s faith in XRP’s long-term promise if he chose to offload such a substantial amount at the top. XRP sales linked to Garlinghouse’s wallets were reportedly spread over 10 days, sparking interest due to their large size and suspicious timing, which coincided with XRP’s local price peak. On-chain data from platforms like Lookonchain and confirmations from Xaif point to a deliberate and strategic liquidation that has unsettled parts of the XRP holder base. So Brad Garlinghouse sold $200m of $XRP at the top If it’s the future of finance why would he do that? This shit is starting to feel like a scam. The white house didn’t even mention it. I can feel a CTO coming on — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) August 1, 2025 Context: Past and Present XRP Sales This isn’t the first time Garlinghouse’s XRP holdings have raised eyebrows. In its 2020 lawsuit, the SEC disclosed that Garlinghouse sold approximately $600 million worth of XRP between 2017 and 2020, mainly on non-US exchanges. These earlier sales became central to the SEC’s claim that Ripple executives were profiting from unregistered securities offerings. With Ripple’s multi-year legal battle against the SEC nearing its end, some see the timing of this new $200 million sale as curious. In June 2025, Ripple Labs officially withdrew its cross-appeal against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following Judge Analisa Torres’ denial of the proposed final settlement agreement. The SEC is expected to follow suit, effectively closing one of the crypto industry’s most closely watched legal disputes. Community Reaction and Questions of Trust The backlash from the community has been swift. “If XRP is the future of finance, why would Brad sell now?” asked Crypto Bitlord. He also criticized the lack of government support, noting that the White House failed to mention XRP in its latest statements on digital asset innovation, further fueling fears that the project may be losing relevance on the national stage. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some users went as far as to call XRP a scam , citing these executive sell-offs as evidence that key figures are cashing out while everyday investors hold bags of hope. The sentiment was echoed by several influential voices on X, with one user stating, “It’s starting to feel like we’ve all been had.” Defending the Sale Supporters of Garlinghouse argue that executives are entitled to sell tokens for personal diversification, tax strategy, or liquidity, especially after years of navigating regulatory hostility. They also point out that Garlinghouse still holds significant XRP and Ripple equity, with his net worth estimated in the multi-billion-dollar range. Still, critics believe the optics are damaging. At a time when the XRP community is expecting utility breakthroughs and institutional adoption, a high-profile sale like this casts doubt on whether even Ripple’s leadership believes in the vision they’ve long championed.

2025-08-02 18:15:00,49435482,1754158500,"XRP to reach $10 by 2025, analysts say MUTM could follow with 30x returns","Could one of the best-performing cryptos of the decade soon be joined by a newcomer priced under 4 cents? While XRP sets its sights on a potential $10 rally by 2025, attention is turning toward another project that’s still in presale but showing early signs of outsized growth potential. With its current price at just $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being positioned by analysts as the next big cryptocurrency to watch. Ripple (XRP) price prediction: heading toward $10? XRP has been quietly climbing since early 2024, and recent forecasts suggest that the cryptocurrency could hit $10 by the end of 2025. That projection isn’t built on hype—it reflects a broader shift in institutional support, improving regulatory clarity, and the growing adoption of Ripple’s payment infrastructure. While volatility remains, analysts have pointed to the token’s recovery from sub-$1 levels to its recent position above $3 as a sign that momentum is real. Some forecasts even lean on technical patterns such as Elliott Wave theory and Fibonacci retracements to justify the $10 price point. Others cite major whale movements, rising trading volume, and Ripple’s expanding presence in global remittances. Regardless of the method, the takeaway is clear: XRP is no longer flying under the radar, and its current price action reflects a wider trend of accumulation across top cryptocurrencies. What is Mutuum Finance and why experts say it has 30x potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new decentralized protocol built around real DeFi utility. Its model is centered on lending and borrowing, with users able to participate through smart contract-based liquidity pools. What sets it apart, though, is that it supports both overcollateralized borrowing and passive lending through a dynamic dual-token system. Users receive mtTokens when depositing assets, which represent their share of the pool and automatically accrue value through interest. The protocol is preparing to launch a beta version of its platform shortly after token listing, a move that analysts believe will have a significant impact on its adoption. This post-launch milestone is expected to open the door for top-tier centralized exchange (CEX) listings, increasing exposure and buy pressure from new participants. With the launch price locked in at $0.06 and the presale still in Phase 6 at $0.035, the upside is already locked in for early buyers—around 100% gains at listing. Analysts who are tracking presale performance and token utility believe MUTM could climb as high as 30x, driven by rising demand, incoming product rollout, and the momentum that follows a successful launch on CEXs. When it hits that target, the token would be trading near $1.05, making it one of the most profitable tokens of the cycle. Why timing matters: entry at $0.035 could lead to massive gains With more than $13.8 million raised and over 14,700 holders, Mutuum Finance is one of the fastest-growing DeFi presales currently live. Phase 6 is already active, and as each phase sells out, the token price edges closer to its final listing value. For those entering now at $0.035, the difference is clear. A $2,000 investment at today’s price would yield approximately 58,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $1.05, that same position would be worth over $60,000. That’s the power of early entry in a well-structured cryptocurrency presale, especially when the fundamentals are strong and there’s a defined roadmap post-launch. Unlike many tokens that go live with no real ecosystem in place, Mutuum Finance has outlined clear next steps, including the beta platform release and multichain expansion. Additionally, the team is currently undergoing a CertiK smart contract audit, which adds another layer of trust. CertiK is one of the most respected blockchain auditing firms, and a successful audit not only boosts investor confidence but also serves as a positive signal for CEX listings. The protocol has also opened a security bug bounty, strengthening its infrastructure ahead of the platform’s public rollout. Could this be the best crypto to buy now? With XRP aiming for $10 and gaining traction in institutional circles, attention is shifting toward earlier-stage opportunities with similarly high upside. Mutuum Finance stands out among new crypto coins by offering a working product model, real token utility, and a built-in rewards mechanism through its buy-and-redistribute system, which sends a portion of revenue back to mtToken stakers. This creates an organic way to generate passive income for long-term holders. It’s rare to find a new DeFi crypto this early in development that’s also passed the $13M fundraising milestone and still offers entry under $0.04. Whether you’re looking for the next crypto to hit $1 or simply seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in before broader adoption, MUTM is gaining attention for all the right reasons.

2025-08-02 18:01:08,49433270,1754157668,Inside GAIA’s Plan to Democratize AI With Open Infrastructure (Exclusive Interview),"GAIA has partnered with Samsung to launch a limited-edition AI-native phone, built on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Designed for AI sovereignty, the device enables users to run large language models directly on-device, eliminating cloud dependency while offering privacy, ownership, and rewards through its decentralized AI ecosystem. In this interview, Shashank Sripada, the project’s COO and Co-founder, explains how the GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 aims to make AI sovereignty tangible, offering users direct control over their data and digital assistants from the device itself. You describe GAIA as enabling “AI sovereignty.” In practical terms, what does that mean for the average user in regions where privacy concerns are high but technical literacy is low? AI sovereignty means control over your data, models, and the intelligence that acts on your behalf. For users in high-privacy regions with limited technical skill, GAIA offers turnkey domains and agent templates that let anyone deploy personal AI tools without ceding control to cloud platforms. Practically, this means: Your data stays local – inference can happen on-device or in a domain you control. You choose the agent – whether it’s open-source or fine-tuned to your context. No centralized surveillance – responses are composable, auditable, and censorship-resistant. Think of it like Signal meets ChatGPT – but powered by you, not a trillion-dollar cloud monopoly. Some argue that decentralized AI layers will simply recreate centralization under different labels if network participation is limited. How will GAIA avoid this pitfall? GAIA’s network economics, architecture, and governance are specifically designed to resist re-centralization: Open Node Access: Anyone can run a node – even on mobile or low-power edge devices – and stake to participate in inference. Deterministic Reward Distribution: Node rewards are tied to performance and decentralization, not centralized hosting or capital. Decentralized Domains & Agents: Value capture happens at the edge – meaning builders, not just validators or miners, accrue value. On-chain governance: Protocol upgrades and reward structures are governed by token holders, not a centralized foundation. In short, participation is low-barrier and structurally distributed. The economic incentives scale with decentralization, not against it. What regulatory or legal challenges do you anticipate GAIA facing with operating on-device AI inference and integrated wallets, especially with jurisdictions that have strict rules on AI and crypto? We’re proactively navigating this intersection of AI and crypto with a jurisdiction-aware architecture: On-device inference is akin to running local software or using open-source tools – not a regulated service on its own. Integrated wallets follow existing patterns from dApps and DeFi, but we ensure non-custodial design, user consent flows, and limited data exposure to stay clear of financial intermediation triggers. Jurisdictional fallback: Where required, GAIA can implement region-specific gating, disclosures, or compliance toggles, especially around KYC, model access, and token transfers. Partnerships with legal advisors in the US, EU, and Asia ensure we’re compliant with evolving AI transparency, explainability, and crypto rulesets. Regulation is inevitable – and GAIA’s modular structure makes it adaptable to emerging norms without compromising decentralization. How does GAIA plan to handle potential regulatory challenges around crypto rewards tied to hardware sales, especially in the US, where token incentives may trigger securities scrutiny? The GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 is designed to demonstrate what a fully decentralized AI interface looks like – one that is both sovereign by design and modular by implementation. From a regulatory perspective, GAIA avoids direct entanglements by ensuring that: The hardware functions as an open AI device, not as a financial instrument or token distribution tool. On-device inference is local-first and privacy-preserving – akin to using offline AI models or edge apps – not a hosted or custodial service. The integration of Web3 infrastructure (wallets, domain management, agent registries) follows non-custodial patterns, allowing users to interact with decentralized networks on their terms. Crucially, the GAIA Phone does not require any blockchain interaction to operate as a powerful AI assistant. This allows the phone to ship globally with optional features gated or localized based on regional legal norms – ensuring compliance without compromising on the broader vision. Rather than embedding financial assumptions into hardware, GAIA’s approach centers on empowering users to run private, autonomous AI agents locally – with full transparency, auditability, and freedom from centralized gatekeepers. Consumer education could be a major hurdle for Gaia’s adoption. Practically, how will you convince crypto users accustomed to wallets and DeFi to trust a decentralized AI phone, and what incentives or network effects will drive them to become node operators? The GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 is more than a phone – it’s a blueprint for how AI should work in a decentralized world. It delivers an experience that is immediately useful, deeply private, and intuitively extensible, even for non-technical users. Here’s how we’re solving the consumer onboarding challenge: Out-of-the-box utility The phone ships with pre-installed on-device AI agents that work from day one – including smart assistants, workspace copilots, and knowledge managers. Users experience low-latency, offline AI without needing to log in to cloud APIs – reducing friction and boosting trust. Seamless Web3 integration (without the learning curve) GAIA’s mobile stack includes a built-in wallet and agent registry, but is designed to be opt-in, non-custodial, and user-directed. Users can onboard into domains, deploy their own agents, or build automations via visual interfaces, not smart contract code. Real-world relevance and differentiation: Unlike typical phones that outsource intelligence to centralized servers, the GAIA phone empowers users to own their compute, their data, and their decision layer. This directly appeals to users in regions with strong data sovereignty values, privacy expectations, and distrust of platform monopolies. In effect, the GAIA phone makes decentralized AI tangible – not as an abstract concept, but as a daily tool that’s faster, safer, and smarter than the cloud. It’s our most powerful demonstration yet of how GAIA’s infrastructure can scale into the hands of millions – not through ideology, but through utility.

2025-08-02 18:00:49,49433629,1754157649,"Best Crypto Gambling Sites in 2025 Ranked, Spartans’ Position Might Surprise You","As crypto gambling sites in 2025 continue gaining momentum, users are no longer satisfied with flashy themes alone. They now expect faster speeds, transparent features, higher RTPs, and seamless play. Simply relying on brand hype is no longer enough. Platforms that prioritize real user satisfaction and fast payouts are now leading the pack. This breakdown ranks the five most talked-about crypto gambling sites this year, Stake.com, Roobet, BC.Game, BetMGM, and Spartans, based on essential usability factors like user interface, crypto compatibility, RTP reliability, and in-game flow. You’ll see how each one performs and why Spartans.com may be the most overlooked gem. 1. Spartans: The Sleekest & Fastest-Performing Crypto Gambling Site in 2025 Although Spartans .com is a relatively new entry among crypto gambling sites in 2025, it’s setting the bar in all the right ways. Built specifically for crypto users, the platform allows lightning-fast deposits and withdrawals in BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and AVAX, offering instant wallet connections and basic access without mandatory KYC. Its interface is sharp, combining simplicity with depth, making it easy to move between casino, sportsbook, and live games without confusion. Spartans stands out in RTP clarity and smooth gameplay. Every slot and live game runs without lag, even in mobile browsers. Its built-in betslip calculator and live stats tools give sports bettors an advantage, and the site’s crash and game show formats seem tailored for crypto-savvy users. Promotions include daily reload bonuses, clear giveaways, and even a Lamborghini prize, all with transparent rules. While Stake.com still leads in visibility, Spartans proves that fast and consistent performance is what keeps players returning. 2. Stake.com: Top Choice for Community & Global Brand Presence Stake.com remains a leader among crypto gambling sites in 2025, widely known for its global recognition, celebrity sponsorships, and loyal user base. Its desktop interface remains clean and user-friendly, and its betting slip system is still one of the best for combining multiple wagers. Stake excels in features that encourage community interaction, such as live chat and group betting, making it feel like a social platform. The platform supports quick crypto transactions and a broad list of tokens, including BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP. However, RTP reliability varies by provider, and it hasn’t fully embraced newer Web3 wallet integrations. For users who value brand recognition and community features, Stake.com is still a strong pick, though more performance-driven users might seek alternatives this year. 3. Roobet: Strong Game Variety but UI Design Needs Attention Roobet performs well in terms of licensing and game selection, offering thousands of titles from well-known providers. It supports BTC, ETH, and USDC for fast transactions and has added some limited smart contract withdrawal options. Performance is generally solid, and unique games like “Roobet Crash” remain popular with users. However, the platform’s interface can feel cluttered, especially on mobile devices. The design lacks the clarity seen in newer crypto gambling sites, and gameplay may lag during peak hours. While Roobet remains popular due to its long-term presence and loyalty perks, the interface could use a serious redesign to improve user experience. 4. BC.Game: Full of Features, but Not Ideal for Beginners BC.Game continues to rank among the top crypto gambling sites in 2025 when it comes to token support and DeFi tools. It accepts a huge range of cryptocurrencies and features its own utility token, which connects directly to bonuses and games. With options like mini-games, provably fair content, and shared jackpots, it has no shortage of variety for active players. The downside is that the platform can overwhelm newcomers. The homepage is packed with pop-ups, spinning bonus wheels, and constant chat windows, which can distract from actual gaming. Although it does well in RTP performance and crypto transaction speed, the noisy interface makes the experience less smooth. BC.Game works well for crypto veterans but may not suit players seeking simplicity. 5. BetMGM: Reliable Reputation, But Limited Crypto Support BetMGM, known for its roots in traditional betting, has cautiously entered the crypto gambling scene. The platform features one of the best-designed sportsbook layouts and polished casino interfaces. However, it only supports major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and withdrawals often take hours or require ID checks. RTP rates are dependable, and its partnerships with trusted providers like Evolution and NetEnt guarantee stable gameplay. Still, BetMGM trails behind in terms of wallet responsiveness and overall in-game flow. It’s a safe option for players who prefer established brands, but it lacks the agility crypto users have come to expect. Identifying the Best Crypto Gambling Site in 2025 There’s no shortage of crypto gambling sites in 2025 , but only a few truly meet the needs of today’s players. Stake.com still dominates in terms of brand and community features, while Roobet and BC.Game bring solid content and token variety. BetMGM delivers a familiar feel with traditional backing, yet falls short on crypto execution. Then there’s Spartans, the newcomer that avoids marketing fluff and delivers what really matters: fast gameplay, transparent features, and reliable crypto support. If you’re ready to upgrade from casual play to a rewarding and efficient crypto gambling experience, Spartans could be your smartest move this year.

2025-08-02 18:00:47,49434317,1754157647,‘Chokepoint 3.0’ Has Arrived? a16z Warns of Anti-Crypto Bank Tactics,"Big banks are making it harder and more expensive for consumers to use fintech and crypto apps, which amounts to what could be seen as ""Operation Chokepoint 3.0."" That’s according to Alex Rampell, General Partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). In its latest fintech newsletter , Rampell pointed to traditional financial institutions charging high fees to access account data or move money, particularly to services like Coinbase or Robinhood, as a move to strangle the competition. ""Under the Biden administration, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 tried to debank and deplatform crypto,"" Rampell said. ""That era has ended, but now the banks are aiming to implement their own Chokepoint 3.0 — charging insanely high fees to access data or move money to crypto and fintech apps — and, more concerningly, blocking crypto and fintech apps they don’t like,"" he added. Chokepoint 2.0 refers specifically to the debanking of crypto businesses and executives as a result of pressure exerted during President Joe Biden’s administration by regulatory authorities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). After Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, the Chokepoint 2.0 ended as regulators reversed many of the directives put in place during the previous administration. JPMorgan accusation JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest U.S. banks, was singled out as an example. Under current U.S. law, specifically Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, consumers have a right to access their own financial data. But banks are now asserting control over how that data is delivered electronically, sometimes charging fees for access to information as basic as routing and account numbers. A16z’s executive argued that such tactics could make transferring funds to alternative platforms more costly, deterring users and reducing competition. “If it suddenly costs $10 to move $100 into a crypto account,” Rampell wrote, “maybe fewer people will do it. And if JPM and others can block consumers from connecting their own freely chosen crypto and fintech apps to their bank accounts, they effectively eliminate competition.” Rampell’s words echo those of Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, who said JPMorgan charging fintech platforms for access to customer banking data will “bankrupt” them. “This is the kind of egregious regulatory capture that kills innovation, hurts the American consumer, and is bad for America.” Read more: Winklevoss Claims JPMorgan Halted Gemini Onboarding After Data Access Fees Criticism JPMorgan hasn’t address the platform directly, but did address the criticism. The bank told Forbes that nearly 2 billion monthly requests for user data come from third parties, and that by charging fees it aims to curb misuse. Rampell, meanwhile, is calling on the Trump administration to stop such practices by the banks before they become standard among the rest of the financial institutions. ""In a perfect world, consumers would vote with their wallets. But every bank will likely do this, and getting a new banking charter takes years. Many banks have hostages, not customers,"" Rampell said. ""We don’t need a new law; we just need the administration to prevent this callous and manipulative attempt to kill competition and consumer choice,"" he added.",Finance|JPMorgan|Andreessen horowit|Crypto|Fintech|Operation Chokepoint|News,EN,0,big bank making harder expensive consumer use fintech crypto apps amount could seen operation chokepoint according alex rampell general partner venture capital firm andreessen horowitz latest fintech newsletter rampell pointed traditional financial institution charging high fee access account data move money particularly service like coinbase robinhood move strangle competition biden administration operation chokepoint tried debank deplatform crypto rampell said era ended bank aiming implement chokepoint charging insanely high fee access data move money crypto fintech apps concerningly blocking crypto fintech apps like added chokepoint refers specifically debanking crypto business executive result pressure exerted president joe biden administration regulatory authority like federal deposit insurance corp fdic donald trump elected president chokepoint ended regulator reversed many directive put place previous administration jpmorgan accusation jpmorgan chase one largest bank singled example current law specifically section act consumer right access financial data bank asserting control data delivered electronically sometimes charging fee access information basic routing account number executive argued tactic could make transferring fund alternative platform costly deterring user reducing competition suddenly cost move crypto account rampell wrote maybe fewer people jpm others block consumer connecting freely chosen crypto fintech apps bank account effectively eliminate rampell word echo gemini tyler winklevoss said jpmorgan charging fintech platform access customer banking data bankrupt kind egregious regulatory capture kill innovation hurt american consumer bad read winklevoss claim jpmorgan halted gemini onboarding data access fee criticism jpmorgan address platform directly address criticism bank told forbes nearly billion monthly request user data come third party charging fee aim curb misuse rampell meanwhile calling trump administration stop practice bank become standard among rest financial institution perfect world consumer would vote wallet every bank likely getting new banking charter take year many bank hostage customer rampell said need new law need administration prevent callous manipulative attempt kill competition consumer choice added,0.124,0.789,0.087,-0.9282,0

2025-08-02 18:00:20,49433273,1754157620,3 Key Ethena (ENA) Support Levels To Monitor – Analyst,"Ethena (ENA) prices are presently in the red zone during a broader crypto market correction. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the DeFi token recorded a significant 2.00% loss in the past day, with prices presently set hovering around $0.55. Amidst this price decline, top market analyst Ali Martinez has identified the major support regions that investors should monitor in the event of any further price retracement. Related Reading: Ethereum Drops 6% After Hitting $3,800, But Analysts See New ATH Ahead Ethena CBD Shows Key Price Floors At $0.47, $0.44, And $0.35 According to Martinez, the cost basis distribution (CBD) model has revealed the three short-term relevant support zones in the ENA market. For context, the CBD model is an on-chain framework that visualizes the amount of tokens accumulated at various price levels. It is used to identify important price zones, i.e., potential support or resistance levels, based on their registered volumes of accumulation. In the chart above, it is observed that the more intense (warmer) the color, the higher the greater supply concentration of ENA at that level. Based on this system, it can be inferred that the immediate support levels for ENA currently lie around $0.44 and $0.47, where significant price clusters have been formed in the last month. However, if a compelling selling pressure forces the ENA price below this support zone, investors should anticipate the next price halt around $0.35. This price region is presently the strongest support in the Ethena market, as shown by the deepest red horizontal bar on the CBD model, which represents an estimated $1 billion ENA supply cluster. Notably, a price crash to the $0.35 support zone indicates a potential estimated 37.5% loss from current prices. Meanwhile, the CBD model also reveals that ENA’s next price resistance sits around the $0.60, at which lies the next immediate cluster above the spot price. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) DeFi TVL Rises Nearly 40% Following Octane Upgrade Ethena Price Outlook At the time of writing, ENA trades at $0.57, reflecting a 2.08% decline in the last 24 hours as earlier stated. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 2.05% indicating a slight rise in market engagement and transaction volume. According to CoinCodex, investor sentiment remains strongly bullish, with 67% of the past month’s trading days closing in the green. Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index sits at 65, reflecting a relatively strong appetite for risk among investors. However, Coincodex analysts hold a cautious market view with predictions of $0.46 and $0.45 in the next five and 30 days, respectively. Meanwhile, their long-term forecast project ENA to also trade around $0.46 in the next three months.

2025-08-02 18:00:09,49433226,1754157609,"SHIB Falls, SOL Slows, and Spartans Gains: Why the Crypto Market Is Shifting Toward Utility","While parts of the crypto market face hesitation, some tokens are creating concern rather than confidence. Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 7% after a 5-trillion token transfer from Coinbase, raising questions about a possible selloff or supply crunch. Solana touched $200 briefly but could not stay there, with weak signals pointing to a drop toward $185. Both tokens are raising doubts among holders. At the same time, Spartans.com is moving forward. With 5,963 games and crypto-only support for casino and sports betting, Spartans is emerging as one of the top crypto betting platforms. While SHIB and SOL face strong resistance, more users are turning to platforms that offer real value now instead of waiting for prices to recover. Spartans meets that demand directly. Large SHIB Transfer Creates Confusion in the Market A 5-trillion SHIB token transfer, worth close to $70 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet has left Shiba Inu watchers unsettled. The token dropped 7% and trades near $0.00001407, showing increased tension. Some see it as a bearish sign ahead of more selling. Others think it may lead to a supply squeeze if demand picks up. The technical data is mixed. SHIB faces resistance at $0.00001435, with room to rise to $0.000018 or even $0.000026 if momentum returns. The CMF and RSI show the token is still active. But a 36% fall in active SHIB addresses in two days suggests users are stepping back. While the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price reaction could move higher if shorts get cleared out, the large transfer has made the market uneasy. For now, SHIB’s short-term path depends on how major holders and regular users react to the shift. Solana Pullback Signals Market Uncertainty Solana’s latest move has created more doubt than strength. It briefly passed $200 but fell to $192.57, unable to hold its gain. Technical readings show ADX at 15.49, a sign of a weak trend. Supertrend and Parabolic SAR also point to a likely pullback to $185 or even $171.73. Still, it is not all negative. If Solana can regain strength and close above key resistance, a rally toward $242.57 is still possible. But for now, traders remain cautious about the Solana (SOL) price movement. Low strength and slowing momentum are blocking SOL’s climb at the moment. As that plays out, more users are turning to platforms that are based on usage, not just price action. Exploring Spartans: Where Utility Replaces Uncertainty In contrast to the ongoing price swings of crypto assets, Spartans.com offers clear value through direct use, fast performance, and steady activity. With 5,963 games including slots, blackjack, crash games, baccarat, roulette, and live game shows, it appeals to crypto users looking for more than market charts. There is no need for fiat or third-party steps. Everything runs on crypto for easy access. Spartans is now one of the leading crypto betting platforms and includes a full sportsbook for global events. Users can bet on football, basketball, UFC, tennis, and more, with real-time odds and live updates. Its betslip system is built for fast use, allowing players to go from watching to betting without delay. The site supports many cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, and ADA. Withdrawals are processed quickly without bank wait times. New users can claim a 300% bonus for casino and sports sections, while regular players benefit from a 25% daily deposit bonus. For those aiming higher, Spartans also runs a Lamborghini giveaway. Anyone can join by signing up, depositing, and taking part. That’s all it takes to enter. Spartans works on mobile without the need to install an app. It connects easily with wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet for smooth play anytime. In a market full of shifting trends and empty talk, Spartans offers one clear feature: using crypto for fun and rewards right away. Final Say With Shiba Inu (SHIB) showing signs of fear and Solana (SOL) unable to hold its gains, many in the crypto world are starting to look at value from a different angle. Projects with strong ideas are useful, but working products are even better. Spartans.com is already in that category, offering 5,963 games, fast crypto withdrawals, and a wide sportsbook that covers key global matches. It’s not just a promise for later. Spartans is working now and stands as one of the top crypto betting platforms. In a market like this, holding crypto is only part of the picture. Using it for real results matters too, and Spartans is one of the few platforms where that’s possible. It’s made for those who want returns now, without waiting for the next big rally to begin.

2025-08-02 18:00:00,49433944,1754157600,"Forget Cardano (ADA): Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) CoinMarketCap Debut Sparks One of the Fastest Current Presales, Analysts Predict 100x Before 2026","Cardano (ADA) has long been heralded as one of the most innovative cryptocurrencies in the blockchain space. But as its momentum slows, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is accelerating at breakneck speed, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts globally. Since its CoinMarketCap (CMC) debut , Ruvi AI has seen unprecedented presale success , with over 1 million tokens sold daily and 70% of Phase 2 completed in record time. With analysts forecasting a potential 100x return before 2026 , Ruvi AI is shaping up to be the must-watch token of the year. Combined with its innovative blend of blockchain and AI , audited security, and an upcoming 33% price increase , now is the time for investors to take notice. How CoinMarketCap Boosted Ruvi AI’s Success CoinMarketCap isn’t just a platform, it’s a seal of legitimacy in the crypto world. A listing on CMC brings immediate validation , global exposure, and credibility. For Ruvi AI, this milestone launch put the token on the map, propelling it into a frenzy of investor interest. Numbers Show Explosive Growth 1 Million Tokens Sold Daily: Demand for Ruvi AI is accelerating like no other presale in 2025. 70% of Phase 2 Completed: Over 210 million tokens have already been claimed. $2.6 Million Raised: A testament to Ruvi AI’s growing popularity among retail and institutional buyers alike. Phase 2 is ending soon, and the token price will rise from $0.015 to $0.020, a 33% increase. Investors sitting on the sidelines risk being priced out of one of the fastest-growing opportunities in crypto. Why Ruvi AI Outshines Cardano Cardano has built its reputation on scalability and long-term vision, but Ruvi AI offers something Cardano doesn’t , immediate utility and practical, AI-driven solutions. By combining real-world applications with blockchain architecture , Ruvi AI is primed for both rapid adoption and sustained growth. What Makes Ruvi AI Unique? 1. Cutting-Edge AI Integration Ruvi AI doesn’t rely solely on speculative value. Its platform delivers AI-powered tools that help businesses optimize marketing, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency. These solutions give Ruvi AI a distinct advantage, making it more than just a token. 2. Blockchain-Powered Payment Systems Ruvi AI solves one of the gig economy’s biggest frustrations, unreliable payments. Freelancers, influencers, and creators benefit from secure, instant, and transparent payment systems , which deliver trust and accuracy at scale. 3. Cross-Industry Versatility While Cardano focuses on blockchain advancements, Ruvi AI applies its technology across various sectors, including healthcare, education, finance, and entertainment. This adaptability ensures it caters to a broad range of users, giving it massive global appeal. VIP Bonuses Deliver Unbeatable ROI One of the key drivers behind Ruvi AI’s presale frenzy is its tiered VIP bonus system , which rewards early investors with unparalleled returns. VIP 2 ($750 Investment): Secures 50,000 tokens at $0.015 each plus a 40% bonus , adding 20,000 extra tokens for a total of 70,000 tokens. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, this investment turns into $70,000, a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 Investment): Provides 100,000 tokens plus a 60% bonus , adding another 60,000 tokens for a total of 160,000 tokens. At $1, this transforms into $160,000, a remarkable 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 Investment): Awards 500,000 tokens and doubles holdings with a 100% bonus (an additional 500,000 tokens) for a total of 1 million tokens. When valued at $1, this becomes an incredible $1 million, an awe-inspiring 13,233% ROI. Leaderboard Rewards Create Additional Incentives Ruvi AI’s leaderboard system adds extra perks, offering top contributors up to 500,000 bonus tokens . For major investors, these rewards make participation even more lucrative. Built on Trust and Security While many tokens rely on hype alone, Ruvi AI emphasizes trust and reliability, underpinned by a comprehensive CyberScope audit. CyberScope Audit Highlights Tamper-Proof Smart Contracts: Designed to safeguard investor funds against vulnerabilities or manipulation. Transparent Blockchain Framework: Every transaction can be traced, fostering accountability and trust. This commitment to security ensures that Ruvi AI is not only set for growth but grounded in safety, a key differentiator in today’s volatile market. Why Timing Is Critical With over 1 million tokens selling daily and Phase 2 coming to an end, the opportunity to buy Ruvi AI at $0.015 is quickly evaporating. The 33% price hike to $0.020 marks a turning point, solidifying its status as one of the fastest-growing presales in crypto history. Analysts predicting 100x returns before 2026 only add urgency to Ruvi AI’s momentum. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting out, this is the kind of early-stage opportunity that could change everything. Don’t settle for lagging projects. Instead, capitalize on Ruvi AI’s explosive rise and secure your stake in the next big thing before it’s too late. Act now and join the wave reshaping cryptocurrency’s future.

2025-08-02 17:50:00,49433494,1754157000,"After Binance Coin (BNB), Here Are 4 More Cryptos Set to Skyrocket to Record Highs and Deliver Huge Gains","As Binance Coin (BNB) records consistent profits in the crypto market, four other cryptocurrencies are in the spotlight. These are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and the emerging presale project, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), all of which have the potential to perform well before Q4. Shiba Inu Shows Renewed Strength Over the past 30 days, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a 26% price increase. The token began July at about $0.00001133 and surged to $0.000016 before a slight correction. Currently, SHIB trades at $0.00001435 with a market cap of $8.46 billion and a daily volume of $192.5 million. Analysts believe SHIB could triple in value before Q4, supported by positive market sentiment. In addition, the continued growth of the ecosystem and community involvement are factors that drive its growth. It has been performing better than other meme coins in the recent past, which has led to new investor interest. Solana Gains Institutional Momentum Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $194 and trying to surpass its earlier 2021 high of $294. In recent weeks, the network has registered consistent institutional inflows. Increased developer activity, alongside a strong DeFi and NFT presence, has positioned Solana as a key infrastructure layer in the ecosystem. It now supports over 1,000 projects. Also, Solana has a special Proof of History consensus mechanism, which provides high throughput of more than 50,000 transactions per second. This gives it an advantage in performance compared to its rivals. Furthermore, the possibility of a Solana ETF has sparked additional optimism among retail and institutional buyers. XRP Benefits from Regulatory Progress XRP is among the best-performing large-cap assets, rising by 450% over the last year. The relative legal clarity of Ripple has enabled the project to extend its cross-border payment focus. The continued adoption of RippleNet by financial institutions has made XRP relevant in real-world utility. Major financial actors are still interested in the potential of the token in terms of banking integrations. In addition, its contribution to international settlements has been enhanced as lawsuits are relaxed. Investors are awaiting indications of a complete recovery in the XRP price in Q3 and Q4. Also, as the regulations and use-case adoption improve, XRP will be able to restore long-term investor confidence. Little Pepe Presale Generates Rapid Interest Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is currently in Stage 8 of its presale, priced at $0.0017 per token. Over $13.12 million has been raised, surpassing expectations. More than 9.4 billion tokens have already been sold. The presale is nearing its $13.7 million target, with Stage 9 priced at $0.0018. Additionally, the project has launched a $777,000 giveaway during the presale, rewarding ten investors with $77,000 each. One has to invest at least $100 to join. Little Pepe is an Ethereum Layer 2 chain, which allows inexpensive and rapid transactions and future compatibility with decentralized applications. It includes a sniper bot shield to protect presale and post-launch participants from automated trading. No extra taxes or fees are charged on trades, allowing users full access to their tokens. Furthermore, staking is available for holders seeking passive income, and a DAO system is in place for community governance and voting. The project has plans for a meme token launchpad to support new meme-based crypto assets. It also plans to release NFTs, cross-chain tools, and more DeFi features in the future. Conclusion As Binance Coin is still on the rise, SHIB, SOL, XRP, and, in particular, Little Pepe have high upside potential. Little Pepe has real blockchain infrastructure, fast presale development, and progressive features. Investors are making early bets as the token approaches its hard cap, hoping to see a breakout.

The proceeds are expected to support the commercial rollout of Mistral’s chatbot and further improve its LLMs. Since its inception in 2023, Mistral has positioned itself as an alternative to U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google. The company’s LLMs are designed to be modular and accessible, allowing users to adapt the models to their unique needs. Since its last fundraising in June 2024, when it raised €600M, Mistral is now on track to exceed $100M in annual revenue if its current sales momentum holds. That growth has been largely driven by a few high-value enterprise contracts. Current customers of the company include BNP Paribas, AXA, and CMA CGM, whose billionaire owner Rodolphe Saadé is also a supporter of the startup. Mistral’s investor base also includes Lightspeed Venture Partners, General Catalyst, France’s public investment bank BPI France, and telecom magnate Xavier Niel. Europe wants its own sovereign AI French President Emmanuel Macron has been an advocate for the development of a “sovereign” European AI, and Mistral is widely considered the region’s best shot at building such a capability. However, U.S. rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic have set a high bar in technological scale and fundraising. Mistral’s $10B target, while impressive for a two-year-old start-up, shows the gap between the company and U.S. industry leaders. The firm’s emphasis on openness and model customization places it in competition with Meta’s Llama models and China’s Deepseek, both of which are pushing modular and freely accessible AI tools. In May, the company announced its plans to build a large-scale data center outside Paris as part of its long-term strategy to support AI model training and deployment. The new capital could help progress this data center effort, increasing Mistral’s capacity to scale its models and serve a bigger customer base.

2025-08-02 17:30:52,49432026,1754155852,Stellar (XLM) Price Performance Surge & NEAR Protocol Rally Highlight Cold Wallet at $0.00942 as Top Crypto to Buy,"The recent Stellar (XLM) price performance surge and the Near Protocol (NEAR) price rally show one thing clearly: the market still values real use cases and visible growth. Stellar is holding gains after one of its most impressive monthly performances, while NEAR is picking up pace with notable trading volume and ecosystem expansion. But if you’re analyzing options for the top crypto to buy in 2025, it might be time to focus on how everyday crypto usage could become a revenue stream. You’re already paying fees and moving assets. Cold Wallet ($CWT) turns those actions into rewards through its token CWT, currently available at $0.00942, with much higher upside potential ahead. Cold Wallet Makes Holding CWT More Rewarding Every Day Every transaction costs money, swaps, gas, and transfers. Cold Wallet challenges that cost model. Its token, CWT, gives you back a portion of those fees without the need for staking, contracts, or waiting periods. Just hold CWT and get rewards as you use the wallet. This makes it one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025 for users who want more than passive price exposure. The presale structure is built for growth. CWT is currently priced at $0.00942, marking the entry point in a 150-stage process that concludes with a launch price of $0.35171. Analysts suggest a path to $2 after the token hits exchanges, offering early participants a chance at returns up to 285x. What’s more, the model doesn’t just focus on numbers; it builds a reward-driven wallet experience. Holding more CWT boosts your cashback tier, with the top level offering a full 100% gas rebate. Rather than betting on future hype, it delivers a functioning product that pays users for activity. For those planning ahead, this is more than buying into a token. It’s gaining access to an ecosystem built with user alignment from the beginning. And with the presale live now, Cold Wallet presents a clear opportunity for those evaluating the top crypto to buy in 2025 before wider attention arrives. Stellar (XLM) Price Surge Reflects July Strength The Stellar (XLM) price performance at the end of July continues to attract attention. After rising between 75% and 85% in one month, it’s now trading near $0.44 following a brief pullback. From $0.424 on July 24 to $0.442, Stellar is finding support near $0.39 and resistance in the $0.46 to $0.52 range. Analysts are watching closely, with targets as high as $0.71 possible if favourable market conditions continue, and even $1 is being mentioned as a longer-term goal. From a technical perspective, Stellar remains in a positive position. It trades above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, while its RSI of 62 shows sustainable buying pressure. Although the MACD points to slight bearish divergence, many traders see this as a period of consolidation before a potential upward breakout. The key is whether XLM can breach resistance and extend July’s momentum into the new month. Near Protocol’s Rally Builds on Ecosystem Growth The Near Protocol (NEAR) price rally since July 25 has captured attention, with the token jumping from $2.61 to $2.79 within a single session. This move was supported by growing institutional demand and increased trading volume. NEAR even hit $2.97 before pulling back to $2.67 as the wider altcoin market cooled. Resistance now sits between $2.83 and $2.90, while support is holding around $2.61, with lower support at $2.11 and $1.79. These levels reflect short-term volatility following a bigger rally earlier in July, which was fueled by new partnerships, including one with Everclear. Technically, NEAR shows mixed signals. It’s trading above its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages but remains under its 200-day SMA at $2.95, a level it must retake to maintain momentum. The RSI is near 53, signalling neutral territory, while MACD trends show light bearish divergence. A move above $2.90, if accompanied by volume, could confirm this rally as the start of a longer trend rather than a temporary spike. Key Insights The Stellar (XLM) price performance surge and the Near Protocol (NEAR) price rally both reflect strong technicals and real development progress. Stellar is steady around $0.44 after its best month in years, and NEAR continues its attempt to push beyond $2.90, helped by solid fundamentals. Still, for those looking beyond trading swings, Cold Wallet introduces a different value proposition. CWT, priced at $0.00942 in its early presale, is built to reward users for every gas fee, bridge, and swap, converting regular activity into real income. With a presale at $0.00942 in stage 16, a set launch price of $0.35171, and $2 projections, the case for early involvement is strong. Anyone researching the top crypto to buy in 2025 should consider that Cold Wallet is already active, rewarding, and still flying under the radar. The real question is who will recognise its utility before it hits wider adoption.

2025-08-02 17:30:00,49433625,1754155800,"Cold Wallet, ENA, PENGU, & LTC: The Top Crypto Assets Everyone’s Rushing Into This Month","Some coins are popping just from the buzz. But others? They’re moving because they’ve built real momentum. With crypto markets turning up again, it’s not just hype that’s winning; it’s the tokens with actual use cases. While the noise gets louder, a few names are quietly pulling in volume and fresh attention fast. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) is flipping the script on wallets. ENA is gaining serious traction in DeFi. PENGU’s got its meme power dialed in with strong buying pressure. LTC is showing it’s still got a major role in real-world transfers. These are the top crypto assets gaining ground right now. Here’s why buyers are jumping in before prices run higher. 1. Cold Wallet: A Live Wallet That Actually Pays You Cold Wallet isn’t just selling a dream; it’s already working. This wallet rewards every move you make with CWT. Gas? Swap? Ramp? You get cashback for it. And the more CWT you hold, the more rewards you earn. Diamond tier users can get up to 100% cashback on gas and 50% on swaps, no staking, no waiting. It’s live now and delivering daily. The presale price? Just $0.00942. That’s the floor, its confirmed listing price is $0.35171, and it’s expected to hit over $2 as adoption builds. That’s over 212x potential from this early stage. The presale spans 150 price stages, and 40% of the total supply is allocated here. Another 25% is locked for ongoing user rewards. Plus, you get a 10% referral bonus in CWT when you share it, and your invitees get 5% too. This isn’t just another coin; it’s a working product with built-in value on every action. That’s why Cold Wallet is topping the list of top crypto assets to get into now. With the price still at $0.00942, the window to move early is still wide open. 2. PENGU: Meme Energy With Real Momentum PENGU is no longer just a meme; it’s moving with purpose. Priced near $0.000186, it’s all over crypto feeds thanks to real volume and active buyers. Coordinated campaigns, burns, and steady community pushes have kept it in the spotlight and built serious pressure under the chart. What makes PENGU stand out right now? It’s consistent. Where other meme coins fade fast, PENGU is rolling out updates, building a roadmap, and teasing features like staking and community games. That combo of low price and strong engagement is drawing in meme traders looking for something with staying power. It’s earned a spot among the top crypto assets by turning hype into movement. 3. ENA: DeFi Traction That’s Picking Up Speed Ethena (ENA) is grabbing attention across DeFi, and the price is starting to reflect that shift. It’s trading at around $0.64, with steady upward momentum thanks to growing use of its synthetic dollar and staking tools. With capital-efficient yield strategies, ENA appeals to both big and small DeFi users. That’s keeping the volume up and the chart trending. What’s helping ENA move fast is its expanding reach, new integrations with key protocols and exchanges are placing it right in the center of DeFi’s rebound. Its total value locked (TVL) has surged in the past month. This isn’t a flash-in-the-pan project. ENA is retaining users and pulling in new capital. Even without cashback features, the price trend alone makes it one of this month’s top crypto assets worth watching. 4. LTC: Not Flashy, But Still Moving Big Money Litecoin (LTC) is showing why older coins shouldn’t be counted out. It’s currently trading around $93 and aiming to break back above $100. Recent jumps in activity show it’s still a go-to for cross-border payments and fast, low-fee transfers. It may not dominate headlines, but its usage numbers say plenty. What keeps LTC relevant? Reliability. While meme tokens rise and fall, LTC stays in the game with consistent speed and confirmed network performance. And now that transaction volumes are on the rise across crypto, LTC is seeing a bump in real usage. It may not promise wild gains, but for many traders, that stability makes it one of the top crypto assets to keep in rotation this cycle. These Projects Are Rising for Real Reasons Each coin here is gaining traction not from speculation, but from real use, real upgrades, and growing activity. SHIB and PEPE may light up meme feeds, but Cold Wallet, ENA, PENGU, and LTC are giving buyers more to work with. From cashback systems to DeFi tools, community growth, and dependable utility, these projects are delivering. Cold Wallet leads the charge by turning crypto fees into rewards, all while priced at just $0.00942. ENA is turning heads in the DeFi space. PENGU is proving that memes with structure can run. LTC is showing that classic coins still drive value. If you’re eyeing the top crypto assets to move into before the next breakout, this list offers a powerful mix of early access and proven delivery.

2025-08-02 17:10:10,49431208,1754154610,Anthropic’s Bold Move: Revoking OpenAI’s Claude AI Access,"BitcoinWorld Anthropic’s Bold Move: Revoking OpenAI’s Claude AI Access In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovation and rivalry often go hand-in-hand, a significant development has sent ripples across the industry. Leading AI firm Anthropic has made a decisive move, reportedly revoking access for its competitor, OpenAI , to its advanced Claude AI models. This action, stemming from alleged violations of Anthropic’s terms of service, highlights the intensifying AI competition and raises crucial questions about data usage, proprietary technology, and the future trajectory of foundational AI models like GPT-5 . What Sparked the Dispute? Unpacking Anthropic’s Stance The core of this escalating dispute, as reported by Wired, centers on how OpenAI was allegedly utilizing Anthropic’s Claude AI models. Sources indicate that OpenAI had been integrating Claude into its internal tools. This integration reportedly allowed OpenAI to benchmark Claude’s performance against its own proprietary models across various critical categories, including coding, writing, and safety protocols. For Anthropic , this was a direct breach of their commercial terms, which explicitly prohibit companies from leveraging Claude to develop competing services. An Anthropic spokesperson elaborated on their position, stating, “OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5 .” This particular detail suggests a strategic move by OpenAI to gain insights into a rival’s capabilities, potentially informing the development of their next-generation model. Such competitive intelligence gathering, while common in many industries, crosses a line when it violates contractual agreements designed to protect intellectual property and market advantage. OpenAI’s Response: A Glimpse into the Future of AI Competition In response to Anthropic’s decision, an OpenAI spokesperson expressed disappointment, noting, “While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.” This statement underscores the complex dynamics of the AI ecosystem, where companies are both competitors and, at times, reluctant collaborators through API access. OpenAI’s sentiment suggests a desire for continued reciprocal access, perhaps for their own benchmarking or research purposes, even as they develop their own powerful models. This incident is not an isolated one in the history of AI competition . It echoes previous instances where Anthropic has shown reluctance to provide access to competitors. Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan previously justified cutting off Windsurf (a rumored OpenAI acquisition target, later acquired by Cognition) by remarking, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” This consistent stance highlights Anthropic’s commitment to protecting its technological edge and preventing direct competitive exploitation of its models. The Core of the Conflict: Terms of Service and the Race for GPT-5 The crux of the matter lies in the delicate balance between open innovation and proprietary protection. While many AI companies offer API access to foster development and expand their reach, they also embed strict terms of service to prevent misuse, especially by direct competitors. Anthropic’s terms are clear: using Claude AI to build competing services is forbidden. OpenAI’s alleged actions, particularly in the context of their impending GPT-5 launch, appear to have directly contravened these terms. This situation brings to light several critical aspects: Proprietary Technology vs. Open Access: The tension between making powerful AI models accessible via API and safeguarding core intellectual property from competitive exploitation. Benchmarking Ethics: The ethical boundaries of using a competitor’s product for internal benchmarking, especially when it might inform the development of a directly competing product. The Race for Next-Gen Models: The fierce urgency among leading AI labs to develop and launch superior models like GPT-5 , driving intense competitive behavior. This incident serves as a stark reminder that as AI capabilities advance, so too will the complexities of business relationships, legal frameworks, and ethical considerations within the industry. Implications for the AI Landscape: What’s Next for Claude AI and OpenAI? The immediate consequence is a potential reduction in data points for OpenAI’s internal comparisons, which might slightly impact their development insights. However, the broader implications extend beyond just these two companies. This dispute sets a precedent for how major AI players might interact and protect their innovations going forward. It could lead to: Stricter API Terms: Other AI providers might review and tighten their API access terms to prevent similar situations. Increased Internal Development: Companies might invest more heavily in developing their own comprehensive internal benchmarking tools and less on relying on competitor APIs. Consolidation or Divergence: The industry could see further consolidation through acquisitions (like Cognition acquiring Windsurf) or a more pronounced divergence, with companies building walled gardens around their unique AI capabilities. For developers and businesses relying on these powerful models, such disputes highlight the importance of understanding the underlying terms of service and diversifying their AI toolchains to mitigate risks associated with sudden access revocations. Conclusion: A New Chapter in AI Competition The decision by Anthropic to revoke OpenAI ‘s access to its Claude AI models marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing AI competition . It underscores the intense rivalry driving innovation in the sector and the lengths to which companies will go to protect their competitive advantages.

2025-08-02 17:09:21,49432208,1754154561,"ADA bearish reversal signals drop below $0.70, but traders are positioning with MUTM","Cardano (ADA) has slipped below the $0.70 support level, flashing strong bearish reversal signals that have investors treading cautiously. However, while the broader altcoin market faces headwinds, a wave of optimism is quietly building around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol capturing trader attention for its real-world asset lending infrastructure. Over 14,700 investors have already put their money in the project, with Mutuum Finance having raised more than $13.8 million so far. The project is currently at Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, an increase of 16.67% from Presale Phase 5. The upcoming Phase 7 will also see a price increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Investors are now able to reap a 71.43% ROI when the token launches at $0.06. As ADA navigates technical resistance zones and the market recalibrates, savvy investors are starting to position for a potential breakout with Mutuum Finance, hinting at a strategic rotation in capital within the crypto market. Cardano (ADA) slides below $0.78 support amid bearish signals Cardano is currently trading at $0.78, having dropped from recent highs near $0.90 as momentum waned and a bearish head-and-shoulders reversal pattern materialized, signaling potential downward pressure toward $0.67–$0.70 if support does not hold. Despite the setback, technical outlooks remain mixed: while some models identify a short-term target within $0.75–$0.80, others suggest that a break below $0.78 could lead to deeper consolidation or further correction in Cardano’s price. As ADA navigates this critical zone, market focus is increasingly shifting toward emerging utility-driven DeFi tokens like Mutuum Finance. Dual-lending system by Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an active and passive users’ lending platform in DeFi. Passive income is generated from lending USDT in stable passive income-generating smart contract pools. Aside from that, MUTM allows lenders and borrowers to swap as much as they want with no intermediaries. That is usually the case with users who deal with less stable assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale now live Following the complete sell-out of its Phase 5 presale, Mutuum Finance has brought online Phase 6, and the tokens are now priced at $0.035, which represents a rise of 16.17% from the previous round. The next price cap is $0.04, a 14.29% rise. Earliest investors at this level may realize a 71.43% return once MUTM is trading at $0.06. To date, the presale has raised over $13.8 million and attracted over 14,700 distinct investors, which speaks volumes about the project’s growing popularity. Secured by CertiK and a $50K bug bounty program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Aside from that, the project is certified by CertiK with a 95.0 trust score. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. It will be rated on a four-severity scale: critical, major, minor, and low. $100,000 in MUTM tokens available Mutuum Finance has started a $100,000 giveaway that will reward 10 winners with a total of $10,000 MUTM as gratitude for the investor’s initial trust in the project. Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of weakness, trading below $0.78 with bearish pressure mounting. As ADA struggles to hold support, investors are rotating into high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently priced at $0.035 in Presale Phase 6, MUTM will rise 14.29% to $0.04 in the next stage. The token launches at $0.06, locking in a 71.43% ROI for current buyers. Over 14,700 investors have joined so far, with $13.8 million+ raised. The project also features a USD-backed stablecoin, CertiK audit, $50K bug bounty, and a $100K giveaway. Secure your spot now before Phase 6 ends and the price jumps again.

The case is built on strong July price action, record ETF inflows, and a corporate supply squeeze. However, historical data shows Q3 is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year for Bitcoin. The crypto market is heading into the third quarter of 2025 with a powerfully bullish setup, but this momentum is on a collision course with a major historical headwind. While the July data brings in a show of a strong Q2 ending, Q3 has traditionally been the weakest quarter of the year for Bitcoin, setting the stage for a major test of the market’s conviction. July: Strong Gains and Record ETF Flows The bullish case for Q3 begins with the overall crypto market’s performance in July. Bitcoin especially delivered a strong 29.74% gain in Q2.

2025-08-02 17:07:45,49431661,1754154465,Berkshire Hathaway reported a 4% drop in Q2 operating earnings,"Berkshire Hathaway failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations again, reporting a second straight quarterly earnings drop. The company posted a 4% decline in operating profit for the second quarter of 2025, bringing in $11.16 billion, down from $11.6 billion in the same period last year. Berkshire blamed the dip on weaker underwriting results from its insurance units, which reversed last year’s record gains. Other sectors like railroads, energy, and retail did better, but not enough to pull the whole group up. Overall net income came in at $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, compared to $30.3 billion, or $21,122 per share, a year earlier. The drop in net earnings was partly due to changes in the value of the firm’s investments, which it must report under U.S. accounting rules, even when the assets haven’t been sold. Cash rises, but no share buybacks and no big deals At the same time earnings were falling, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash stash climbed to a record $344 billion by the end of June, up from $333 billion at the end of March. Despite having more than enough capital to make moves, Warren Buffett and his team didn’t use any of it to buy back shares. That made it the fourth straight quarter with no buybacks, even though the firm has said it will repurchase stock if the price drops below what Warren sees as fair value. Class A shares peaked at $809,350 on May 2, right before Warren said he’ll step down as CEO at the end of 2025. The stock ended June at $711,480, but still, there was no repurchase. Warren, 94, has been cautious in recent years. He hasn’t made a major acquisition, and his team has been selling stocks more than buying them. In the second quarter, Berkshire sold $6.92 billion in equities and bought $3.9 billion, continuing a trend that’s now stretched over 11 consecutive quarters. Warren explained his approach earlier this year in his annual letter to shareholders. “The great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change,” he wrote. Still, he hasn’t acted much on that preference lately. One reason may be rising prices. The S&P 500 jumped more than 10% during the second quarter and hit an all-time high by June. That made it harder to find good deals. Kraft Heinz is one of Warren’s worst bets Berkshire also took a $3.8 billion writedown on its Kraft Heinz Co. stake, slashing the carrying value of the holding to $8.4 billion from more than $17 billion back in 2017. Warren was the key player behind the merger of Kraft and Heinz nearly a decade ago, but the move hasn’t paid off. The packaged food giant’s stock has dropped 62% since the deal, while the S&P 500 has gained 202% in the same period. In its regulatory filing, Berkshire said the loss was “other-than-temporary” and explained: “Given these factors, as well as prevailing economic and other uncertainties, we concluded that the unrealized loss, represented by the difference between the carrying value of our investment and its fair value, was other-than-temporary.” Warren’s company still owns 27.4% of Kraft Heinz as of June, but the writedown may give them room to start reducing that position. Jim Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, said this may be a signal. “I think they’re giving themselves more flexibility to potentially exit their position in the future,” he said. “This is one of Warren’s largest missteps in the past couple of decades. It might just be time to move on from it.” Currency moves added more pain to this quarter’s results. Because Berkshire Hathaway holds some debt in euros, British pounds, and yen, those loans must be translated into dollars. In Q2, the weakening of the dollar led to an $877 million after-tax hit to earnings. A year ago, the same effect actually helped, adding $446 million in after-tax profit. Warren has long argued that operating earnings are the best way to measure the company’s real performance. Unrealized gains and losses from stocks can cause massive swings in net income from quarter to quarter, even when nothing’s been sold. That volatility was clear this quarter, with net income swinging by almost $18 billion compared to last year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-08-02 17:03:52,49432206,1754154232,"DOGE gains 30% in July, but market sentiment is starting to shift towards MUTM","In a month when Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied with an unexpected 30% surge, the spotlight is beginning to drift away from meme coins and shift toward tokens with real-world utility. One such rising coin is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol that’s quickly gaining traction among investors seeking substance over hype. As July’s market movements spark conversations around long-term value and practical application, Mutuum Finance stands out for its innovative approach to on-chain credit and sustainable DeFi infrastructure. The growing pivot toward utility-driven assets could signal a new phase in crypto investing, one where protocol purpose, borrower-lender ecosystems, and real-world use cases matter more than viral tweets. Dogecoin (DOGE) climbs 30% in July as focus shifts toward utility assets Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.24, up roughly 30% in July as it recovered from early‑month lows near $0.17. The token has rebounded strongly after breaking through resistance zones around $0.20–$0.22, forming a bullish double‑bottom structure supported by surging volume and renewed retail interest. Analysts highlight potential upside toward $0.30–$0.35 if DOGE sustains above $0.25–$0.26, with speculative technical targets ranging near $0.40 in optimistic scenarios. As meme-coin sentiment shows signs of peaking, some interest is shifting toward utility- and protocol-based tokens, like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale now live Mutuum Finance has already sold out presale phase 5 in record time and launched Phase 6 with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price adjustment will take the token up by a further 14.29% to $0.04, allowing existing joiners to stand to gain 71.43% when it finally comes out at $0.06. The presale has already pulled in over 14,800 investors and has raised over $13.9 million, a testimony to the confidence that the market has placed in the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: facilitating the future of DeFi Mutuum Finance takes a double-model approach to facilitating flexibility and effectiveness in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models of lending. Peer-to-Contract uses self-executing smart contracts that carry out the lending function autonomously with no intervention by human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate using dynamic rates in the market with an unknown rate of interest as guided by current demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and offers market to be in touch with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance reinforces commitment to stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to introduce a stablecoin that will be pegged to USD on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a secure and safe investment product to eradicate risk and volatility that could be associated with algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited Certik with a 95.0 trust score. This is a prestigious achievement in terms of the ambition of Mutuum Finance to be an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol. It also signifies that the team cares about staying compliant with the security standards of the industry. Mutuum Finance deploys $50K bug bounty to foster safety Mutuum Finance has introduced its Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. Four levels of severity are there under this program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. Therefore, all the possible bugs are found and rewarded. It aligns with the team’s vision of developing a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction fast. It’s currently in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035. The next phase will raise the price by 14.29% to $0.04. At launch, it’s set to list at $0.06, giving Phase 6 buyers a 71.43% ROI. So far, the project has raised $13.9 million+ and onboarded 14,800+ investors. Act now before Phase 6 ends.

SPX6900 Pulls Back, & Filecoin Holds Ground","Sectors are starting to stir with fresh momentum. The SPX6900 (SPX) price outlook has cooled slightly after tapping $2.27, though market signals remain active. Meanwhile, the Filecoin (FIL) price forecast shows resilience, with experts aiming at $3.18 by 2025 as it struggles to break the $2.94 resistance. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) has taken center stage in the presale space. Its recent viral demo showcased how pairing the X1 app with the X10 miner can dramatically raise daily earnings from 20 to 200 BDAG coins, igniting massive demand for BDAG mining devices. Sales of X-series miners have now exceeded $7.6 million, and the X1 app has surpassed 2.5 million active users. While many projects lag in user traction, BDAG is already delivering functionality. That momentum has people calling it the best crypto right now. SPX6900 (SPX) Price Outlook: Profit-Taking After Record High After peaking at $2.27, the SPX6900 (SPX) price outlook turned cautious, with the asset dipping to $2.22. Despite a 17.97% jump in open interest and a 92% spike in derivatives activity, netflow data shows more participants are locking in gains. Spot netflow rose to $1 million, and the stock-to-flow ratio fell noticeably, signaling an increase in circulating supply. For SPX6900 to maintain its bullish structure, demand needs to keep pace. RSI is at 71 and CMF at 0.13, both hinting at continued buying, but the price may still slide toward $1.93 if selling pressure grows. Filecoin (FIL) Price Forecast Holds Focus on $3.18 in 2025 Analysts project the Filecoin (FIL) price forecast to reach as high as $3.18 by late 2025, with an average price near $2.97. Currently priced at $2.78, FIL is showing strength, remaining above the 20-day SMA while testing the $2.94 resistance zone. The RSI sits at 62.36, indicating potential for more upward movement if market volume stays solid. On a shorter 4-hour chart, FIL is forming a narrow range between $2.67 and $2.80, with Bollinger Bands compressing. Until a breakout confirms direction, sideways movement remains likely before it targets the $3.00 zone. BlockDAG’s Miner Demo Sparks Unmatched Presale Demand Following the release of the recent X1 and X10 pairing demo, interest in BlockDAG’s mining hardware has surged. More than 18,861 X-series miners have already been purchased, and hardware sales now top $7.6 million, an exceptional feat for a presale project. The X1 app’s usage reflects real-world traction, with over 2.5 million users already mining. Unlike typical projects that promise future functionality, BlockDAG is already in action. That practical delivery is a major factor fueling its hype. The miner demo, which showed how pairing the X1 app with the X10 device boosts daily returns from 20 to 200 BDAG coins, has driven interest through the roof. Meanwhile, miner shipments have already begun for X30 and X100 units, and X10 deliveries are set to begin in August. BlockDAG’s presale has now pulled in more than $358 million, with 24.6 billion BDAG coins already sold. The current batch is Batch 29, priced at $0.0016 until August 11th. Since the start of the presale, early supporters have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds, indicating strong performance well before its official launch. Given its robust miner ecosystem, daily earnings potential, and growing user base, many see BDAG as the best crypto right now. The BEAT VESTING PASS offer has also been extended to August 4, giving buyers more time to secure maximum benefits. Final Say Indicators can give clues. The SPX6900 price outlook is eyeing a potential dip, while the Filecoin price forecast waits on a breakout confirmation. Yet BDAG is already taking steps others haven’t. With over 2.5 million active users and a demo event that’s already taken place, it’s not just planning success; it’s delivering it. More than $358 million raised, miners delivered, and a coin price of $0.0016 valid until August 11, these are real milestones. BlockDAG continues to position itself among the best crypto right now , not because it promises growth, but because it’s already showing results others are still hoping for.

2025-08-02 17:00:12,49430757,1754154012,No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst,"Reports have disclosed that XRP community commentator Versan Aljarrah says XRP could gain a link to gold without actually holding bullion. According to Aljarrah, XRP would simply move gold-backed stablecoins across the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert The commentator argues that this role would give XRP a “synthetic connection” to tokenized assets like gold and oil, even though XRP itself would not carry any gold reserves. How XRP Bridges Gold Token According to Aljarrah, XRP only needs to power the on-chain movement of gold-pegged coins. Based on reports, each gold token on the XRPL would represent one gram of real gold. Custodians such as MKS Pamp and Imperial Vaults would hold the physical bars. XRP would then step in to provide liquidity and settle trades on the ledger’s built-in exchange. Aljarrah sees this setup as a way for the altcoin to stay useful in global finance. $XRP doesn’t need to be backed by gold. It just needs to move it. When gold-pegged stablecoins live on $XRPL, XRP bridges them. And in doing so, it becomes synthetically linked to gold, oil, and every asset they tokenize. pic.twitter.com/q0Ti2pQuDp — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) July 27, 2025 Meld Gold Leads The Charge Meld Gold is the only issuer currently close to launching a gold token on the XRPL. Reports have disclosed that Meld plans to back each token with one gram of physical gold. The firm says it will work with major vault operators. So far, no other gold token projects, including PAX Gold (PAXG), have moved onto XRP’s network. Supporters hope that more issuers will follow once Meld proves the concept. Technical And Regulatory Hurdles Reports note that issuing gold tokens is more than writing code. Each issuer must tie its token to audits, legal contracts and insured vaults. On top of that, XRP’s fixed supply and decentralized consensus system make direct asset backing tricky. Matt Hamilton, a former Ripple developer, has said the crypto asset can’t be backed by gold in a traditional way. Analysts add that its price moves with adoption, legal clarity and market mood, not by hype. Institutional Moves Remain Unseen Meanwhile, Aljarrah says big names like JPMorgan, BlackRock, the Bank for International Settlements and the IMF have made private plans to use XRP as a bridge. Yet no public evidence supports that claim. Related Reading: XRP ETF Approval Incoming? Analyst Eyes September-October Window Most large asset managers have focused on blockchains with clear rules. Until the Ripple-SEC lawsuit ends, top institutions are likely to hold back. That case could decide if XRP is treated like a security, and that will affect any tokenized assets on the XRPL. According to analysis, a bridge role alone won’t peg XRP’s price to the spot gold rate of $2,950 that some in the community mention. Instead, if gold-pegged tokens take off, the altcoin could see more trading volume and tighter spreads. That might nudge its price upward, but it would still trade on its own merits as a liquidity tool for cross-border payments.

2025-08-02 17:00:02,49430873,1754154002,"FET Jumps from $0.70, VeChain Targets $0.05 After BitGo News, BlockDAG’s X1 App Reaches 2.5M Users After Viral Demo","Some crypto updates are catching attention fast, and FET, VeChain, and BlockDAG are right at the center. The latest FET price analysis shows the token rising after bouncing from $0.70, supported by steady wallet activity and strong price expectations. The VeChain (VET) price outlook is also improving after the network revealed a new deal with BitGo, a well-known regulated custodian. Plans are underway for tokenized products and DeFi services, hinting at a possible breakout for VET. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its mobile-focused mining demo featuring the X1 and X10 has gone viral. It shows users how X1 rewards could grow ten times with simple steps. With the $0.0016 rate ending soon and $0.05 as the listing price, more users are entering early. These are the crypto coins to watch right now, but which one stands out most? Let’s take a closer look. FET Shows Strength After Bounce from $0.70 In the most recent FET price analysis, the token shows clear signs of growth after rebounding from $0.70 support. Quiet buying from key wallets suggests rising confidence, and predictions now point to $0.79 this month and possibly $1.04 before the year ends. Some even see room for $2.85 with stronger adoption. A big part of this interest comes from the ASI Pulse update, which introduced new AI tools to handle tasks like energy tracking and trading. With rising AI support and staking rewards between 10% and 15%, FET is gaining attention. Based on this FET price analysis, momentum and real-world use could push prices higher in the months ahead. VeChain Eyes Growth After BitGo Announcement VeChain’s partnership with BitGo is raising hopes for broader use. BitGo will offer regulated storage and staking, helping VeChain move into tokenized markets and DeFi, which could also draw interest from institutions. The update sent VET to $0.0255 before a slight drop to $0.0249. Some sold to take profits, but this move is still seen as progress for long-term plans. The VeChain (VET) price outlook now suggests it could reach $0.05 if momentum holds. With support near $0.024, the chance of another upward move remains. X1 App Pushes BlockDAG to 2.5M Users as Demo Goes Viral BlockDAG’s recent X1-X10 mining demo has quickly gained attention, and for good reason. The X1 app is already known as one of the top mobile mining tools, giving users a simple way to collect BDAG directly on their smartphones. The app is just 50 MB in size, runs on Android and iOS, and uses very little battery, allowing up to 20 BDAG to be mined each day. Now, the new X10 demo adds a big upgrade. BlockDAG showed how users can connect the X1 app to a small device called the X10 miner. It’s about the size of a Wi-Fi extender and connects using Bluetooth. This setup increases daily mining up to 200 BDAG from home. This earnings boost comes at a key time. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29, which is only available until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. Once it goes live, the price will be listed at $0.05, showing a possible 3,025% return. The project has already gained major traction, with more than 2.5 million users, a presale total of $359 million, and over 24.6 billion coins sold. Since the X1 app is free to use, the chance to mine without any upfront cost adds even more value. But as the GLOBAL LAUNCH release gets closer, many think the time left to mine at these levels is shrinking. As more users join, individual rewards may drop. Right now may be the best time to mine, collect, and get ready ahead of launch. Final Say FET and VeChain are both showing strong signs as top crypto coins to watch this altseason. The latest FET price analysis points to rising momentum, with price targets moving closer to $1 and possibly higher. At the same time, the VeChain (VET) price outlook has turned more positive after the project announced a new partnership with BitGo. With plans for regulated custody and tokenized products, VeChain is building a case for long-term relevance. BlockDAG, however, is moving on its own path. With BDAG priced at $0.0016 and a $0.05 listing confirmed, early access brings the chance for a 3,025% return at launch. The X1 app adds more value, allowing users to mine up to 200 BDAG daily. With more than 2.5 million users already active, the time to take part may be running out. BlockDAG is no longer just about what could happen. It is already showing results, and this phase might be the moment to act before the pace picks up.

2025-08-02 16:55:48,49431476,1754153748,Pepe Coin price prediction: PEPE strength starts to fade as MUTM gains ground in Q3,"As Q3 unfolds, a noticeable shift is emerging in the crypto market, while Pepe Coin (PEPE) begins to show signs of fatigue after its viral-driven surge, investor attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol gaining rapid traction. Bolstered by growing investor interest and a sharp uptick in buy activity, Mutuum Finance is carving a niche with its lending model, attracting attention from both retail and institutional players. With momentum building around its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance could be quietly positioning itself as one of the most impactful DeFi projects of the quarter, just as older meme coins begin to lose their spark. Pepe Coin (PEPE) momentum fizzles as technical strength weakens Pepe Coin is currently trading around $0.0000124, down roughly 7–9% over the past 24 hours and about 8–14% over the past week, following a broader pullback in meme coin sentiment and rising bearish indicators. While the token broke out from a falling wedge earlier in July, sparking hopes for a 50% rally toward $0.000015–$0.0000178, recent momentum has cooled, with on-chain data pointing to selling pressure and weakening indicators like MACD and RSI. Analysts caution that failure to hold the $0.0000120–$0.0000121 support zone could open the door to a decline to $0.0000105–$0.0000110, marking a shift from speculative strength toward consolidation risk. Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale promises 71% ROI Mutuum Finance is at $0.035 in presale stage 6 due to an early sell-out for presale stage 5. Phase 6 investors will enjoy a 71.43% return on investment at token launch. More than $13.9 million has been raised so far, and more than 14800 early investors have taken part in the presale. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, a 14.23% increase from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance enhances protocol security via CertiK-supported bug bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK as a security and transparency initiative. Users will be rewarded with the value of 50,000 USDT for reporting probable bugs in the project. The aim of the bounty program is to provide equal coverage for all classes of vulnerabilities. It has been divided into four classes of severity, i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announces huge token giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway in which individuals entering the contest will be rewarded in the form of MUTM tokens, each worth $10,000. The project’s newly launched leaderboard system will compensate the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders. Bonus tokens are awarded upon leveling up. Mutuum Finance: revolutionizing DeFi lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a game-changer in DeFi lending via a product that offers clients the highest possible degree of control over assets. It is an open, multi-purpose double-lending platform developed via the convergence of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Access to the P2C lending pool is through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the prevailing sentiment in the market, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic risk of lending. Middlemen are cut out in the P2P model, giving room for direct lending, appropriate for volatile assets like meme coins. Pepe Coin (PEPE) is losing steam as traders shift away from hype-driven plays. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining ground. The project is in Presale Stage 6 at $0.035. Early buyers can lock in a 71.43% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Over $13.9 million has been raised. More than 14,800 investors have already joined. With a $50,000 CertiK-backed bug bounty, a $100,000 token giveaway, and an innovative dual lending system, MUTM stands out as a real utility-driven project. Don’t wait for Stage 7’s price jump.

2025-08-02 16:55:13,49430525,1754153713,US Crypto Exchange-Traded Funds Beat Out Vanguard’s Legendary S&P 500 ETF in Record-Setting Month of Inflows: Analyst,"New data from senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas reveals that US crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds) beat out Vanguard’s renowned S&P 500 ETF (VOO) in July. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Balchunas notes that US crypto ETFs had a staggering $12.8 billion worth of inflows in July, outpacing all other ETFs, including VOO, which currently has $713.13 billion in assets under its management . “US Crypto ETFs took in $12.8 billion in July, the best month ever, [at] a $600m/day pace, about double [the] average. As a group, that’s more than any single ETF did, including the Mighty VOO. Further, every ETF in [the] category took in cash (ex the converted trusts) w/ Bitcoin and Ether making equal contributions. Most all-around dominant performance since the Eagles ended the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Will be hard to top.” Source: Eric Balchunas/X The analyst goes on to say that asset management titan BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is doing well and drawing in new customers. “Amazing stat: 75% of the investors who bought IBIT ($87 billion via one million people) were first-time customers of BlackRock. And 27% of them went on to buy another iShares ETF. Just a total coup for BLK all around.” According to Balchunas, IBIT – which launched in January 2024 – had a significant hand in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) massive price growth over the last two years. “1) ETFs hold BTC at a 1:1 ratio. There is no lending, there is no paper IOUs. ETFs are clean and above board and every dime of AUM is connected to the proportional Bitcoin. 2) Zoom out: Bitcoin is up nearly 300%(!) since the infamous BlackRock filing two years ago.

2025-08-02 06:55:11,49405435,1754117711,Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer’s Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer’s Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and few areas capture attention quite like Bitcoin mining . It’s the engine that powers the entire Bitcoin network, creating new coins and validating transactions. Recently, a significant player in this space, Bitdeer, shared some exciting news that highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset accumulation. This development offers a fascinating glimpse into the operations of large-scale miners and their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. Bitdeer, a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) cloud mining company, recently announced via X that it successfully mined a total of 63.1 BTC over the past week. This achievement not only demonstrates their operational efficiency but also provides valuable insight into their strategic asset management. The firm also sold 26.8 BTC during the same period, indicating a thoughtful approach to balancing liquidity with long-term holdings. Consequently, Bitdeer’s pure holdings have increased by 36.4 BTC, bringing their total to an impressive 1,637.8 BTC. This growth underscores the ongoing profitability and strategic importance of professional Bitcoin mining operations. What is Bitcoin Mining and How Does Bitdeer Excel? For those new to the crypto world, you might be wondering: what exactly is Bitcoin mining ? At its core, it is the process by which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation, and new transactions are added to the blockchain. This process involves powerful computers solving complex computational puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. It’s a critical function that ensures the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Bitdeer operates primarily as a cloud mining service. What does this mean? Instead of individuals buying and maintaining expensive mining hardware, they can purchase ‘hash rate’ from companies like Bitdeer. This allows them to participate in Bitcoin mining without the complexities of managing equipment, electricity costs, or cooling systems. Bitdeer leverages its vast infrastructure, advanced mining rigs, and optimized energy solutions to perform mining operations on a large scale. Their expertise in managing these complex systems allows them to achieve consistent mining outputs, as evidenced by their recent 63.1 BTC weekly haul. This model democratizes access to mining while centralizing the operational heavy lifting. Bitdeer’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: A Deep Dive into Growth Bitdeer’s recent report isn’t just about the quantity of Bitcoin mined; it also reveals a strategic approach to managing their digital assets. Mining 63.1 BTC in a week is a significant feat, but their decision to sell 26.8 BTC alongside this achievement provides a clearer picture of their operational strategy. This balancing act of accumulating new assets while liquidating a portion can be crucial for covering operational expenses, reinvesting in infrastructure, or managing market exposure. It reflects a sophisticated financial management strategy typical of large-scale crypto enterprises. The net increase of 36.4 BTC to their pure holdings, bringing the total to 1,637.8 BTC, demonstrates a clear long-term accumulation strategy. This indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and a commitment to growing their digital asset reserves. Understanding these movements is key to appreciating the financial health and strategic direction of a major Bitcoin mining entity. Let’s look at a simplified breakdown of their recent activity: Activity Amount (BTC) Impact on Holdings BTC Mined This Week 63.1 Increase BTC Sold This Week 26.8 Decrease Net Increase in Holdings 36.4 Positive Current Total Holdings 1,637.8 Accumulated This table illustrates the company’s dynamic management of its mined assets, highlighting a strategy that balances immediate needs with long-term accumulation. Such transparency from a major player like Bitdeer offers valuable data points for market analysts and investors. The Broader Impact of Robust Bitcoin Mining Operations The consistent success of large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Bitdeer has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Firstly, it contributes to the overall security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. The more miners there are, and the more robust their operations, the more secure the network becomes against potential attacks. Secondly, their operational scale influences the market dynamics. While mining introduces new supply, the strategic holding patterns of major miners can also impact market sentiment and available supply for trading. Furthermore, the growth of companies like Bitdeer drives innovation in the mining sector. This includes advancements in energy efficiency, the development of more powerful mining hardware, and the exploration of sustainable energy sources for mining. As the industry matures, the focus on environmental impact becomes more pronounced, pushing miners towards greener solutions. Bitdeer, like many other large players, is increasingly investing in renewable energy projects to power their operations, aligning with global sustainability goals. This shift is vital for the long-term viability and public perception of Bitcoin mining . The profitability of Bitcoin mining is also closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, as well as the network’s difficulty adjustment and the block reward halving events. With the recent halving, the block reward for miners was cut in half, making operational efficiency and strategic asset management even more critical for profitability. Companies like Bitdeer, with their established infrastructure and strong financial position, are better equipped to navigate these changes compared to smaller, less capitalized operations. Their ability to continue mining and accumulating BTC post-halving speaks volumes about their resilience and long-term vision. Challenges and Opportunities in the Bitcoin Mining Landscape While the recent figures from Bitdeer paint a positive picture, the Bitcoin mining industry is not without its challenges. Volatility in Bitcoin’s price directly impacts revenue. Energy costs, regulatory changes, and increasing network difficulty are constant factors that miners must navigate. The competition is fierce, and staying ahead requires continuous investment in technology and infrastructure. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities. The drive for greater energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources are pushing the industry towards a more sustainable future. Innovation in mining hardware continues to improve profitability and reduce operational footprints. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these dynamics is key. The strength of mining operations like Bitdeer can be seen as a barometer for the health and confidence within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Their continued accumulation of BTC signals a strong belief in the asset’s long-term value, providing a layer of stability and institutional backing to the market. The transparency provided by companies like Bitdeer, sharing their mining output and holdings, helps build trust and provides valuable data for market analysis. Conclusion Bitdeer’s recent announcement of mining 63.1 BTC and increasing its pure holdings to over 1,637 BTC highlights the robust and evolving nature of the Bitcoin mining industry. It showcases not only the company’s operational strength but also its strategic approach to asset management in a dynamic market. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the role of large-scale miners like Bitdeer becomes increasingly important in securing the network, driving innovation, and shaping the supply-side economics of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Their ongoing success is a testament to the enduring power and potential of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is cloud mining, and how does Bitdeer fit into it? Cloud mining allows individuals to participate in Bitcoin mining by renting computing power (hash rate) from a mining farm like Bitdeer, rather than owning and operating their own hardware. Bitdeer provides the infrastructure and expertise for large-scale mining operations. Q2: Why did Bitdeer sell some of the Bitcoin they mined? Selling a portion of mined Bitcoin is a common strategic move for mining companies. It helps cover operational costs, invest in new equipment, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market prices while still accumulating a net increase in their holdings. Q3: How does Bitcoin mining impact the Bitcoin network? Bitcoin mining is crucial for the network’s security and functionality. Miners validate transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new bitcoins. This process maintains the integrity and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Q4: What are the main challenges for Bitcoin mining companies today? Key challenges include the volatile price of Bitcoin, rising energy costs, increasing network difficulty (making mining harder), and evolving regulatory landscapes. The recent Bitcoin halving also significantly reduced block rewards, increasing pressure on profitability. Q5: How does Bitdeer’s accumulation of BTC affect the market? When large entities like Bitdeer accumulate significant amounts of BTC, it can signal long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Their strategic holding patterns can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially influencing market dynamics and sentiment. Q6: Is Bitcoin mining becoming more environmentally friendly? Yes, there is a growing trend towards more sustainable Bitcoin mining. Many large mining operations, including Bitdeer, are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources like hydro, solar, and wind power to reduce their carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency.

This has prompted project proponents and analysts to ask who is selling at such adverse times for the underlying asset’s price. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko It’s safe to say that the past few days have been quite painful for the entire cryptocurrency industry, with more than $250 billion evaporating from the total market cap. Bitcoin’s price tumbled to multi-week lows of under $113,000, while many altcoins have crashed by 5-10%. However, Pi Network’s native token has taken this correction even worse. Pi has slumped by 16% in the past day alone, and more than 30% monthly. As a result, it plunged to a new all-time low today at $0.34 (on CoinGecko), which broke the previous anti-record from yesterday. On some exchanges, the price slump was even more profound, prompting analysts like Moon Jeff to ask who is selling at such low levels. $PI broke below its previous low at 40 cents. Now at 0.32. I wonder who is still selling coins now. #Pinetwork pic.twitter.com/2nKUvv7LdL — MOON JEFF (@CRYPTOAD00) August 2, 2025 This price crash occurred after a massive token unlock period for Pi, in which the total daily number of freed coins frequently exceeded 10 million. Data from PiScan shows that there could be some relief in the near future. The token unlocks are set to be reduced in the next month, as only two days will see more than 7.5 million coins released. The average for the next month will be at 5.3 million, which is a lot fewer than the 7+ million in June and July. This could reduce the immediate selling pressure for Pi and perhaps stop the freefalls, at least for the time being. PI Token Unlock Schedule.

2025-08-02 06:32:13,49423635,1754116333,"Here is How High Shiba Inu Must Rise for SHIB to Clinch 3rd, 4th, or 5th Place in Crypto Rankings","Optimism about Shiba Inu’s potential push into the top five crypto rankings has been reignited as large investors indicate interest in SHIB. The broader Shiba Inu community eagerly anticipates SHIB’s potential ascent into the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Momentum behind this goal has surged since November 2024, when lead developer Shytoshi Kusama unveiled plans to propel SHIB into the top five rankings. Shiba Inu Lead's Ambitious Aspiration As previously reported , the Shiba Inu lead referenced an AI-generated painting depicting a man conducting research at a cluttered desk overflowing with books. Commenting, Kusama noted that it reflects how he tries to use a small budget to give SHIB utility and take the token to the top five crypto rankings in less than five years. It’s been nine months since Kusama shared this aspiration, and SHIB has dropped from the 13th position, where it sat at the time, to the 22nd place. Nonetheless, some enthusiasts have remained optimistic about SHIB’s potential to break into the crypto top five. This optimism has soared lately as large holders shift huge amounts of tokens from exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Last month, two unlabeled blockchain addresses withdrew 5 trillion SHIB and 110.34 billion tokens from Coinbase and Binance, respectively. For context, cracking the top 5 would place SHIB among the five largest cryptocurrencies in the world. This could see SHIB rank as either the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Growth Required to Position SHIB in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th Crypto Rankings Despite sitting in the 22nd position, we explored how high the token must rise to ascend to the third, fourth, or fifth place in the global crypto ranking. Notably, Shiba Inu is still trying to stage a rebound after reacting negatively to Trump’s new tariff plan, which sent it crashing below $0.000012. However, SHIB has rebounded above $0.000012 and currently trades at $0.000012, translating to a market cap of $7.2 billion. Currently, XRP, USDT, and BNB occupy the third, fourth, and fifth spots with market caps of $178.48 billion, $163.85 billion, and $106.99 billion, respectively. For Shiba Inu to claim the third place and potentially overtake XRP, its market cap would need to surge approximately 2,386% to about $179 billion. Similarly, elevating SHIB into the fourth slot and usurping USDT would require a 2,177% increase to $164 billion, and cracking the top five by surpassing BNB would demand a 1,400% climb to $108 billion. If Shiba Inu’s supply remains stable at 589 trillion tokens, achieving valuations of $108 billion, $164 billion, or $179 billion would propel SHIB’s price to $0.000183, $0.000278, or $0.000303, respectively. ChatGPT Insights on Projections According to ChatGPT, Shiba Inu’s potential surge to these targets is within the realm of possibility. The AI chatbot speculated that SHIB will attain the $0.000183 target over the next six months or by February 2026, potentially driven by a strong altcoin season. It speculated that it would take within 1 - 3 years for the asset to reach a price range of $0.000278 - $0.000303. ChatGPT believes that SHIB would require a historic bull run and breakthroughs to achieve these targets. ChatGPT forecast for SHIB rally ChatGPT forecast for SHIB rally Despite the bullish projection, caution is still required, given the volatility of the crypto market. Shiba Inu’s potential ascent to the third, fourth, or fifth place in the global crypto ranking could be hindered by the lack of institutional interest in the token. Shiba Inu has yet to get a single filing for a spot-based ETF, unlike other meme-based tokens, such as Dogecoin and Official Trump. Speculation suggests that the anonymous nature of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem team may be discouraging institutions from engaging with SHIB like other meme-based tokens.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,1,optimism shiba inu potential push top five crypto ranking reignited large investor indicate interest shib broader shiba inu community eagerly anticipates shib potential ascent top five cryptocurrencies market capitalization momentum behind goal surged since november lead developer shytoshi kusama unveiled plan propel shib top five ranking shiba inu lead ambitious aspiration previously reported shiba inu lead referenced painting depicting man conducting research cluttered desk overflowing book commenting kusama noted reflects try use small budget give shib utility take token top five crypto ranking less five year nine month since kusama shared aspiration shib dropped position sat time place nonetheless enthusiast remained optimistic shib potential break crypto top five optimism soared lately large holder shift huge amount token exchange like coinbase binance last month two unlabeled blockchain address withdrew trillion shib billion token coinbase binance respectively context cracking top would place shib among five largest cryptocurrencies world could see shib rank either first second third fourth cryptocurrency market cap growth required position shib crypto ranking despite sitting position explored high token must rise ascend third fourth fifth place global crypto ranking notably shiba inu still trying stage rebound reacting negatively trump new tariff plan sent crashing however shib rebounded currently trade translating market cap billion currently xrp usdt bnb occupy third fourth fifth spot market cap billion billion billion respectively shiba inu claim third place potentially overtake xrp market cap would need surge approximately billion similarly elevating shib fourth slot usurping usdt would require increase billion cracking top five surpassing bnb would demand climb billion shiba inu supply remains stable trillion token achieving valuation billion billion billion would propel shib price respectively chatgpt insight projection according chatgpt shiba inu potential surge target within realm possibility ai chatbot speculated shib attain target next six month february potentially driven strong altcoin season speculated would take within year asset reach price range chatgpt belief shib would require historic bull run breakthrough achieve target chatgpt forecast shib rally chatgpt forecast shib rally despite bullish projection caution still required given volatility crypto market shiba inu potential ascent third fourth fifth place global crypto ranking could hindered lack institutional interest token shiba inu yet get single filing etf unlike token dogecoin official trump speculation suggests anonymous nature shiba inu ecosystem team may discouraging institution engaging shib like token,0.023,0.796,0.181,0.9955,1

2025-08-02 06:30:30,49404489,1754116230,Crypto Insiders Say One Move Now Could Change Everything by September,"As the SEC rolls out its Project Crypto initiative – a landmark regulatory overhaul designed to support tokenized securities, DeFi integration, and streamlined issuance—many crypto insiders are pointing to September as a pivotal turning point . Analysts expect clear definitions and guidelines may unlock institutional and retail flows previously held back. In this landscape, investors are watching for projects that can merge momentum with structural credibility. One such emerging token increasingly mentioned in this circle—and appearing on trusted ledger lists – is MAGACOIN FINANCE, now riding peak visibility amid security validation and audit-backed trust. Why September may mark a structural shift in crypto trust Media reports and industry commentary suggest the SEC’s policy change is more than technical – it’s symbolic . By shifting toward supportive frameworks around token classifications, staking, and digital-ledger security, the agency may offer renewed confidence to institutions now positioning for regulatory clarity. As insiders pivot capital in anticipation, timing and trust credentials become critical entry points. High on credibility and trust metrics Unlike many early-stage altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a perfect 10/10 TrustScore from independent auditors – based on transparent tokenomics, fixed supply, verified smart contracts. Complementing this, the project has passed a full smart contract audit, with no critical vulnerabilities identified and structural integrity confirmed. Analysts consistently highlight its governance and public verification as rare strengths in the meme-token space. As regulations evolve, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a model case of early-stage altcoins built on structural transparency and audit-backed security. How these dynamics shape tactical investor decisions Historically, crypto cycles reward those who enter when both regulatory clarity and project legitimacy are aligning—before mainstream entry floods in. If September does usher in crypto-friendly policy, projects with public trust credentials and early technical validation are likely to outperform . Tokens that combine visible demand, audit transparency, and time-sensitive access often become the breakout candidates. MAGACOIN FINANCE now fits that profile—with its latest audit bolstering investor confidence in this critical phase. Conclusion: Timing, trust, and transparency converge Crypto insiders are eyeing the SEC’s reforms as a potential watershed moment – one that may change the playing field for early – stage assets . MAGACOIN FINANCE, fortified by independent audit ratings and TrustScore excellence, stands out as a token aligning momentum with legitimacy. Whether regulators deliver or not, the message is clear: when structural trust , audit credentials, and early visibility coincide, the long – term opportunity often follows. Investors positioning now may be able to capitalize before broader institutional adoption shifts the landscape.

The mission? Becoming the first token in the world that everybody holds, no matter their background, wealth, or level of crypto knowledge. What began as a bold experiment in fair tokenomics has evolved into a movement backed by data, unwavering community support, and unmatched staying power. HOLD sets out to be the Bitcoin on Ethereum, acting as a primary store of value with no one wallet owning more than 0.58% of the supply. Built Different from Day One At launch, HOLD introduced a revolutionary mechanism that took the entire market by surprise: no one could buy more than a tiny sliver of the supply. The buy limit increased slowly, eliminating early bot abuse and whale dominance. This approach inspired countless imitators, but none could match HOLD’s balance of fairness and organic growth. Then, the developer took it a step further—first buying 72.22% of the total supply with his own funds, and then burning it (see Etherscan ). The result: no central supply, no major dumps, and no future dilution. What remains is pure scarcity, controlled entirely by the retail investors. Backed by the Community, Not VC Money HOLD is a community takeover (CTO) project with no developer wallet or team wallet. The project is entirely community owned. From crypto veterans like Paddy (known for early calls on SHIB and Telcoin) and WIZZ , to community members grinding in X Spaces and IRL sticker warriors all over the world, $HOLD is powered by real people—not insiders or VCs. That means no VC wallets, no airdrops, and no token unlocks. HOLD’s grassroots movement continues to grow, with nearly 2,000 new holders in the last 90 days alone. Impeccable strength and tenure Having survived 660 days in the crypto trenches proves the strength of HOLD and its community. In this time, HOLD has survived three 80%+ pullbacks. This is significant and stands as a milestone in the crypto community, and the holder base has changed from early adopters to diehard believers. HOLD has achieved what many projects only dream of, and is primed for its next stage as we head into the strongest crypto bull market the world has ever seen, with a chart that calls to mind similar projects like SPX, SHIB, and DOGE, only with much greater upside potential. Soon Everybody Will Hold The mission of HOLD is simple but powerful: Everybody Will Hold. Everybody in crypto, then eventually everybody on Earth. Already, the community is spreading the word in over 40 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. With its unrivaled distribution and supply dynamics, HOLD has become a universal symbol of fairness, community, and shared opportunity in crypto. Now Live on Base With a new deployment on the Base chain, HOLD begins its next chapter. Faster and less expensive transactions bring accessibility to a new wave of holders, without compromising the original mission. Both smart contracts are now live: ETH Contract: 0x68b36248477277865c64dfc78884ef80577078f3 BASE Contract: 0x9493c825f691f272ce12b0d001b746130629bf71 HOLD Stats (July 2025) Price: $0.0093 Market Cap: $25.7M Holders: 4490 Circ.

2025-08-02 06:25:10,49404180,1754115910,BTC Long-Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Insights for Smarter Futures Trading,"BitcoinWorld BTC Long-Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Insights for Smarter Futures Trading In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, understanding market sentiment is paramount. For Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures, one of the most revealing indicators is the BTC long-short ratio . This metric offers a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate a price increase (long) or a decrease (short). It is not just a number; it is a pulse check of the market’s collective conviction, a tool that can empower traders to make more informed decisions. By analyzing these ratios, we can gain valuable insights into potential market movements and identify shifts in investor psychology. What Exactly Is the BTC Long-Short Ratio? The BTC long-short ratio is a simple yet powerful indicator that reflects the proportion of long positions versus short positions on a given cryptocurrency exchange for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative product that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. Long Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will increase. They profit if the price goes up. Short Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will decrease. They profit if the price goes down. The Ratio Calculation: The ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of long positions by the total number or volume of short positions. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 indicates more short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment. Our data presents it as percentages for easier understanding. This ratio provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among leveraged traders. When a significant majority of traders are leaning one way, it can sometimes signal an impending reversal, as extreme positioning often precedes a shift in market direction. Decoding the Daily BTC Long-Short Ratio Landscape Let us examine the recent 24-hour BTC long-short ratio data for Bitcoin perpetual futures across several prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. This data offers immediate insight into current market positioning: Metric Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Across Exchanges 48.22% 51.78% Binance 48.05% 51.95% Bybit 47.12% 52.88% Gate.io 49.96% 50.04% As observed from the table, the aggregated data indicates a slight dominance of short positions, with 51.78% of traders leaning bearish compared to 48.22% leaning bullish. This suggests a cautious or slightly negative sentiment among futures traders over the past 24 hours. Individual exchange data largely mirrors this trend, with Bybit showing the strongest bearish bias and Gate.io exhibiting a near-even split, indicating diverse sentiment across platforms. This collective positioning is a key aspect of understanding the current market mood regarding the BTC long-short ratio . Why Do These BTC Long-Short Ratios Matter for Your Trading Strategy? Understanding the BTC long-short ratio is not just an academic exercise; it provides practical utility for your trading strategy. This metric offers several benefits for traders looking to gain an edge in the volatile crypto market: Sentiment Gauge: The most direct application is as a sentiment indicator. A high percentage of long positions suggests optimism, while a high percentage of short positions indicates pessimism. This can help confirm or contradict your own market bias. Contrarian Signals: Extreme imbalances in the ratio can sometimes act as contrarian signals. For instance, if the ratio shows an overwhelming number of long positions, it might suggest that the market is overextended, and a correction or reversal could be imminent. Similarly, an excessive number of short positions might indicate a potential short squeeze or bounce. Liquidation Risk Assessment: When one side of the market is heavily leveraged, it creates a pool of potential liquidations. If the price moves against the majority, these liquidations can trigger cascading effects, leading to rapid price swings. Monitoring the BTC long-short ratio can help anticipate such volatility. Confirmation Tool: The ratio can be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and on-chain data to confirm trading signals. For example, if a chart pattern suggests a bullish breakout, and the long-short ratio is also increasing, it could provide stronger conviction for a long trade. Challenges and Nuances in Interpreting BTC Long-Short Ratios While the BTC long-short ratio is a valuable tool, it is not without its complexities and limitations. A nuanced understanding is crucial to avoid misinterpretations: Data Aggregation Issues: The data often comes from various exchanges, and not all platforms provide transparent or real-time ratio information. Aggregated data, while useful, might not capture the full picture of the entire market. Context is Paramount: The ratio should never be used in isolation. It must be analyzed alongside other key metrics such as funding rates, open interest, price action, and broader macroeconomic factors. A high long ratio during a strong uptrend might be healthy, whereas the same ratio during a consolidation phase could signal a top. Whale Influence: Large institutional traders or ‘whales’ can significantly skew the ratio with their substantial positions. Their motives might differ from retail traders, and their positioning could be part of a larger strategy not immediately apparent from the ratio alone. Short-Term Focus: The 24-hour BTC long-short ratio primarily reflects short-term sentiment. While useful for day traders, it might not provide significant insights for long-term investors. Longer timeframes or aggregated historical data might be needed for broader trend analysis. Lagging vs. Leading Indicator: In some scenarios, the ratio can be a lagging indicator, reflecting what has already happened. In others, particularly at extremes, it can be a leading indicator of potential reversals. Discerning this requires experience and careful observation. Actionable Insights: Leveraging BTC Long-Short Ratios in Your Trading Now that we have explored what the BTC long-short ratio is and its nuances, let us discuss how to practically apply this knowledge to enhance your trading decisions: Identify Extreme Ratios: Pay close attention when the ratio deviates significantly from its historical average or approaches extreme levels (e.g., 70%+ long or 70%+ short). These extremes often precede significant price movements or reversals. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, consider if the market is due for a pullback as ‘fuel’ for short liquidations builds. Combine with Funding Rates: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts are fees paid between long and short positions to keep the contract price close to the spot price. A high positive funding rate combined with a high long-short ratio can indicate an overheated market, making long positions riskier. Conversely, negative funding rates with a high short ratio might suggest a potential short squeeze. Observe Divergences: Look for divergences between the ratio and price action. If Bitcoin’s price is making higher highs, but the BTC long-short ratio is showing a decreasing number of long positions, it could signal weakening bullish momentum or a lack of conviction from new buyers. Risk Management: Use the ratio to inform your risk management. If the market is heavily skewed in one direction, consider reducing your leverage or taking partial profits if you are on the side of the majority. If you are taking a contrarian position, ensure you have tight stop-losses. Track Across Exchanges: While the aggregate ratio is helpful, observe individual exchange ratios as well. Significant differences might indicate localized liquidity or specific trading dynamics on certain platforms. By integrating these actionable insights, traders can move beyond simply observing the BTC long-short ratio to actively using it as a component of a robust trading strategy. The Future of Market Sentiment: What’s Next for BTC Long-Short Ratios? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and so too are the tools and metrics traders use to navigate it. The BTC long-short ratio will continue to be a vital indicator for gauging short-term sentiment and potential market turning points. As the market matures and more sophisticated trading strategies emerge, the interpretation of these ratios may also evolve. The rise of institutional participation, advancements in algorithmic trading, and increasing regulatory clarity could all influence how these ratios behave and what signals they convey. Therefore, continuous learning and adaptation are essential for any trader relying on this metric. Staying informed about broader market trends and technological developments will enhance your ability to effectively utilize the BTC long-short ratio for future trading success. Conclusion The BTC long-short ratio provides a powerful lens through which to view the immediate sentiment of Bitcoin perpetual futures traders. While the recent 24-hour data suggests a slight bearish bias across major exchanges, it is crucial to remember that this metric is most effective when interpreted within a broader context. By understanding its calculation, recognizing its benefits as a sentiment and contrarian indicator, and acknowledging its limitations, traders can integrate this valuable tool into their analytical framework. Employing actionable insights such as identifying extremes, combining with funding rates, and practicing diligent risk management will enable you to leverage the BTC long-short ratio to navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater confidence and precision. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin perpetual future? A Bitcoin perpetual future is a derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. It is designed to track the underlying Bitcoin price closely through a funding rate mechanism. How does the BTC long-short ratio reflect market sentiment? The BTC long-short ratio reflects market sentiment by showing the proportion of traders betting on a price increase (long) versus those betting on a price decrease (short). A higher percentage of long positions indicates bullish sentiment, while a higher percentage of short positions indicates bearish sentiment. Can the BTC long-short ratio predict price movements? While the BTC long-short ratio is a strong indicator of sentiment and can sometimes precede price movements, especially at extreme levels, it is not a standalone predictor. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for more accurate predictions. Why do different exchanges show slightly different BTC long-short ratios? Differences in ratios across exchanges can be due to varying user bases, trading strategies prevalent on each platform, and the specific algorithms or methodologies they use to calculate and present the ratio data. Each exchange has its own unique liquidity and trader demographics. Is a high short ratio always a bad sign for Bitcoin’s price? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates prevailing bearish sentiment, extreme short positioning can sometimes lead to a ‘short squeeze.’ This occurs when the price unexpectedly rises, forcing short sellers to buy back their positions to cover losses, which further fuels the price increase. How often should I check the BTC long-short ratio? The frequency depends on your trading style. For day traders, checking the ratio hourly or every few hours might be beneficial. For swing traders, daily or even weekly checks might suffice to understand broader sentiment shifts.

2025-08-02 06:15:11,49403726,1754115311,ARK Invest Crypto: Cathie Wood’s Astounding Bet on Digital Asset Growth,"BitcoinWorld ARK Invest Crypto: Cathie Wood’s Astounding Bet on Digital Asset Growth The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and leading the charge are firms like ARK Invest, renowned for their visionary approach to disruptive innovation. When we talk about significant moves in this space, especially concerning institutional adoption, the spotlight often turns to ARK Invest crypto strategies. The firm, under the leadership of Cathie Wood, has consistently demonstrated a willingness to invest in areas they believe will shape the future, and cryptocurrency is undoubtedly one such frontier. Recently, ARK Invest made headlines again with another substantial acquisition in the digital asset sector. On August 1st, the firm purchased an additional $29.79 million in Coinbase shares and $17.129 million in Bitmain shares. This latest move, reported by Ark Invest Daily on X, underscores ARK’s unwavering confidence in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It’s a powerful signal that despite market fluctuations, ARK Invest sees fundamental value and growth opportunities within this nascent industry. What’s Behind ARK Invest Crypto’s Latest Strategic Moves? ARK Invest’s investment philosophy centers on identifying and capitalizing on disruptive innovation. Their latest acquisitions in Coinbase (COIN) and Bitmain, though a private entity and accessed likely through specific funds or derivatives given its private status, align perfectly with this core belief. These aren’t just speculative bets; they represent a strategic positioning within key pillars of the crypto economy. Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform in the United States, providing a gateway for millions of users to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Investing in Coinbase offers exposure to the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies, transaction volumes, and the overall growth of the crypto user base. It’s a direct play on the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. Bitmain, on the other hand, is a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining industry, particularly known for its ASIC miners. An investment in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, provides a stake in the foundational infrastructure of various proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. It’s about investing in the hardware that secures and enables these decentralized networks. This dual approach provides diversified exposure to the ARK Invest crypto thesis. To better visualize the scale of these recent acquisitions, consider the breakdown: Company Investment Amount (USD) Role in Crypto Ecosystem Coinbase (COIN) $29.79 Million Leading Crypto Exchange, Custody Services Bitmain $17.129 Million Dominant Crypto Mining Hardware Manufacturer Why is Coinbase a Core Component of ARK Invest Crypto Holdings? Coinbase represents a significant piece of the puzzle for ARK Invest crypto strategy due to several compelling factors. Firstly, as one of the most recognized and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, Coinbase offers a crucial on-ramp for both retail and institutional investors. Its compliance efforts and public listing provide a level of transparency and legitimacy that many other crypto ventures lack, aligning with ARK’s focus on investable innovation. Secondly, Coinbase benefits directly from the network effect of increasing crypto adoption. As more individuals and institutions enter the crypto space, Coinbase’s trading volumes, custody services, and subscription revenues are likely to grow. This positions it as a beneficiary of the overall expansion of the digital asset economy, regardless of which specific cryptocurrencies gain prominence. Furthermore, Coinbase is actively expanding its offerings beyond simple trading, venturing into areas like staking services, institutional custody, and a burgeoning developer ecosystem. This diversification provides multiple avenues for revenue growth and strengthens its position as a foundational player. For ARK Invest, owning Coinbase shares is a strategic bet on the infrastructure of the future digital financial system. How Does Bitmain Complement the ARK Invest Crypto Vision? While Coinbase focuses on the user-facing side of crypto, Bitmain delves into the very foundation of certain digital assets. Bitmain is a powerhouse in the design and manufacturing of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes it a critical player in the security and operation of these decentralized networks. Investing in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, allows ARK Invest to gain exposure to the underlying hardware layer of the crypto industry. This provides a different, yet equally vital, exposure compared to an exchange. It’s a play on the ongoing need for computational power to validate transactions and secure blockchain networks. As Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies continue to operate, the demand for efficient mining hardware persists. This strategic move highlights ARK’s comprehensive view of the crypto market, acknowledging that both the front-end user experience (Coinbase) and the back-end infrastructure (Bitmain) are essential for the long-term viability and growth of the digital asset ecosystem. It demonstrates a holistic understanding of how the ARK Invest crypto portfolio can gain exposure to various critical aspects of the industry. What Are the Broader Implications of ARK Invest Crypto Investments? These consistent investments by ARK Invest, particularly in high-profile companies like Coinbase and key infrastructure providers like Bitmain, send a powerful message to the broader financial market. They signify increasing institutional confidence in the legitimacy and staying power of digital assets. When a firm with the reputation and research capabilities of ARK Invest makes such moves, it often encourages other institutional players to take a closer look. Validation of the Asset Class: ARK’s continued buying reinforces the idea that cryptocurrencies are not just a fleeting trend but a legitimate and evolving asset class with long-term potential. Diversification Strategy: For ARK’s various ETFs, these investments provide diversified exposure to the crypto market beyond simply holding Bitcoin or Ethereum directly. They offer a way to participate in the growth of the infrastructure and service providers. Market Sentiment Influence: Cathie Wood’s pronouncements and ARK’s investment decisions often move markets. Their acquisitions can generate positive sentiment and draw attention to the underlying companies and the crypto sector as a whole. Focus on Innovation: The acquisitions underscore ARK’s commitment to investing in disruptive technologies. They view blockchain and digital assets as fundamental innovations that will reshape various industries. The consistent pattern of these acquisitions by ARK Invest crypto funds suggests a deeply held conviction in the transformative power of decentralized technologies and digital currencies. It’s a long-term vision that looks beyond daily price fluctuations to the fundamental shifts occurring in finance and technology. What Challenges Might ARK Invest Crypto Holdings Face? While ARK Invest’s bullish stance on crypto is clear, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with investing in this volatile sector. No investment is without its hurdles, and digital assets present a unique set: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and by extension, companies whose revenues are tied to them, can experience significant and rapid fluctuations. This volatility can impact the short-to-medium term performance of ARK’s holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains largely undefined in many jurisdictions, including the United States. Changes in regulations could significantly impact companies like Coinbase, affecting their operations, compliance costs, and business models. Competition: The crypto space is highly competitive, with new exchanges, mining operations, and blockchain technologies emerging constantly. This competition could erode market share or profitability for existing players. Technological Risks: While blockchain technology is robust, it’s still evolving. Risks such as security breaches, protocol vulnerabilities, or unexpected technological shifts could impact the entire ecosystem. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate changes, and global liquidity can also influence investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially affecting the performance of ARK Invest crypto assets. ARK Invest is known for its long-term investment horizon, often looking beyond short-term market noise. However, these challenges remain important considerations for any investor evaluating the digital asset space. Conclusion: ARK Invest’s Enduring Vision for Digital Assets ARK Invest’s continued accumulation of shares in companies like Coinbase and Bitmain is more than just a series of transactions; it’s a reaffirmation of their profound conviction in the future of digital assets. Cathie Wood and her team are not simply reacting to market trends; they are actively positioning their portfolios to benefit from what they believe will be one of the most significant technological and financial transformations of our era. Their strategic focus on both the user-facing platforms and the underlying infrastructure demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the crypto ecosystem’s growth drivers. These moves underscore a belief that despite the inherent volatility and regulatory headwinds, the long-term trajectory for digital assets is upward. For investors watching the space, ARK Invest’s consistent commitment to ARK Invest crypto investments serves as a powerful indicator of institutional confidence and a potential roadmap for how established finance views the evolving digital frontier. It’s a compelling narrative of innovation meeting investment, shaping the financial landscape for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ARK Invest?

2025-08-02 06:13:09,49403696,1754115189,"An Unusual Proposal Has Been Put Forward for a Surprise Altcoin: If It Happens, It Will Be a First","Phil_00Llama, an active member of CurveDAO (CRV), has presented a compelling proposal to halt the future expansion of decentralized exchange Curve Finance onto Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks. The proposal follows a similar call last month by Aave co-founder Marc Zeller to halt the deployment of the Aave protocol on the Bitcoin Layer 2 network BOB. “L2s consume the time of talented developers. Each of these chains requires as much care as Ethereum, but the returns are minimal. By cutting development in this area, Curve can focus on more productive aspects,” phil_00Llama said in a post on the CurveDAO forum yesterday. For years, Ethereum has adopted a “rollup-centric roadmap” strategy, aiming to increase scalability through Layer 2 solutions. However, this approach is now being questioned by some. Some advocate for a renewed focus on Ethereum's core layer (Layer 1). Related News: Nasdaq-listed Company Announces Major Bitcoin and Solana Purchase Curve Finance is active on approximately 25 chains, including Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and many more. However, according to DeFiLlama data, the platform's total locked value (TVL) is almost entirely on the Ethereum mainnet: approximately $2.3 billion. Layer 2 platforms Arbitrum and Base only hold around $50 million in TVL. phil_00Llama justifies this by saying, “Curve’s pools on the Ethereum mainnet generate 450 times more revenue than all L2s combined, even on the slowest day.” He also argues that the focus should be on expanding Curve’s stablecoin solution, scrvUSD, on Ethereum. A CurveDAO member noted that L2 deployments only generate around $1,500 per day in revenue, making it an inefficient strategy given the high maintenance costs and short-lived network structures. He argued that developers should focus on “more meaningful work” instead. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-02 06:10:10,49403539,1754115010,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation, and at the heart of the latest discussion is a bold Bitcoin price prediction from a familiar name: Arthur Hayes. As co-founder of the prominent BitMEX crypto exchange, Hayes’s insights carry significant weight within the digital asset community. His recent pronouncements via X suggest that Bitcoin could be on a trajectory to test the monumental $100,000 mark, with Ethereum potentially reaching $3,000. But what exactly underpins this audacious forecast, and what does it mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into the macroeconomic forces and strategic thinking that could propel these digital giants to new heights. What’s Driving Arthur Hayes’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Arthur Hayes’s outlook isn’t merely a speculative guess; it’s rooted in a nuanced analysis of global macroeconomic conditions, particularly focusing on the United States. His recent observations highlight that the full impact of U.S. tariff policies is expected to become significantly more apparent in the third quarter of the year. This assessment comes in the wake of critical U.S. nonfarm payroll data, which provides a snapshot of the nation’s economic health and labor market dynamics. Hayes underscores a critical point: “No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” This statement is central to his Bitcoin price prediction . In essence, he argues that the traditional economic engines of major economies are struggling to generate sufficient credit growth to stimulate nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). When traditional financial systems face such constraints, investors often seek alternative assets that are less correlated with conventional markets or that offer a hedge against potential inflation or economic stagnation. Key factors contributing to Hayes’s perspective include: U.S. Tariff Policies: These policies can disrupt global supply chains, influence trade balances, and impact inflation, potentially leading to a flight of capital into non-traditional assets. Nonfarm Payroll Data: While seemingly a labor market indicator, its implications extend to consumer spending, economic growth, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Weak or stagnant growth signals can prompt investors to look for store-of-value assets. Credit Creation Deficit: A lack of sufficient credit growth means less money flowing into productive economic activities, which can depress nominal GDP. This scenario often pushes capital into assets perceived as scarce or independent of traditional financial system vulnerabilities, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding the Macroeconomic Undercurrents Influencing Bitcoin Hayes’s analysis suggests a deeper interplay between global finance and the crypto market. The concept of “credit creation” is fundamental to how economies grow. When banks lend money, they create new credit, which fuels investment, consumption, and ultimately, nominal GDP. If this process slows down significantly across major economies, it implies a tightening of financial conditions or a lack of robust economic activity. In such an environment, assets that exist outside the traditional banking system, like cryptocurrencies, can become attractive. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is particularly appealing due to its decentralized nature, finite supply, and perceived resistance to inflationary pressures. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and burgeoning role in the Web3 space, also stands to benefit as capital seeks innovative and independent avenues. Consider the potential ripple effects: Economic Factor Impact on Traditional Markets Potential Effect on Crypto (BTC/ETH) Slow Credit Growth Reduced nominal GDP, potential stagnation Increased demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin Tariff Policy Impacts Supply chain disruption, inflation concerns Hedge against inflation, flight to digital gold Weak Nonfarm Payrolls Signals economic slowdown, lower consumer confidence Investors seek uncorrelated assets, pushing the Bitcoin price prediction higher Arthur Hayes’s Personal Market Moves: A Strategic Insight into Bitcoin’s Future? Interestingly, Hayes’s optimistic Bitcoin price prediction comes alongside some notable personal trading activity. Earlier, he offloaded significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethena (ENA). While this might seem counterintuitive to a bullish stance, it often reflects sophisticated portfolio management or tactical positioning rather than a loss of faith in the long-term potential of these assets. Details of his recent offloads: Asset Amount Offloaded Approximate USD Value Ethereum (ETH) 2,373 ETH $8.32 million Ethena (ENA) 7.76 million ENA $4.62 million Arthur Hayes’s strategic moves are often closely watched by the crypto community for insights into market trends and potential shifts in the Bitcoin price prediction. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future Such moves could indicate several strategies: Profit Taking: Cashing out gains from recent rallies to secure profits. Rebalancing: Adjusting portfolio allocation to increase exposure to other assets, or to raise cash for future opportunities. Tax Planning: Strategic sales can sometimes be related to managing tax liabilities. Funding Other Ventures: Capital might be needed for investments in new projects or personal endeavors. It is important to differentiate between a short-term tactical trade and a long-term fundamental belief. Hayes’s continued public optimism regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum’s future suggests his recent sales are likely part of a broader, more sophisticated financial strategy, rather than a sign of diminishing conviction in his long-term Bitcoin price prediction . Is a $100K Bitcoin Target a Realistic Outlook? The idea of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is not new, but it consistently garners attention. Arthur Hayes’s specific macroeconomic rationale adds another layer of credibility to this often-discussed target. While such a surge would represent significant gains for investors, it’s crucial to consider the various factors that could influence this trajectory. Potential Benefits of a $100K Bitcoin: Increased Mainstream Adoption: Higher prices often bring more institutional and retail interest, further legitimizing crypto. Network Effect: A rising price can attract more developers, users, and capital into the ecosystem, strengthening its foundation. Wealth Creation: Significant returns for early investors and those who have held through market cycles. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: The path to $100K is unlikely to be smooth, with potential for sharp corrections. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto gains prominence, so does the attention from regulators, which can introduce new challenges. Global Economic Shocks: Unforeseen global events could alter the macroeconomic landscape Hayes describes. Competition: While Bitcoin is dominant, the broader crypto market is dynamic, with new innovations emerging. Many analysts and models, including stock-to-flow models and various quantitative analyses, have projected Bitcoin reaching or exceeding $100,000 in cycles past or in the near future. Hayes’s unique perspective, tying it to specific macroeconomic indicators like credit creation and tariff impacts, offers a fresh lens through which to view this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction . It emphasizes that traditional financial pressures can paradoxically fuel growth in decentralized assets. Arthur Hayes’s compelling Bitcoin price prediction for $100,000, and Ethereum for $3,000, provides a fascinating look into how macroeconomic shifts could drive the next major crypto bull run. His insights into U.S. tariff policies and the global credit crunch offer a robust framework for understanding why he believes digital assets are poised for significant appreciation. While his personal trading activities might appear contradictory at first glance, they likely represent strategic maneuvers within a larger, bullish long-term vision. As the third quarter unfolds and economic data continues to emerge, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if Hayes’s bold forecast becomes a reality, cementing Bitcoin’s role as a formidable asset in an evolving global economy. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Prediction Q1: Who is Arthur Hayes? A1: Arthur Hayes is the co-founder of BitMEX, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. He is well-known for his insightful macroeconomic analyses and bold predictions within the crypto space. Q2: What is Arthur Hayes’s latest Bitcoin price prediction? A2: Arthur Hayes expects Bitcoin (BTC) to test the $100,000 level and Ethereum (ETH) to test the $3,000 level. This is his latest Bitcoin price prediction . Q3: What factors influence Arthur Hayes’s Bitcoin price prediction? A3: Hayes’s prediction is primarily influenced by the anticipated impact of U.S. tariff policies becoming more apparent in Q3, and his observation that “no major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” These macroeconomic conditions suggest a shift of capital towards decentralized assets. Q4: Why did Arthur Hayes offload ETH and ENA if he’s bullish on crypto? A4: Personal trading activities like offloading assets often reflect sophisticated portfolio management strategies, such as profit-taking, rebalancing, or funding other ventures, rather than a change in long-term conviction. It is common for traders to take profits even if they remain bullish on the overall market direction and their Bitcoin price prediction . Q5: How do U.S. tariff policies affect Bitcoin’s price? A5: U.S. tariff policies can disrupt global trade, potentially leading to inflation or economic uncertainty. In such scenarios, investors may seek safe-haven assets or inflation hedges, and Bitcoin is often seen as a digital alternative to traditional stores of value, which can drive its price up. Q6: What is “credit creation” and why is it important for the economy? A6: Credit creation refers to the process by which banks lend money, effectively creating new money in the economy. This credit fuels investment, consumption, and economic growth (nominal GDP). A slowdown in credit creation can indicate economic stagnation, making alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing.

2025-08-02 06:00:39,49403566,1754114439,"Top Crypto Gems to Buy Under $1: Why BDAG, ADA, TRX & XLM Are Breaking Out","Low prices in crypto often fool new users into thinking the project lacks potential. A coin sitting below the $1 mark might seem like small stakes, but in reality, it could hold much more promise than others trading at higher prices. The shift in the community’s mindset is clear now; today’s participants look beyond prices and focus more on practical developments and strong foundations. Names like BlockDAG, Cardano, TRON, and Stellar are proving that affordability doesn’t mean a lack of progress. These top crypto gems to buy under $1 are making real progress across different use cases. They’re not gaining attention just for their low prices but for the solid moves happening in the background. Let’s dive into why each one is gaining traction. 1. BlockDAG: Rising Presale Giant Already Raised $358M Excitement around BlockDAG (BDAG) is no longer based on speculation. The project is showing real action, backed by working apps, user engagement, and strong funding. At $0.0016 per coin, BlockDAG remains accessible but has shown momentum that can’t be ignored. The presale remains open until August 11th at this price. So far, BlockDAG has sold 24.6 billion coins and raised $358 million in total presale funding, reflecting strong user confidence. With a launch price of $0.05, early supporters have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660% since batch 1. That return is rare in today’s market and continues to attract attention. What’s more, BlockDAG has successfully hosted miner demo events globally, showing its X1 and X10 products in real use. It now boasts over 4,500 builders, daily competitions like Buyer Battles, and a 15% referral reward, all of which are helping increase participation. The growing activity suggests BlockDAG could climb toward $1, and with many speculating long-term targets between $5 and $10, the upside remains large. At its current price point, BDAG stands out as one of the top crypto gems to buy under $1. With limited time left in the presale and increasing demand, it’s attracting growing attention across the crypto space. 2. Cardano: Resilient Structure and Smart Contract Strength Cardano’s development strategy, built on academic research and proof-of-stake mechanisms, gives it a unique position. It’s energy-efficient and ideal for scaling decentralized applications. The focus has always been on sustainability, long-term development, and reliable upgrades. Since early July, Cardano’s price has surged over 50%, breaking through a 230-day resistance level. Analysts see an ascending triangle forming on its chart, often a bullish sign for future growth. With a previous all-time high of $3.10, even a partial return to that range could deliver 3x–4x growth. Among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, Cardano’s ongoing research-backed development and its use in real-world applications make it a solid long-term option for those watching fundamentals closely. 3. TRON: High Volume and Fast Payments Set It Apart Hovering around $0.33, TRON focuses on powering content platforms, games, and apps that need fast transactions. The platform processes over $2 trillion in stablecoin transactions each quarter, one of the highest volumes across any blockchain. It also handles more than 2,000 transactions every second, making it extremely efficient. TRON has just passed the $0.30 threshold, showing signs of bullish movement. Its solid activity levels, rising developer community, and wide adoption continue to support strong long-term possibilities. Market analysts suggest a jump toward $5–$7 could be realistic, with a full breakout to $15–$20 possible if global use spikes. Thanks to these strengths, TRON deserves its place among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, especially for those tracking usage metrics and developer traction. 4. Stellar: Evolving With Major Partnerships and Payment Tools Stellar sits close to $0.42 and focuses on simplifying payments across borders. By linking banks, businesses, and those without access to banking, Stellar builds payment solutions for developing economies. It has kept fees low and speeds fast, thanks to upgrades like Protocol 23. The project has partnered with top firms like IBM, PayPal, and MoneyGram, which increases its utility in financial services. These collaborations helped boost Stellar’s price by 30% in recent weeks, and there’s speculation of further gains ahead. With a push into the global payment space and improving features, Stellar holds strong potential to reach $5 to $10 over time, or even $20 with broader expansion. That momentum secures Stellar’s name among the top crypto gems to buy under $1. To Sum Up! Some of the most successful digital currencies began their journeys trading for pennies. BlockDAG has already seen 2,660% growth since its first presale batch and recently hosted successful miner product demos. With over 4,500 active builders, the excitement around BDAG is real and growing as it nears the final phase of its presale. Meanwhile, Cardano’s chart strength, TRON’s massive stablecoin transaction volumes, and Stellar’s partnerships with global firms all showcase why these coins are more than just low-cost plays. These four names, BlockDAG, Cardano, TRON, and Stellar, are the top crypto gems to buy under $1 for those focused on long-term tech growth and adoption.

With a deflationary token model and viral appeal, it is positioned as one of the most compelling entries of Q3. Four other tokens—Wall Street Pepe, Haedal, Bitget Token, and SkyArk Chronicles – are drawing increased interest across social platforms and analyst circles. Each brings something unique to the table, whether it’s cultural relevance, staking utility, CEX backing, or gaming utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Predict a 10x Upside Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE blends meme culture with a pro-freedom message that has gone viral across X and Telegram. Its presale has already passed multiple milestones, signaling strong early-stage demand. Analysts believe that the token’s appeal lies not only in its branding but also in its aggressive deflationary structure and reward – driven referral model. With market sentiment improving, MAGACOIN is viewed as one of the few meme coins with both high upside and lasting momentum. The forecast? A $4,500 allocation potentially reaching $52,500 if current buyer enthusiasm holds. Wall Street Pepe (WSPE): Meme Culture Meets Market Power Wall Street Pepe is culturally resonant meme tokens of the year. Mixing themes of financial rebellion, meme warfare, and old-school trading aesthetics, WSPE has drawn in thousands of holders and continues to trend on DEXTools. With ongoing community campaigns and token burns, it’s maintaining high engagement while preparing for potential Tier 1 exchange listings. For traders looking for a narrative-rich meme coin with staying power, WSPE is becoming possible option Haedal: Cross-Chain Staking With Real Yield Utility Haedal is a new staking-focused project that’s generating buzz for its ability to provide real yield across multiple blockchains. It offers a user-friendly dashboard for managing staking portfolios and earns rewards by integrating both on-chain validator infrastructure and off-chain partnerships. Analysts are watching Haedal closely as capital continues flowing into DeFi platforms with reliable APY potential and cross-chain accessibility. Its combination of usability and functionality makes it one of August’s most practical candidates. Bitget Token (BGB): CEX-Backed Momentum Builder Bitget Token, the native coin of the Bitget exchange, is experiencing renewed momentum as exchange volumes pick up. With Bitget expanding its ecosystem, launching new staking products, and incentivizing BGB holders, demand is surging both from traders and long-term holders. BGB has also held strong through recent volatility, making it a popular pick for those seeking a mid-cap token with real-world CEX utility and steady exchange support. SkyArk Chronicles (SAC): Gaming Meets NFT Economy SkyArk Chronicles is an emerging blockchain game that merges role-playing mechanics with NFT integration. Built by a team of Web2 and Web3 veterans, SAC offers immersive gameplay while enabling item ownership through its native token. As GameFi narratives begin to rebound, SkyArk’s ecosystem approach and active development pipeline give it an edge. With community quests and NFT drops scheduled for August, momentum is quickly building . Conclusion : August is shaping up as a crucial month for identifying breakout altcoins before the next market-wide move. From the meme-powered rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Wall Street Pepe to the staking innovation of Haedal, the exchange utility of Bitget Token, and the GameFi vision of SkyArk Chronicles, each token offers a distinct value proposition. MAGACOIN’s $4,500-to-$52,500 potential stands out, but all five are gaining analyst traction as capital shifts into higher-risk, higher-reward positions. With altcoin season heating up, early entry may prove decisive.

2025-08-02 06:00:25,49403071,1754114425,"Bitcoin Drops Below $115K as Traders Rush to Exit, But a Rebound Could Be Next","Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating a period of heightened uncertainty as its price struggles to regain upward momentum following recent declines. Over the past 24 hours, the world’s largest cryptocurrency recorded a dip to $114,326 before slightly recovering above the $115,000 mark. Despite this rebound, the asset remains under pressure, with recent market movements highlighting potential shifts in trader sentiment and long-term holder behavior. Data shared by market analysts indicates that derivatives activity is playing a significant role in current price fluctuations. Insights from the analytics platform CryptoQuant suggest that sudden changes in leveraged positions and aggressive selling pressure on major exchanges are contributing to the ongoing volatility. At the same time, on-chain data shows an increase in activity from long-term Bitcoin holders, suggesting a structural change in the market that may influence future price dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet Leveraged Positions Under Pressure on Major Exchanges According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin’s decline below $115,000 coincided with a notable reduction in open interest on Binance, dropping from $14 billion to under $13.5 billion in a short span. This 4% decline in open interest within a single day is often linked to liquidation events, where leveraged positions are closed automatically due to margin calls. Taha explained that many traders appear to have exited long positions as the price fell, potentially triggering a cascade of sell orders and amplifying market pressure. Net Taker Volume on Binance also turned sharply negative, nearing -$160 million, suggesting an increase in aggressive selling activity. This trend reflects fear-driven reactions among market participants, particularly retail traders, who may have chosen to close or reverse positions amid expectations of further price declines. Despite this wave of selling, Taha noted the possibility of a short-term rebound. A reduction in leveraged long positions combined with an increase in short exposure could create conditions for a market rebalancing or a short squeeze if selling pressure eases in the coming days. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Show Signs of Major Reallocation In addition to short-term derivatives market dynamics, other analysts are pointing to broader structural changes in Bitcoin’s investor base. CryptoQuant analyst OnChainSchool highlighted that in 2024, more than 255,000 BTC previously inactive for over seven years were reactivated. In 2025, this trend has continued, with over 215,000 BTC already moving within the first several months of the year. The average monthly movement of long-dormant coins has risen from 4,900 BTC in 2023 to over 30,000 BTC in 2025. Transaction sizes have also grown significantly, from around 162 BTC to over 1,000 BTC per transfer. According to OnChainSchool, these patterns indicate that large-scale holders, rather than retail investors, are reallocating capital on a scale not seen in previous cycles. The analyst suggested that beyond price fluctuations, these shifts may have long-term implications for market liquidity and Bitcoin’s future ownership distribution.

2025-08-02 05:55:10,49402910,1754114110,Ethereum ETF Outflows: Unpacking the Massive $152 Million Shift,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Outflows: Unpacking the Massive $152 Million Shift The world of cryptocurrency investments is always dynamic, and recent events have once again underscored this volatility. On August 1, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a substantial combined net outflow of $152.26 million. This figure, as highlighted by data shared by Trader T on X, marks the third-highest single-day net outflow since these groundbreaking products were introduced to the market. Such a significant movement naturally captures the attention of investors and market analysts, prompting a closer examination of what exactly transpired and what these Ethereum ETF outflows could signify for the broader digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Specifics: Which Ethereum ETFs Saw Outflows? To fully grasp the scale of these Ethereum ETF outflows , it is essential to look at the individual products that contributed to this considerable sum. While the overall figure is impactful, understanding the distribution across various funds provides a clearer picture of investor behavior and market preferences. The data reveals that several prominent Ethereum ETFs faced significant redemptions on this particular day. ETF Name Net Outflow (Millions USD) Grayscale’s mini ETH $47.68 Bitwise’s ETHW $40.30 Grayscale’s ETHE $37.20 Invesco’s QETH $8.42 Fidelity’s FETH $6.17 Franklin Templeton’s EZET $5.37 VanEck’s ETHV $5.18 ARK 21Shares’ CETH $1.94 This table illustrates that Grayscale’s mini ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW led the redemptions, accounting for a significant portion of the total Ethereum ETF outflows . The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating that the outflows were concentrated among specific products. Why Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows Happening? Decoding the Market Signals. Understanding the catalysts behind such significant Ethereum ETF outflows is crucial for investors and market participants. Several factors could contribute to these movements, often reflecting broader market sentiment or individual investor strategies: Profit-Taking: After periods of positive price performance for Ethereum, some investors might opt to realize their gains. This is a common practice in any investment market, where assets are sold after reaching a desired profit margin, leading to redemptions from ETF holdings. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall mood in the cryptocurrency market plays a significant role. Concerns about macroeconomic conditions, shifts in global financial policies, or even a general downturn in risk appetite can lead investors to reduce their exposure to more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutional investors and even savvy individual investors regularly rebalance their portfolios to maintain specific asset allocations. These Ethereum ETF outflows could be a result of a strategic decision to adjust exposure to digital assets in favor of other asset classes, or vice versa, depending on their investment objectives. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains in flux. Any perceived shift in regulatory stance or new commentary from authorities could trigger caution among investors, leading to a reduction in their holdings. Competition from Direct Holdings: Some investors might choose to hold Ethereum directly on exchanges or through other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, especially if they seek greater control, lower fees, or access to staking rewards not always available through ETFs. The Immediate Impact: How Do Ethereum ETF Outflows Affect the Market? When significant Ethereum ETF outflows occur, they can send ripples through the market. The most immediate effect is often a bearish signal, which can exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price in the short term. This is because fund managers, to meet redemption requests, may need to sell a portion of their underlying Ethereum holdings, thereby increasing selling pressure on the open market. Beyond price action, these outflows can also influence investor confidence. Sustained periods of redemptions might make new investors hesitant to enter the market through these ETF vehicles, perceiving a lack of momentum or underlying weakness. However, it is important to note that the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market is substantial. While $152.26 million is a considerable sum for a single day, the market’s ability to absorb such movements without a drastic price collapse speaks to its growing maturity and depth. Broader Context: Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows a Trend or an Anomaly? While the $152.26 million outflow is significant, ranking as the third-highest, it is essential to place these Ethereum ETF outflows within a broader historical context. Such movements are not entirely unprecedented in the world of exchange-traded funds, particularly in nascent asset classes like cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin ETFs have also experienced periods of substantial outflows, especially during broader market corrections or shifts in investor sentiment. These ebbs and flows are a natural part of capital movement in dynamic financial markets. The very nature of ETFs, designed for liquidity and ease of trading, means that capital can move in and out relatively quickly. Therefore, a single day’s outflow, while notable, does not necessarily dictate a long-term trend. Instead, it often reflects a snapshot of market sentiment and investor reactions to prevailing conditions. Understanding these patterns helps investors maintain perspective and avoid overreacting to short-term events, recognizing that market cycles involve both inflows and outflows. Navigating the Current Climate: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Ethereum ETF Outflows. For investors currently holding or considering investments in spot Ethereum ETFs, these recent Ethereum ETF outflows offer several key considerations and actionable insights: Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets, including those influenced by ETFs, are known for their volatility. Focusing on the long-term potential of the Ethereum ecosystem and its technological advancements, rather than short-term price fluctuations, can be a more effective strategy. Prioritize Diversification: As with any investment, diversification remains a cornerstone of prudent portfolio management. Spreading investments across different asset classes and within the crypto space can help mitigate risks associated with the performance of a single asset or ETF. Implement Robust Risk Management: Investors should only invest capital they can comfortably afford to lose. Defining clear entry and exit strategies, setting stop-loss orders, and regularly reviewing one’s risk tolerance are crucial steps in managing exposure to volatile assets. Stay Informed and Conduct Due Diligence: The cryptocurrency market evolves rapidly. Staying abreast of regulatory news, broader market sentiment, and fundamental developments within the Ethereum network is vital. Informed decisions are always the best decisions. The Road Ahead: What Do These Ethereum ETF Outflows Mean for the Future of Digital Asset Investments? The recent Ethereum ETF outflows underscore the dynamic and maturing nature of the digital asset investment landscape. While significant, these movements are part of a broader process where cryptocurrencies are increasingly integrated into traditional financial products. The approval and launch of spot Ethereum ETFs themselves represented a major milestone, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for a wider audience to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. This institutional embrace is a long-term positive, even if it comes with the typical market behaviors seen in traditional finance, including periods of profit-taking and rebalancing. Looking forward, the long-term success of spot Ethereum ETFs will hinge on their ability to attract sustained inflows over time, proving their utility as mainstream investment vehicles. As the market continues to mature and regulatory clarity improves, these products could play an even larger role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. The journey of mainstream crypto adoption is still unfolding, and moments like these outflows provide valuable data points for its trajectory. Concluding Thoughts: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum ETFs The $152.26 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 1 serves as a crucial data point, highlighting a period of significant investor activity. While substantial, it is essential to view these Ethereum ETF outflows within the broader context of market cycles and evolving investor strategies. These events are not uncommon in nascent markets and can often provide valuable insights into market sentiment and liquidity dynamics. For the burgeoning world of digital asset investments, understanding these flows is key to navigating the path forward and appreciating the complex interplay of factors shaping the future of digital asset investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot Ethereum ETF? A: A spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that directly holds Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making it accessible to a broader range of investors. Q2: Why did U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experience significant outflows on August 1? A: The significant Ethereum ETF outflows on August 1 can be attributed to several factors, including profit-taking by investors after periods of price appreciation, broader negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, strategic portfolio rebalancing by large investors, or reactions to ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset space. Q3: How do these Ethereum ETF outflows impact the price of Ethereum? A: Large Ethereum ETF outflows can exert short-term downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. This is because ETF managers may need to sell a portion of their underlying ETH holdings to meet redemption requests, increasing the supply of ETH on the open market and potentially leading to a price decline. However, the overall impact depends on the market’s liquidity and demand. Q4: Is this a common occurrence for ETFs in general? A: Yes, outflows and inflows are a normal part of ETF operations, especially in volatile or new asset classes. ETFs are designed for liquidity, allowing investors to easily buy and sell shares. Periods of significant outflows can occur due to various market conditions, investor sentiment shifts, or rebalancing strategies, similar to traditional stock or bond ETFs. Q5: What should investors consider in response to these outflows? A: Investors should maintain a long-term perspective, focusing on Ethereum’s fundamental technology and ecosystem growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification across different assets, implementing sound risk management strategies, and staying informed about market trends and regulatory developments are also crucial considerations.

2025-08-02 05:42:07,49423634,1754113327,Here’s Why XRP Doesn’t Need to be Backed by Gold,"Versan Aljarrah, XRP community pundit and host of the Black Swan Capitalist, has explained how he believes XRP could gain exposure to gold. According to Aljarrah, this could happen not through a gold backing but with XRP acting as a bridge for gold-backed tokens on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). His comments follow a wave of community speculation suggesting XRP might eventually be tied to gold, an idea that has faced criticism for lacking technical support.How XRP Could Create a Synthetic Link to GoldIn his latest commentary , Aljarrah clarified that XRP doesn't need to carry a gold backing to benefit from its value. He believes XRP just needs to facilitate the movement of gold-pegged stablecoins on the XRPL. In doing so, XRP would gain a synthetic connection to tokenized assets like gold, oil, and others that enter the blockchain through XRPL. The market pundit sees this role as a way for XRP to cement its future relevance in global finance.Notably, while the XRPL has not welcomed a slew of gold-backed assets, Meld Gold is currently leading the effort. The company is currently looking to introduce a gold-backed stablecoin on the XRPL.https://twitter.com/meldgold/status/1799063771161502000For context, each token represents one gram of physical gold, stored securely by custodians such as MKS Pamp and Imperial Vaults. Meld Gold will allow the token to integrate real-world assets like gold and silver with XRPL's DeFi tools, including its built-in decentralized exchange.So far, Meld Gold is the only project looking to launch on the XRPL. Other gold-backed tokens, like PAX Gold (PAXG), hold strong reputations but haven't launched on XRPL yet. Aljarrah sees a future where there is a flood of such tokens on the XRPL.Persistent Calls for XRP to Bridge Gold-backed Tokens Notably, the Black Swan Capitalist host has persistently promoted the idea of XRP powering a gold-linked financial system. In May, he released a critique of today's monetary structure. Aljarrah argued that tokenizing gold on-chain, particularly on XRPL, could lead to a more transparent and stable financial system. In that setup, XRP would serve as the asset connecting these tokenized gold units.Meanwhile, five months ago, Aljarrah claimed that financial giants such as JP Morgan, BlackRock, the BIS, and the IMF had already made private decisions to place XRP at the center of a future monetary framework. While he suggested that XRP could act as the eventual bridge of this system, he failed to provide any evidence.Theories of XRP Receiving a Gold Backing Lack Technical SupportThese comments come as other community voices have floated theories of a future where XRP sees a gold backing. In February, Edoardo Farina from Alpha Lions Academy speculated that XRP could connect to U.S. gold reserves in Fort Knox. However, he admitted that his idea had no proof and remained purely theoretical.Also, earlier this year, several XRP community members suggested that XRP would be supported by the gold price of around $2,953 at the time. This idea gained traction across social media, but like others before it, it lacked any technical support.Matt Hamilton, former Director of Developer Relations at Ripple, has consistently pushed back against these claims. Starting in 2023, and continuing through 2024 and 2025, he firmly stated that XRP couldn't be backed by gold.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,1,versan aljarrah xrp community pundit host black swan capitalist explained belief xrp could gain exposure gold according aljarrah could happen gold backing xrp acting bridge token xrp ledger xrpl comment follow wave community speculation suggesting xrp might eventually tied gold idea faced criticism lacking technical xrp could create synthetic link goldin latest commentary aljarrah clarified xrp need carry gold backing benefit value belief xrp need facilitate movement stablecoins xrpl xrp would gain synthetic connection tokenized asset like gold oil others enter blockchain xrpl market pundit see role way xrp cement future relevance global xrpl welcomed slew asset meld gold currently leading effort company currently looking introduce stablecoin context token represents one gram physical gold stored securely custodian mks pamp imperial vault meld gold allow token integrate asset like gold silver xrpl defi tool including decentralized far meld gold project looking launch xrpl token like pax gold paxg hold strong reputation launched xrpl yet aljarrah see future flood token call xrp bridge token notably black swan capitalist host persistently promoted idea xrp powering financial system may released critique today monetary structure aljarrah argued tokenizing gold particularly xrpl could lead transparent stable financial system setup xrp would serve asset connecting tokenized gold five month ago aljarrah claimed financial giant jp morgan blackrock bi imf already made private decision place xrp center future monetary framework suggested xrp could act eventual bridge system failed provide xrp receiving gold backing lack technical supportthese comment come community voice floated theory future xrp see gold backing february edoardo farina alpha lion academy speculated xrp could connect gold reserve fort knox however admitted idea proof remained purely earlier year several xrp community member suggested xrp would supported gold price around time idea gained traction across social medium like others lacked technical hamilton former director developer relation ripple consistently pushed back claim starting continuing firmly stated xrp could backed gold,0.031,0.787,0.182,0.9908,1
2025-08-02 05:40:10,49402165,1754113210,US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Staggering $812 Million Exodus Raises Concerning Questions,"BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Staggering $812 Million Exodus Raises Concerning Questions The world of cryptocurrency is rarely dull, and August 1 proved to be a particularly eventful day for investors watching the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market. On this single day, these highly anticipated investment vehicles witnessed a combined net outflow of a staggering $812.27 million. This figure marks the highest daily net outflow observed over the past five months, sending ripples through the digital asset community. Understanding these significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile yet promising landscape of digital finance. US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Reach Record Highs: A Detailed Look The sheer scale of the US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1 caught many by surprise. According to data shared by Trader T on X, the total net outflow of $812.27 million represents a substantial movement of capital out of these funds. This event underscores the dynamic nature of institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated investment products. The outflows were not evenly distributed, with some funds experiencing far greater reductions in their holdings. This highlights varying investor behaviors and fund-specific dynamics within the broader market. Spot Bitcoin ETF Net Outflow (August 1) Fidelity (FBTC) $331.42 million ARK Invest (ARKB) $327.93 million Grayscale (GBTC) $66.79 million Bitwise (BITB) $38.27 million Grayscale Mini BTC $33.60 million Franklin Templeton (EZBC) $6.57 million Invesco (BTCO) $5.08 million BlackRock (IBIT) $2.61 million The table above details the significant outflows experienced by various U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 1. US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Staggering $812 Million Exodus Raises Concerning Questions Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB accounted for the majority of the outflows, signaling substantial position adjustments. While Grayscale’s GBTC also saw outflows, its proportional impact was less given its larger asset base. Several other ETFs, including Invesco’s BTCO and BlackRock’s IBIT, also reported net outflows, though on a smaller scale. Some ETFs reported no change in their holdings. Why Did US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Occur So Suddenly? The sudden surge in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows prompts an important question: what factors contributed to this significant capital movement? Market analysts and observers point to several potential reasons, often a combination of macro-economic shifts and specific cryptocurrency market dynamics. Profit-Taking: After periods of price appreciation, some investors may choose to realize profits. ETFs provide an easy mechanism for institutional and large-scale investors to do so. Broader Market Correction: The cryptocurrency market is subject to cycles of correction. A general downturn in investor sentiment or a specific crypto trigger could lead to reduced exposure. Macroeconomic Factors: Changes in interest rates, inflation data, or geopolitical events can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Rebalancing Strategies: Large institutional investors often rebalance their portfolios periodically to maintain a desired risk profile or align with new mandates. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fluid. New proposals or increased scrutiny could cause temporary pullbacks. A single day’s data, while significant, doesn’t always indicate a long-term trend. These outflows could be a one-off event driven by specific circumstances affecting a few large players, rather than a widespread loss of confidence. The Immediate Impact of US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows on the Market When significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows occur, the immediate impact on the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s price, can be noticeable. While direct causation is complex, a large outflow from these funds can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin in the underlying market. Here’s how these outflows can influence the market: Increased Selling Pressure: When investors redeem shares, the ETF provider typically sells a corresponding amount of Bitcoin to meet those redemptions. This adds to the supply, potentially driving down price. Shift in Market Sentiment: Large outflows can be interpreted as weakening institutional interest, leading to a decline in overall market sentiment and potentially triggering further selling. Liquidity Concerns: Very large, sudden outflows could test liquidity in certain trading pairs or at specific price levels. The market’s reaction is often a blend of direct selling impact and psychological impact from perceived trends. Traders and analysts closely monitor these flows as an indicator of institutional conviction. Navigating Volatility: Insights for Investors Amidst US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows For investors, understanding the implications of events like significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is key to making informed decisions. Market volatility is inherent in cryptocurrency, and reacting impulsively to daily fluctuations can harm long-term goals. Consider these insights when navigating market uncertainty: Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s price history shows cycles of rallies and corrections. Investors with a long-term horizon often view dips as opportunities. Diversification is Key: A diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or traditional assets can help mitigate risk during downturns. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Rely on multiple, credible sources. Understand the difference between short-term market noise and fundamental shifts. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):: Investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price can help smooth out volatility. While large outflows can be concerning, they are a natural part of a maturing market where institutional participants actively manage positions. Such events test market resilience and often precede periods of re-accumulation. What Lies Ahead for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Despite the recent surge in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows , the long-term outlook for these investment vehicles remains positive. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. was a landmark event, signifying a new era of institutional acceptance and accessibility for Bitcoin. Looking forward, several factors will likely shape the trajectory of these ETFs: Continued Institutional Adoption: As more financial advisors and institutional platforms integrate these ETFs, their reach and asset under management (AUM) are expected to grow. Market Maturation: As the crypto market matures, volatility may decrease, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a broader range of investors. Regulatory Clarity: Further regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies globally could boost investor confidence and attract more capital into regulated products. While a single day of significant outflows is noteworthy, it does not erase the fundamental importance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in bridging traditional finance with the digital asset world. They represent a crucial step towards mainstream adoption, offering a regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. In conclusion, the $812.27 million in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1 was a significant event, marking the highest daily net outflow in five months. Led primarily by Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB, these withdrawals highlight the dynamic nature of institutional investment in Bitcoin. While such movements can create short-term market pressure and shift sentiment, they are often attributable to factors like profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. For investors, maintaining a long-term perspective, diversifying portfolios, and conducting thorough research remain essential strategies for navigating the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The long-term trajectory for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to point towards their increasing role in mainstream finance, despite occasional periods of significant capital movement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the large US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1? The significant outflows on August 1 were likely caused by a combination of factors, including profit-taking by large investors after periods of Bitcoin price appreciation, portfolio rebalancing by institutional funds, and broader macroeconomic shifts influencing risk appetite. Which US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced the largest outflows? On August 1, Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB led with the largest net outflows, accounting for a substantial portion of the total $812.27 million. Grayscale’s GBTC also saw significant withdrawals. How do US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows affect Bitcoin’s price? Large outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin in the underlying market, as ETF providers sell Bitcoin to meet redemptions. This can lead to a short-term decrease in Bitcoin’s price and a shift in market sentiment. Are these outflows a sign of declining interest in Bitcoin ETFs? Not necessarily. While significant, these outflows could be part of normal market cycles, such as profit-taking or portfolio adjustments by large institutional players. They do not automatically indicate a long-term decline in interest. What should investors do in response to these significant outflows? Investors should avoid impulsive reactions. Instead, focus on a long-term investment strategy, consider diversifying portfolios, and conduct thorough research. Dollar-cost averaging can also be a useful strategy to mitigate volatility.

2025-08-02 05:36:48,49402088,1754113008,The U.S. is delaying thousands of export license approvals,"The U.S. government is delaying the approval of thousands of export license applications, leaving several American companies unable to ship products and technology abroad, including to China. Two sources knowledgeable of the situation explained these delays , stating that the government faces internal challenges threatening to stop the approval process completely. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a key figure in Trump’s trade negotiations and tariff policies, is now facing criticism. His department is being accused of stalling critical trade operations. His team has failed to release anticipated trade regulations, maintained minimal communication with industry stakeholders, and suffered a wave of resignations and buyouts that reduced its pool of specialized staff, crippling its ability to function effectively. BIS delays approval processes for export license applications Earlier, Nvidia announced that officials in Washington had promised to approve its shipments of AI chips to China. Examples of these officials include Lutnick. However, reports reveal that their license has been delayed, diminishing the U.S. companies’ hope to initiate distribution soon. Considering the situation, one of the U.S. officials acknowledged that this was the highest number of license applications in history. Lutnick’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) team also raised security concerns surrounding these license applications. In a statement, an anonymous official said the Bureau of Industry and Security is imposing strict regulations and aggressive enforcement to align with President Donald Trump’s trade policies—disrupting the market. Individuals who wished to expand their business overseas and tech companies that aimed for stringent export rules expressed their disappointment in the agency. According to them, this demonstrates a lack of action, yet the agency’s role is to enhance international trade. Meghan Harris, who worked as an official on the National Security Council during the first Trump administration, has commented on the matter. Harris noted that concerning the operation of enterprises within the United States, licensing as an activity supports the economy and reinforces the position of the U.S. as a trading superpower. Hence, in light of her reasoning, these delays and uncertainties about the licensing approval process are a net negative concerning many aspects of their economy. Jeffrey Kessler’s action raises controversy among individuals The licensing process is one of the U.S. rules in the export sector, to monitor the movement of sensitive products and tech devices from getting into the wrong hands, threatening the country’s security. In March, individuals raised concerns about BIS’s under-secretary, Jeffrey Kessler’s practices of micromanaging the bureau and his lack of effective communication. These concerns were raised after Kessler asked BIS staff to minimize communication with company spokespeople and industry executives during a staff meeting. Later, he asked that all meetings be noted in a spreadsheet. This also includes staff requesting permission from Kessler’s office to join meetings with other government agencies, an approval that is reportedly difficult to obtain. Concerning Kessler’s strict regulations on BIS, a representative from the agency acknowledged that this was for the good of BIS to maintain its integrity. In addition, the representative stated that it is due to his strict regulations that he has managed to win Lutnick’s trust. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

2025-08-02 05:30:29,49401857,1754112629,Pi Coin Breakout Incoming? New Listings Could Spark Surge in 2025,"Pi Network has just integrated TransFi, a secure fiat on‑ramp solution available to over 70 countries , supporting 40+ currencies and 250+ payment methods, including credit cards and Apple Pay. This move eliminates the multi‑step conversion process, letting users in developing markets access Pi directly and seamlessly. With trading volume surging toward $80 million , and a fully diluted valuation around $41.2 billion , the upgrade sets Pi up for broader mainstream participation. As investor enthusiasm shifts toward tokens with real liquidity paths and arrival potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly catching attention for reaching an all‑time peak in market visibility and community buzz. Listings, utility, and speculation: What may drive Pi toward $2 Currently trading in the $0.40–$0.41 range, Pi Coin’s next major move hinges on momentum from exchange listings and ecosystem expansion. Some analysts suggest a move toward $0.75 to $2 later in 2025 if global deployments and volume growth continue. Technically, price action has shown a breakout above the key $0.42 falling wedge – a chart pattern often signaling bullish reversal. However, risks remain, including rising exchange supply and user-reported wallet issues. Analysts recommend watching circulation data and listing confirmations closely. V isibility all-time high as demand surges While Pi Coin captures headlines for fiat onboarding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is celebrating its own breakthrough in early – phase momentum. In July, the project consistently topped crypto trend dashboards and saw record-breaking community growth across the industry. Whale investors are quietly accumulating, driving visibility and demand beyond typical retail activity. With early-access still open but nearing capacity, MAGACOIN’s rare mix of limited supply, rising buzz, and expanding utility mirrors setups that historically preceded major moves. For those timing cycles, it’s now one of the most structured asymmetric plays on the table. Timing and narrative: Where early-stage plays stand apart Success in crypto often comes from pairing narrative momentum with timing and scarcity—long before tokens hit major exchanges. Pi Coin now offers fiat access and regulatory momentum, but it may still be constrained by supply dynamics. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is weaving that narrative into its early phase – with chart trends and whale activity signaling shifting capital. In past cycles, projects like this amplified sharply once buy-side interest converged with limited entry . Watching for access window closing, surging buzz, and development updates may be the best way to separate lasting opportunities from fleeting hype. Conclusion: Access, visibility, and narrative in sharp focus Pi Coin’s integration with TransFi could mark the start of a new growth chapter. But in the background, MAGACOIN FINANCE is hitting all-time highs in market visibility – and entering what many believe is its last early-access window. Whether Pi approaches $2 or not, timing is everything right now. When visibility , buzz , and scarcity overlap, opportunities often favor those who act early. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is precisely the kind of asset positioning itself for a potential breakout as broader recognition still lags.

They’ll need to sort out these issues to stay competitive. 1xBet Grows 68% With Crypto Prizes And Esports Push 1xBet is gaining steam fast.

2025-08-02 05:00:28,49400523,1754110828,Crypto Analysts Reveal the Top Picks to Watch Before August Rally,"With the broader crypto market showing signs of recovery, investors are bracing for what many believe could be a decisive August rally. Historically, Q3 has often served as a catalyst for altcoin breakouts following summer consolidation. While Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range and Ethereum navigates ETF speculation, several under-the-radar altcoins are rapidly gaining traction – driven by community hype, viral narratives, and emerging utility. Crypto analysts are now paying close attention to five specific projects poised to outperform in the coming weeks. These coins represent a mix of meme-driven momentum, infrastructure utility, and cross-sector growth potential. One standout is MAGACOIN FINANCE, recently flagged by multiple analysts for its staggering 14,200% upside potential . Others, like PENGU and Jeo Boden, are riding powerful waves of community interest, while more technically grounded tokens like RNDR and SUI continue to expand through developer adoption and real-world applications. Here’s a closer look at the five altcoins analysts are closely watching before the next market breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Flag 14,200% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly risen through the ranks of trending crypto projects. Fueled by political appeal and a deeply engaged base, it has already surpassed several key presale milestones. Analysts project a possible 14,200% return , citing parallels to early-stage SHIB and DOGE cycles. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE goes beyond meme hype – it leverages scarcity-driven tokenomics, social referrals, and strategic deflation mechanisms that give it a unique edge in the crowded meme coin space. With viral content spreading across social media platforms, MAGACOIN is becoming a dominant force in the current presale cycle. Jeo Boden: A Political Meme Coin With Relentless Momentum Jeo Boden is a parody-driven meme coin inspired by political themes and Gen-Z humor. What started as a fringe project has now exploded across social media, consistently trending on DEXTools and amassing a loyal holder base. Its cultural relevance and satirical tone have fueled a wave of speculative buying. While it’s intentionally unserious in tone, traders are taking it seriously—many viewing it as a high-upside play in the meme coin narrative of 2025. PENGU: Meme-NFT Hybrid Making Exchange History PENGU has quickly cemented its status as one of the most exchange-listed meme tokens in recent memory. With over 130 listings and growing, PENGU blends NFT utility with meme coin virality. Its expansion into plush toys, NFT drops, and influencer partnerships makes it stand out from traditional meme projects. Analysts believe its ability to bridge Web3 culture with mainstream merchandising could give it longevity far beyond the current cycle. Render (RNDR): AI Infrastructure Backed by Real Demand Render is increasingly seen as one of the few AI-related crypto tokens with real-world utility. By decentralizing GPU rendering across creative industries, RNDR is building the backbone for future metaverse and AI integrations. As demand for AI infrastructure intensifies, Render’s growth in both institutional adoption and developer use cases makes it a reliable mid-cap play with long-term potential. SUI: A High-Speed Layer 1 Gaining Ecosystem Support SUI continues to attract developers and funding thanks to its focus on high throughput, fast finality, and user-friendly design. Developed by Mysten Labs, SUI offers a scalable alternative to congested Layer 1s like Ethereum. Its rapidly growing ecosystem and strong community support suggest it may be one of the best-positioned L1s heading into the next phase of market expansion. Conclusion: As August approaches, these five tokens are gaining momentum across different corners of the crypto world. Whether it’s the meme-powered explosion of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Jeo Boden, the NFT utility of PENGU, or the infrastructure strength of RNDR and SUI, each project is attracting serious analyst attention. MAGACOIN’s 14,200% upside potential stands out as one of the most aggressive forecasts—but in crypto, early conviction often leads to life-changing returns. With sentiment shifting bullish, positioning ahead of time may prove to be a winning strategy.

2025-08-02 05:00:14,49400472,1754110814,Why Solana Could Skyrocket: Multiple Asset Managers File Revised ETF Applications to SEC,"Solana (SOL) is attracting renewed institutional attention as major asset managers including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, VanEck, and Fidelity have updated their spot Solana ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Analyst Sees $5 Surge Any Moment – Details While the token’s price briefly dipped following the news, long-term indicators suggest this move could be a major bullish trigger. Asset Managers Revise Solana ETF Filings Amid SEC Dialogue As of August 1, at least seven asset managers submitted amended S-1 registration statements for Solana-based ETFs. These updates, which now include staking provisions and clearer custodianship structures, reflect ongoing discussions with the SEC. Notably, Grayscale’s updated proposal introduces a 2.5% annual fee in SOL, while VanEck’s version includes active staking rewards and dual custodianship. These moves are viewed as part of a coordinated strategy to align with SEC expectations, especially after the Commission recently approved in-kind redemption structures for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Market watchers believe a decision on Solana ETFs could arrive as early as late August or September 2025. SOL Price Reacts Cautiously, But Long-Term Momentum Builds Surprisingly, Solana’s price dropped by over 3% following the ETF filings, closing at $170.24. This suggests the news may already be priced in, or that traders remain cautious amid broader market uncertainty. Technical indicators show bearish momentum, with SOL struggling to stay above key support zones at $170 and $158. A close above $180 could reignite bullish sentiment, while a drop below $158 may signal a deeper correction toward $145 or $130. SOL's price moving sideways following a major price spike on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview What Solana ETF Approval Could Mean for SOL While short-term volatility persists, the broader implications of Solana ETF approval are substantial. A greenlight from the SEC could legitimize Solana as a mainstream investment asset, increase market liquidity, and open the door for more institutional adoption. With over $60 billion in staked SOL and a maturing ecosystem, Solana is well-positioned to benefit once regulatory clarity arrives.

2025-08-02 04:59:29,49400462,1754110769,UK households are £11 billion worse off despite four rate cuts,"One year has passed since BoE began cutting interest rates, yet British households continue to feel the pressure from high borrowing costs. Bloomberg’s review of Bank of England data showed that despite four rate cuts since July last year and more likely to come, households are about $14.5 billion worse off each year than 12 months ago. This shortfall comes even though the Monetary Policy Committee cut its key rate from 5.25% over that period. Savers have felt the pinch as banks and cut rates on deposits, reducing returns on cash. Homeowners have not seen similar relief, since many are on mortgage deals agreed at the peak of borrowing costs and must wait for those terms to expire. These numbers underline the challenge for policymakers to reduce pressure for households and revive the weak growth in Britain, as they work to reduce the benchmark rate that was at 5.25% a year ago, highest since the global credit crunch. Earlier in April, Cryptopolitan reported that the Bank of England cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25%. Consumer spending makes up about 60% of the UK economy, and any recovery hinges on people spending more. But many remain cautious, saving money amid fears of further tax rises in the autumn. A GfK savings index rose in July to its strongest level since 2007. Bank of England to cut another 0.25 percentage point off the main rate The Bank of England is expected to shave another 0.25 percentage point off its main rate, taking it to 4% this Thursday with signs of the labor market is cooling following Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ April tax increases and rising global trade tensions. Yet inflation is at a 17-month high, running hotter than the Bank forecast in May. Governor Andrew Bailey is expected to urge caution on further easing. While energy bills and other temporary factors have driven prices up, officials fear that higher wage demands could push costs even higher. Lower rates have cost savers nearly £5 billion in lost earnings on cash deposits, including tax-free Individual Savings Accounts as well as time and sight accounts, based on the total stock of deposits and effective rates through the last year. Furthermore, households are paying about £6 billion more each year in interest on unsecured debts and mortgages than they were 12 months ago. In comparison, the US household debt also hit a record $18.2 trillion, based on an earlier report by Cryptopolitan . The Bank warns more borrowers will shift onto higher rates in the coming months, estimating that a typical homeowner could pay about £1,300 extra a year in mortgage costs over the coming 2 years. Approximately 1 million people have fixed deals above today’s rates and must wait before benefiting from cheaper credit. Since July 2024, just before the first cut, the average rate rose by about 0.2 percentage points on on the UK’s mortgage stock. Economists expect the Bank of England to stick to its easing cycle once every quarter, taking rates to approximately 3.5% by spring, 2026. Get seen where it counts.

2025-08-02 04:55:10,49400217,1754110510,"Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $114,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $114,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with monumental news: Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved an astonishing milestone, soaring past the $114,000 mark. This incredible achievement, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at $114,000 on the Binance USDT market. This unprecedented Bitcoin Price Surge marks a pivotal moment, capturing the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts globally. It signifies not just a numerical ascent but a profound shift in market sentiment and the digital asset’s growing influence in global finance. This article delves into the significance of this surge, the forces propelling it, potential challenges, and what it might mean for the future of the crypto landscape. What Does This $114,000 Milestone Mean for the Bitcoin Price Surge? Reaching $114,000 is far more than just another price point for Bitcoin; it is a powerful statement about its enduring strength and potential. This level represents a new frontier, challenging previous expectations and setting a new benchmark for digital asset valuation. Its implications are multi-faceted: Psychological Breakthrough: Surpassing such a significant figure often triggers a psychological cascade, encouraging more investors to enter the market, fearing they might miss out on further gains. It reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value. Increased Mainstream Validation: Each new all-time high attracts greater media attention and public discussion, further cementing Bitcoin’s legitimacy in mainstream finance. This validates the asset for institutional and retail investors alike. Enhanced Market Capitalization: A higher price directly translates to a larger market capitalization, making Bitcoin a more substantial asset class comparable to traditional financial instruments and even major corporations. Liquidity and Trading Volume: Price surges typically correlate with increased trading activity, boosting liquidity across exchanges and making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. This momentous rise suggests a robust underlying demand and a maturing market infrastructure capable of supporting such valuations. The Bitcoin Price Surge at this level indicates strong conviction among holders and a willingness to acquire the asset at higher prices. Key Drivers Behind the Unprecedented Bitcoin Price Surge Several powerful forces have converged to propel Bitcoin to this extraordinary valuation. Understanding these drivers is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of the current market rally: Driver Impact on Bitcoin Price Surge Institutional Adoption Major financial institutions, corporations, and hedge funds are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class. This influx of large capital significantly boosts demand and stability. Macroeconomic Factors Concerns over inflation, currency debasement, and global economic uncertainty push investors towards Bitcoin as a digital hedge or ‘digital gold,’ a safe haven asset. Supply Halving Events Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reduction (halving) decreases the rate at which new BTC enters circulation, creating scarcity. Reduced supply against consistent or rising demand naturally drives prices higher. Technological Advancements Ongoing improvements to Bitcoin’s network, such as the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, enhance its utility and scalability, making it more attractive for wider use. Retail Investor Interest Increased accessibility through user-friendly platforms and growing awareness contribute to a broad base of retail investors entering the market, adding significant buying pressure. These elements combine to create a powerful bullish momentum, demonstrating Bitcoin’s evolving role from a niche digital currency to a significant global financial asset, underpinning the current Bitcoin Price Surge . Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Risks for the Bitcoin Price Surge? While the recent surge is exciting, it is important to approach the market with a clear understanding of potential challenges and risks. Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant volatility, and a price point of $114,000 does not eliminate this inherent characteristic. Investors should be aware of: Market Corrections: Sharp rallies are often followed by corrections as profits are taken. A significant price drop after a peak is a normal market behavior. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could impact market sentiment and price. Security Concerns: While Bitcoin’s blockchain is secure, individual exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacks, leading to potential loss of funds. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin (whales) can significantly influence market prices through their buying and selling activities, creating unpredictable swings. Economic Headwinds: Broader economic downturns or shifts in global monetary policy could impact investor appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Prudent investors consider these factors and implement risk management strategies to protect their portfolios, even amidst a powerful Bitcoin Price Surge . Actionable Insights for Investors: Capitalizing on the Bitcoin Price Surge For those looking to engage with Bitcoin during this exciting period, a strategic approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing, thoroughly research Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and historical performance. Understand what you are investing in. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a single large investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility and can be effective during a Bitcoin Price Surge or downturns. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one asset. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies or traditional assets can help manage risk. Set Clear Investment Goals: Define your investment horizon (short-term vs. long-term) and your risk tolerance. This will guide your decisions during market fluctuations. Secure Your Holdings: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings to enhance security against cyber threats. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, market analysis, and regulatory updates. Knowledge is power in a rapidly evolving market. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results. Investment in cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks, and it is possible to lose capital. The Future Outlook: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Surge? With Bitcoin now firmly established above $114,000, the question on everyone’s mind is: what comes next? While no one can predict the future with certainty, several factors suggest continued growth and evolution for Bitcoin. The trend of institutional adoption is expected to accelerate. As more traditional financial products tied to Bitcoin emerge (e.g., ETFs), accessibility for a broader range of investors will increase. This could lead to even greater capital inflows and potentially sustain the Bitcoin Price Surge over the long term. Furthermore, as global economies continue to navigate complex challenges, Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, scarce asset may become even more appealing as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Technological developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as advancements in scaling solutions and enhanced privacy features, will also play a role in its future utility and adoption. As the network becomes more efficient and user-friendly, its appeal for everyday transactions could grow, further solidifying its position. However, the path forward will likely not be linear. Regulatory clarity, global economic conditions, and technological competition will all influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Despite potential short-term fluctuations, the fundamental drivers of scarcity, decentralization, and increasing utility position Bitcoin for a significant role in the future of finance. Bitcoin’s journey to $114,000 is a testament to its growing influence and the evolving landscape of digital finance. Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $114,000 The monumental rise of Bitcoin past $114,000 is a truly historic moment in the cryptocurrency landscape. It underscores the growing confidence in digital assets and Bitcoin’s unique position as a leader in this financial revolution. While the journey has been marked by volatility, the underlying strength, increasing adoption, and fundamental drivers suggest a future where Bitcoin continues to challenge traditional financial paradigms. This incredible Bitcoin Price Surge is not just a fleeting event but a significant indicator of a maturing asset class poised for continued relevance and impact in the global economy. As the market evolves, staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective remains paramount for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does the $114,000 price point signify for Bitcoin? The $114,000 price point signifies a new all-time high and a major psychological breakthrough for Bitcoin. It demonstrates strong market confidence, increased institutional and retail adoption, and reinforces its growing status as a significant global asset class. What are the primary factors driving the current Bitcoin Price Surge? Key drivers include increased institutional investment, macroeconomic concerns leading investors to seek hedges against inflation, Bitcoin’s supply halving events reducing new supply, ongoing technological improvements to the network, and growing retail investor interest and accessibility. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after such a significant price increase? Investing in Bitcoin always carries risks. While the price has surged, many analysts believe Bitcoin has long-term growth potential. It is crucial to conduct your own research, understand your risk tolerance, and consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) rather than making a single large investment. What are the main risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility at this level? Despite the high price, Bitcoin remains volatile. Risks include potential sharp market corrections, evolving regulatory landscapes, security vulnerabilities (like exchange hacks), and the influence of large holders (whales) on price movements. It is important to manage risk and only invest what you can afford to lose. How does institutional adoption influence Bitcoin’s value? Institutional adoption significantly influences Bitcoin’s value by bringing substantial capital, increased liquidity, and mainstream legitimacy to the market. When large financial entities and corporations invest, it signals confidence and can lead to sustained demand and price stability over time. What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin after this surge? The long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains largely positive, driven by its finite supply, decentralization, and increasing utility. Continued institutional interest, technological advancements, and its role as a potential hedge against traditional financial instability are expected to support its growth, though price movements will likely remain volatile.

2025-08-02 04:30:28,49399257,1754109028,Top 3 Cryptos Under $1 That Could Explode This Quarter,"Investor capital is increasingly moving away from the saturated top coins and rotating into new altcoins with viral potential and narrative structure. Pressure on liquidity and whale rebalancing are drawing sharp attention to assets that combine limited access with growth momentum—and as a result, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been quietly generating buzz with whale demand surging behind it. Pepe (PEPE) gains renewed traction amid meme resurgence Pepe Coin (PEPE) recently jumped approximately 20% in a month, signaling renewed interest among meme‑coin traders. It has rebounded from a key support level, with bullish price action driving renewed momentum. Analysts caution that its massive supply caps higher price targets, but the burst in social activity and retail attention suggests it remains a powerful play for short‑term volatility. MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerates as whale-led demand spikes While these smaller meme coins draw bigger attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing backdoor accumulation from whale investors, helping drive its momentum into overdrive. Whales are accumulating , and demand for early access is rising rapidly across wallet signups, community activity, and trending charts. The project’s structured early-access system – exclusive entry open now but nearing capacity – paired with growing utility and ecosystem momentum, positions it as one of the few tokens remaining where timing still matters. For investors seeking big gains, this is a standout setup fueled by calculated capital behavior, not just hype . Bonk (BONK) builds momentum ahead of supply‑reduction catalyst Bonk (BONK), trading under $1, continues to gain traction as it approaches the milestone of 1 million on-chain holders, which will trigger a planned 1 trillion token burn, reducing overall supply. The token surged recently, supported by on-chain growth and hype around deflationary mechanics, though some retracement is expected at resistance around $0.00003. Why the sub‑$1 bracket is catching smart money History shows that the most explosive gains in crypto often come from coins trading at cents , not dollars. When liquidity exits large caps, it tends to flow into early‑stage projects with strong narratives and limited cap exposure. Investors now prioritize transparent token structures, growing engagement, and strategic access phases – benchmarks seen across the top performers of past cycles. Conclusion: Keep your radar tight on under‑$1 setups Sector momentum is real—but for those with capital ready and patience intact, under‑$1 tokens like PEPE and BONK may deliver fast-moving gains. Even more compelling is MAGACOIN FINANCE, whose whale-led demand and fast‑filling access window combine scarcity with structure. In a market where meaningful upside often occurs before visibility peaks, acting now may give you a tactical edge as the sector cycles again.
