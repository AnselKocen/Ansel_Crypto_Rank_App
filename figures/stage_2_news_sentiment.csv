The company announced that it will adopt BNB as its primary treasury reserve asset with the funding. The strategic investment round was led by YZi Labs, the family office of Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. More than 140 leading investors, including Pantera Capital, GSR, Borderless Capital, Arrington Capital, Blockchain.com, Hypersphere Capital, dao5, Protocol Ventures, and Three Point Capital, participated in the funding round. CEA Industries' major financing move comes just one week after it announced a $500 million capital raise on July 28. Following the announcement, the company's stock has surged over 600% and is currently trading around $17.50. This increase brings the company's market capitalization to approximately $15 million.

The funds raised will be used directly to purchase BNB tokens, and the strategy will revolve around the BNB Chain ecosystem. While continuing its traditional business activities, CEA also plans to build a BNB-focused treasury structure. Along with this strategic transformation, the company has also restructured its senior management team. David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital and senior partner at 10X Capital, has been appointed CEA's new CEO. Russell Read, CIO of 10X Capital and former CIO of CalPERS, has been appointed CIO.

Can It Push Further?,"Pump.fun’s $PUMP token gained 5.5% to $0.003154 as whale activity and buybacks countered a 67% post-launch crash and a billion-dollar lawsuit threat. Behind the price movement, conflicting forces are at work. While venture firms accumulate tokens and derivatives activity grows, the platform battles legal challenges, and rivals are gaining market share. Source: CoinGecko Pump.fun Faces Legal Heat and Competition But Indicates Recovery as Ecosystem Evolves Launched through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on July 12, 2025, Pump.fun sold 15% of its total 1 trillion token supply , amounting to 150 billion PUMP tokens. The token sale drew considerable attention and indicated the platform’s ambition to be more than just a memecoin incubator. Shortly after its debut, $PUMP plummeted 67% from its peak. This decline has put pressure on the platform to innovate and reinforce its value proposition to the market. To restore confidence, the project initiated its buyback program, where it repurchased $31.3 million worth of $PUMP tokens funded by 25% of the protocol revenue. Pump.fun also acquired Kolscan, a leading on-chain wallet tracking tool, to improve transparency and attract serious meme investors. we’re excited to announce that pump fun has acquired @kolscan Kolscan is a wallet tracker that monitors the activities of top onchain traders. it provides realtime transactions, token PnL, and a leaderboard ranking their performance our integration will not only enable better… pic.twitter.com/V4VDcOwVeG — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) July 10, 2025 Yet, just as the project sought stability, a class-action lawsuit was filed by Burwick Law, claiming Pump.fun operates like an “illegal casino” that encourages speculative memecoin gambling. The lawsuit seeks $5.5 billion in damages, a massive legal challenge that could impact the platform’s long-term regulatory standing and public perception. Pumpdotfun Litigation Update Burwick Law, on behalf of plaintiffs, filed a new complaint in federal court in the Southern District of New York alleging RICO claims against Anatoly Yakavenko, Raj Gokal, Dan Albert, Lily Liu, Austin Federa, Solana Labs, Solana Foundation, Alon… — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) July 23, 2025 Despite the setbacks, Pump.fun is fighting back. The asset saw an 11% growth in price on the back of bullish fundamentals and aggressive whale accumulation. According to on-chain activity, venture firm GSR purchased $4.6 million worth of PUMP from exchanges, indicating institutional interest. At the same time, open interest in PUMP derivatives rose 6%, hitting $743 million, while the funding rate flipped positive. But competition is heating up in the meme launchpad space. Rivals like LetsBonk.fun are gaining ground rapidly, forcing Pump.fun to double up on its buyback strategy, acquisitions, and product rollout. $PUMP Pulls Back After Hitting Measured Target With Triple Bottom Breakout Earlier today, $PUMP/USDT pulled back from its intraday high near $0.00338 after a clean breakout from a well-formed triple bottom pattern on the 1H chart. The pattern had formed starting from late July into early August, with well defined reaction lows and an ascending neckline. After the third bottom near $0.00260, we saw $PUMP break out with strength, tapping the projected upside target around $0.00336 before losing steam. $PUMP/USDT price chart, August 5 (Source: TradingView) The traded volume increased steadily during the breakout leg, confirming participation behind the move. However, the latest session reveals a shift. Volume footprint data shows that although total volume remained high across most of the session, particularly between 08:00 and 10:00 UTC, where 16.65B were traded, the delta has turned less favorable. In addition, a large red delta candle printed after the high, with over -53.4M delta on 7.84B total volume. That shift reflects aggressive selling into local strength. Earlier in the move, between 06:00 and 09:00 UTC, the delta skewed heavily bullish, with back-to-back prints over +1.19B, +1.35B, and +1.31B. These coincided with the main thrust out of the base. But since tapping the projected target, price action has flattened, and the most recent deltas show mild selling with less follow-through from buyers. Right now, $PUMP is holding above $0.00304, which is a good enough short-term level to watch. If that gives way, the next support sits around $0.00295. On the upside, reclaiming $0.00320 with strong volume could put bulls back in control. But for now, this looks like a classic case of a pattern that hit its target and is taking a moment to reset.

2025-08-05 18:15:11,49594853,1754417711,"Final Presale Rounds? Arctic Pablo’s 1,026% ROI Tempts Investors—Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now as Shiba Inu and Fartcoin Spike","Could missing this meme coin presale mean skipping a life-changing opportunity? With the crypto spotlight swinging back to community-driven tokens, the market is buzzing once again. In this frenzy, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is lighting up discussions with a powerful presale surge and head-turning features. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu holds its ground with an impressive 24-hour volume, and Fartcoin’s price breakout is adding fire to meme coin conversations. But in the middle of these movers, Arctic Pablo Coin is climbing with unmatched momentum—and the presale is inching toward its final stages. Acting late might mean entering too high. Are you really willing to risk watching another coin 10x without you? This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Fartcoin. Battle for the Blockchain Spotlight: Community Challenges Spark Buzz One of the most exciting features of Arctic Pablo Coin is its Community Competitions, where users can earn APC tokens or even USD rewards by participating in engaging tasks. But here’s what makes it different—this isn’t just some referral system in disguise. It’s a gamified, reward-based model that drives true community engagement and growth. Think about it: what other project gives real-world value just for showing off your meme skills or sharing a tweet? Whether you’re a digital artist, trader, or content wizard, these competitions make Arctic Pablo Coin a platform to earn while you engage. Could this be the crypto that finally merges fun with function? Many believe it’s more than just a token—it’s a movement. And as Arctic Pablo shines among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now , early backers are already reaping the rewards. How many projects reward you before launch? That’s the kind of question APC answers daily. $3.23M Raised and Climbing: Just One More Stage Before Arctic Pablo’s Price Launches The meme coin presale momentum around Arctic Pablo Coin is electrifying. The project has now hit Stage 35 (Firefrost Flats) with a price of just $0.00071 per APC. Over $3.23 million has been raised—an unmistakable signal of investor trust and growing excitement. Let’s run the numbers: Buy 1,760,000 APC for just $1,250. When APC hits the listing price of $0.008, your investment turns into $14,080. That’s a clean ROI of 1,026.76%—and it doesn’t stop there. If analysts’ predictions of a $0.10 valuation hold true, the ROI shoots up to 13,984.50%. Even those who entered in earlier stages have already seen 4,633.33% gains, making it one of the most profitable meme coin presales this year. So ask yourself: Are you buying before the breakout or waiting to chase it at the top? There are only a few stages left. Entry at this point could be the closest thing to catching lightning in a bottle. Arctic Pablo shines among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now—but not for long. Shiba Inu Price Action Holds Strong: Market Liquidity Says It All The live Shiba Inu price today stands at $0.000013, accompanied by a staggering 24-hour trading volume of $162,625,397. While price movements remain within tight bands, this massive liquidity points to one thing: strong community interest and whale attention. Shiba Inu may not be launching a new token, but the steady pulse of its ecosystem makes it a resilient force in the meme economy. It’s the kind of token that’s not trying to win the race—but still keeps finishing among the leaders. With volume this high, could a breakout be on the cards? In the crypto jungle, those who hesitate miss the lion’s share. As Shiba keeps drawing eyes, don’t sleep on what this momentum might signal. Time waits for no trader. Blink, and you might miss it. Fartcoin Fires Up: Price Hits $1.03 as Trading Volume Explodes Past $205M Fartcoin is laughing at the blockchain. Currently priced at $1.03, its daily volume has rocketed to $205,402,324, signaling a roaring uptick in market participation. Though the name might raise eyebrows, the numbers demand respect. The Fartcoin community isn’t just large—it’s loyal and loud. A combination of viral marketing and timed announcements is keeping the momentum high, making Fartcoin a standout in meme coin circles. Can it maintain this surge? Possibly. It’s already proven its resilience through volatile swings. And now, with traders piling in, the question becomes: will you ride the wave or watch it crash into profits without you? Opportunities like these pass by like a gust of wind—strong, sudden, and easy to miss. Final Verdict: Arctic Pablo’s Presale is the Lightning Strike All three coins—Shiba Inu, Fartcoin, and Arctic Pablo Coin —are making waves. Shiba’s volume remains unshakable, and Fartcoin’s market presence is undeniable. But Arctic Pablo Coin stands in a class of its own, not just for what it offers now, but for what it promises tomorrow. Its community-powered competitions, ultra-low presale pricing, and jaw-dropping ROI potential have created a perfect storm of investor interest. And with just a few stages left, the time to move is vanishing. The $0.008 listing price is around the corner. Those who wait might enter at the peak, while others will have already locked in life-altering returns. Arctic Pablo shines among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and this presale may be the last golden window. Don’t just observe—act before the page turns on this chapter of gains.

2025-08-05 18:12:13,49594741,1754417533,SEC Says Liquid Staking and Receipt Tokens May Not Be Securities Under Certain Structures,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance published a detailed statement on Tuesday clarifying its views on “liquid staking,” a type of crypto protocol staking where users receive newly minted tokens representing staked assets. In a statement, the SEC said the guidance seeks to help crypto participants understand whether these arrangements fall under U.S. securities laws. BREAKING from @SECGov : Liquid staking activities and tokens are not considered securities pic.twitter.com/POcFywU6X7 — Solana (@solana) August 5, 2025 According to the Division, under specific conditions, liquid staking activities and the associated receipt tokens do not involve the offer or sale of securities and therefore do not require SEC registration. Understanding Liquid Staking and Receipt Tokens In a liquid staking setup, crypto holders deposit their assets with a third-party or protocol-based provider and receive “staking receipt tokens” in return. These tokens serve as proof of ownership for the deposited crypto and any rewards earned through staking. Unlike traditional staking, liquid staking allows users to retain liquidity—the receipt tokens can be used in other crypto applications or redeemed later, subject to protocol conditions such as “unbonding” periods. These arrangements can be facilitated either programmatically through self-executing code (protocol-based) or via custodians who manage wallets and interact with staking protocols on behalf of users. In either case, users maintain ownership of their deposited assets throughout the staking process. SEC’s Position: No Securities Involved in Liquid Staking The SEC’s Division explains that the actions undertaken in these liquid staking arrangements—including the minting, issuing, and redeeming of staking receipt tokens—do not meet the legal definition of a securities offering, as long as the deposited assets themselves are not securities or part of an investment contract. This determination hinges on the absence of entrepreneurial or managerial efforts by the Liquid Staking Provider. Providers are not seen as actively managing the user’s investment but merely performing administrative or ministerial functions such as staking the assets or selecting node operators. Therefore, the economic benefits to users arise directly from the staking activity itself, not from the provider’s business efforts—a key distinction under the Howey Test used to identify investment contracts. Howey Test Analysis and the Role of the Provider The SEC applies the Howey Test to evaluate whether an arrangement constitutes an investment contract. The test looks for three elements: an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. In the case of liquid staking, the Division stresses that the provider’s role is limited to technical facilitation rather than strategic decision-making. Receipt Tokens Are Not Securities The SEC also addressed the nature of staking receipt tokens themselves. While they are receipts that confirm ownership of deposited crypto, they are not receipts for securities unless the underlying assets qualify as such. These tokens do not independently generate rewards; instead, their value reflects the performance of the staked assets. As long as the structure avoids reliance on managerial efforts and adheres to the described protocols, the SEC does not consider these tokens to be part of a securities offering. The agency cautions, however, that any deviation from these parameters—particularly where providers play a larger, more entrepreneurial role—could change the regulatory outcome. This statement, therefore, offers a framework for compliance but not a blanket exemption. SEC Launches ‘Project Crypto’ Initiative SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced the launch of “ Project Crypto ” on July 31, a comprehensive initiative designed to modernize securities regulations and allow America’s financial markets to move on-chain.

2025-08-05 18:05:34,49594472,1754417134,Analyst Who Called XRP Rally from $0.5 Sets 2-Digit Top With This Warning,"Renowned market analyst JD has once again captured the spotlight with a bold prediction about XRP. Known for accurately forecasting XRP’s rise from $0.50 and its previous crash to $0.28, JD now says the token is headed into double-digit territory —but warns a devastating 90% crash will follow once the peak is confirmed. JD’s Proven Track Record and New Forecast JD has earned credibility in the XRP community for calling key market turns. His latest update projects that XRP is on course to surge into the two-digit price range, potentially targeting levels around $17 . This outlook is based on historical technical patterns and market structure signals. According to JD, the same strategy that helped him call XRP’s 70% crash to $0.28 is now guiding his plan for the coming rally and subsequent collapse. His warning is clear: take calculated profits as XRP climbs. Once the top is confirmed, he expects a violent retracement similar to previous bear markets. My top is in the 2 digits for $XRP But make sure to take calculated profits! Once we confirmed TOP.. I'm calling the 90% crash! Will use exact same strategy when I called the bottom 70% crash to 0.28! But will use a PINK BOX instead of ORANGE #xrparmy #XRPCommunity https://t.co/UHcWik6dP2 — JD (@jaydee_757) August 4, 2025 Technical Setups Point to Explosive Upside JD’s forecast is anchored in strong technical analysis. He highlights a newly formed hidden bullish divergence on XRP’s two-week chart—something he previously identified before XRP’s massive 2017 rally. He also points to a breakout from a long-standing symmetrical triangle, a pattern that historically signals the start of major price expansions. If the current trend mirrors previous cycles, JD believes XRP could exceed its all-time high and enter the $10–$20 range before topping out. However, he emphasizes that such a move will likely be followed by a steep collapse, wiping out up to 90% of those gains for unprepared holders. Emphasis on Profit-Taking and Risk Management A central message in JD’s post is the importance of profit-taking. Rather than holding blindly for extreme highs, JD encourages traders to secure gains gradually as XRP climbs. This measured approach is based on hard lessons from previous cycles, where traders who failed to exit near the top faced crippling losses in the aftermath. His strategy includes watching for top confirmation signals and scaling out of positions before the broader market turns. JD warns that ignoring these signs could leave investors trapped in a brutal correction that may push XRP back to low single-digit prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Wider Market Views and Analyst Consensus JD’s outlook aligns with other analysts forecasting dramatic moves for XRP. EGRAG Crypto has suggested a peak as high as $27 before a possible 85%–97% retracement. Meanwhile, others caution that despite the recent surge past $3, XRP still faces bearish signals such as the MVRV “death cross,” which could indicate cooling momentum. While predictions vary, most experts agree: XRP is entering a high-volatility phase, and only those with disciplined strategies will navigate it successfully. Final Thoughts JD’s call carries weight, not just because of his past accuracy, but because it reflects the cyclical nature of crypto markets. XRP may be poised for a historic rally, but with extreme upside comes equally severe downside risk. For traders, the message is simple: enjoy the rally, but don’t forget to take profits. Because if JD is right again, the crash that follows could be just as epic as the rise. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

It’s unclear the reason for the transfers, but it may indicate an intention to sell on behalf of clients. BlackRock uses Coinbase Prime for custody, sales and other services. The asset manager moved the Bitcoin in batches of 300 BTC and it moved Ethereum in multiple 10,000 ETH transactions. Meanwhile, Lookonchain reports institutional accumulation sprees of Ethereum have been surging. “Whales/institutions keep buying ETH!

2025-08-05 18:02:42,49594387,1754416962,Franklin Templeton’s Tokenized Money Market Fund Goes Live on BounceBit,"Franklin Templeton’s tokenized U.S. government money market fund is now live on BounceBit, the latest milestone in the arrival of real-world assets (RWA) into the crypto environment. BounceBit confirmed the integration on August 5 through its BounceBit Prime product, making the Blockchain Capital and YZi Labs-backed platform a new destination for structured yield strategies. Improving Capital Efficiency with Tokenized Assets Under the integration, Franklin Templeton’s fund is collateral and settlement on BounceBit Prime’s platform. The move enhances capital efficiency since investors can not only hold the yield-bearing asset but also use it in yield-bearing strategies across exchange venues. The tokenized fund offers a current yield of approximately 4.5%, offering double benefits to investors: a baseline yield from the fund itself as well as additional yield opportunity within the BounceBit ecosystem. BounceBit stated: This launch paves the way for what BB Prime will become: A venue for execution of tokenized RWA — backed by institutional-grade collateral and governed by programmable logic.” Franklin Templeton’s Onchain Growth Franklin Templeton launched the OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund in 2021, offering tokenized shares through the BENJI token. As of August 4, the fund is also supported by Anchorage Digital Bank and operates on Ethereum, Solana, Stellar, Avalanche, and VeChain. The fund holds $692 million in assets, rendering it among the biggest onchain institutional products of its kind. The Broader RWA Ecosystem BounceBit is among a growing number of players introducing tokenized RWAs to broader accessibility . Some of the other big names in the space include BlackRock, Fidelity, Janus Henderson, and Guggenheim Treasury. They are helping to grow the onchain market for a wide variety of assets, from U.S. Treasury debt to tokenized stocks, private credit, and corporate bonds. BounceBit is looking to launch its tokenized stock product in the U.S., Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan. That puts it in direct competition with the integration of platforms like Robinhood, which launched tokenized U.S. stocks on Arbitrum in July, and eToro, which made a similar announcement as well. Conclusion The integration of Franklin Templeton’s tokenized fund into BounceBit represents a watershed for the growth of the RWA market.

2025-08-05 18:00:32,49594284,1754416832,Market Expert Debunks Possible Bitcoin Top In November Using 9-12 Months Retail Cycle,"The debate around Bitcoin’s top for this cycle has been a major topic as market participants eye potential peaks later this year. Although some analysts have forecasted a blow-off top in October or November, Quinten Francois, a respected crypto market commentator, strongly disagrees. Drawing from historical data and market psychology, Francois believes that the current bull market is far from over and that expectations for a Q4 2025 top are “just not going to happen.” November Is Too Soon For A Bitcoin Peak Taking to the social media platform X, Bitcoin commentator Quinten argued that any expectations for a full market peak by November completely overlook how previous cycles have unfolded. He pointed out that in both 2017 and 2021, the altseason, the period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin, began in Q1 of those respective bull market years. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Loading As Bitcoin Dominance Crashes Toward 60% From that point, the retail-driven psychological cycle took roughly 9 to 12 months to fully play out. This time around, the analyst suggests that altseason hasn’t even started in earnest. The ETH/BTC ratio, often used as the criteria for altseason momentum, is only just beginning to reverse. Given this timing, Quinten noted that a cycle top occurring within the next two or three months is nearly impossible. The moment altseason begins marks the entry of broad retail participation, and from that point onward, it typically takes 9 to 12 months for euphoria and market excess to reach a crescendo. If history is any guide, the current psychological cycle is still in its early stages because the retail cycle hasn’t properly kicked in yet. This would push a market peak into the second or third quarter of 2026 at the earliest. Altcoin Cycle Will Determine If Peak Is Possible The only condition that could allow for a major top this year, Quinten admitted, would be an absence of an altcoin cycle altogether. That scenario, or a catastrophic black swan event, could short-circuit the retail cycle and lead to an earlier-than-usual top. However, the possibility of this happening is very low, and this psychological cycle simply cannot play out much quicker than 9-12 months. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Spikes Above 30, But Bitcoin Dominance Remains High, What Next? As such, Bitcoin’s price action is most likely to play out like it has always done. “If things unfold as they historically have (we can only count on this), then it’s just not going to happen,” he said. Although the analyst did not give a price target for the expected Bitcoin top for this cycle, other technical analysts have pointed to targets between $140,000 and $200,000. In another post on the social media platform, Quinten noted that Bitcoin is currently playing out its biggest bullish setup in history. This outlook is based on a current retest of an ascending trendline of all-time highs, which Bitcoin broke above in July. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $114,460, having declined by about 3.7% in the past seven days.

2025-08-05 18:00:19,49594484,1754416819,"Best Performing Cryptos in 2025 for 100x Growth: Cold Wallet, ADA, DOGE, & SOL!","In crypto, perfect timing often decides who gains big and who watches from the sidelines. With multiple major projects building momentum, choosing the best-performing cryptos in 2025 can mark the gap between minor returns and life-changing gains. Among these, Cold Wallet has started gaining traction for offering early participants an entry point that few projects can currently match. Below is a breakdown of four of the best-performing cryptos in 2025 that are worth watching closely, beginning with a lesser-known name already showing strong performance. Cold Wallet (CWT): Presale Gem Set to Deliver Huge Gains Cold Wallet stands out among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 due to its rare combination of utility, user rewards, and strong growth. In presale stage 16, CWT trades at $0.00942, a figure that becomes notable when compared to its confirmed listing value of $0.3517. This translates into a 37x potential even before market launch, with some projections suggesting the upside could extend to 100x based on projected traction. What gives Cold Wallet its real edge is not just pricing. It is a self-custody crypto wallet that pays its users back in CWT for every transaction, including swaps, gas fees, and entry/exit actions. There are no complex rules or lock-ins—users simply earn while they use. The cashback amount increases with how much CWT is held, with some users eligible for up to 100% gas refunds. The upside also gets a serious push from Cold Wallet’s $270 million takeover of Plus Wallet, which instantly brought in over 2 million users. More people using the platform means more activity. More activity leads to increased demand for the coin. As the rewards are given in CWT, it creates a loop of activity and demand that fuels growth. Having a functioning product, an effective reward model, and a referral program already paying in USDT, Cold Wallet is gaining traction fast. Its presale has already crossed over $5.7 million, selling more than 683 million coins. Cardano (ADA): Long-Term Growth Rooted in Academic Design Among the best-performing cryptos in 2025, Cardano remains a steady choice for those focused on consistency and technical depth. Its foundations are built on peer-reviewed principles and formal verification methods, which appeal to those who value reliability. While ADA may not deliver fast price spikes, its gradual rollout of smart contracts and governance tools continues to build a sustainable DeFi base. Ongoing developments like Layer 2 scaling through Hydra and increasing numbers of decentralized applications contribute to Cardano’s ongoing appeal. For those favoring solid growth over hype, ADA remains a solid contender. If decentralized identity and smart contract usage expand, Cardano could move past many current expectations. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still Powerful Thanks to Its Community and Reach Dogecoin keeps its spot on the list of best-performing cryptos in 2025 due to strong community backing and wide recognition. It started as a meme but quickly evolved into a recognized digital currency after being supported by Elon Musk and major exchanges. Known for its ease of use, very low fees, and strong online presence, it continues to appeal to a wide audience. Though newer digital assets have more advanced features, Dogecoin thrives because of its loyal user base. Plans to connect DOGE with Starlink for off-grid payments add a level of speculation that keeps the community involved. If we see another retail-driven cycle in 2025, DOGE could see a fresh wave of gains. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Chain With Strong Institutional Ties Solana secures a place among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 by combining high speed, low costs, and increasing real-world adoption. The network is known for fast transactions and has become a top choice for NFTs, consumer-facing applications, and high-speed DeFi protocols. Integration with Shopify through Solana Pay and increasing acceptance among physical retailers shows its practical appeal. Although the project encountered performance setbacks in 2022, it has recovered significantly due to growing developer contributions and better system reliability. With continuing upgrades and funding from major backers, Solana is in a strong position to grow, especially if apps requiring rapid processing become popular. To Sum Up! Cardano, Dogecoin, and Solana each represent solid choices among the best-performing cryptos in 2025. But none present the same early-stage growth window and built-in value loop that Cold Wallet does. With a strong product, working utility, and over 683 million coins already sold, CWT token presale gives users a chance to benefit from one of the rarest factors in crypto: time on their side. For those searching for 100x possibilities before mainstream entry, Cold Wallet might be the one that sets a new benchmark among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 .

2025-08-05 18:00:09,49594333,1754416809,"4 Coins to Buy Now: Cold Wallet’s $CWT, Cardano, Dogecoin, Solana Lead the Way","In crypto, timing often decides outcomes. With so many new and growing projects, knowing the top performing cryptos can help avoid short wins and aim for bigger gains. One name now drawing attention is Cold Wallet, offering buyers a strong price advantage before its public launch. Below are four of the top performing cryptos that stand out in today’s market, starting with a project that’s showing results before even hitting exchanges. Cold Wallet (CWT): Early-Stage Value Backed by Real Users Cold Wallet stands out as one of the top performing cryptos with a strong mix of rewards, real-world function, and growth potential. It is in presale stage 16 and priced at $0.00942. Compared to its set listing price of $0.3517, that gives buyers a 37x head start. Some even see a 100x gain possible with more traction. This project doesn’t rely on hype. Cold Wallet is a working self-custody wallet that gives users CWT tokens as cashback for gas fees, swaps, and even for moving money in or out. The more CWT you hold, the more you earn. At the highest level, gas fees are fully refunded. Fueling this growth is the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, which added over 2 million users. This boosts both transaction volume and token demand. The reward system, paid in CWT, helps strengthen usage and engagement. So far, Cold Wallet has raised $5.7 million in its crypto presale. With working systems, user rewards, and even USDT referral payouts, Cold Wallet is gaining momentum quickly. Cardano’s Careful Build Keeps It on the Radar Cardano has long been one of the top performing cryptos for those focused on the long term. Its design is based on peer-reviewed work and formal methods, appealing to those who value structure and dependability. ADA avoids fast spikes, instead building slow momentum through smart contract support and new tools for governance. With more dApps launching and Layer 2 projects like Hydra rolling out, Cardano still draws attention from those who prefer steady growth. If tools like smart contracts and digital ID services expand in usage, ADA may still have room to prove early support was worth it. Dogecoin Still Stands Thanks to Its Loyal Base Dogecoin remains on the list of top performing cryptos mostly because of its wide reach and strong online following. First created as a joke, DOGE got a serious push from Elon Musk and big-name platforms. With its low fees and easy use, it’s often the first coin that new users buy. Even though its design is basic compared to newer coins, the value of Dogecoin lies in its community. There are even plans to link it with Starlink for off-grid payments, keeping ideas flowing. If meme coins return to the spotlight in 2025, DOGE could once again ride that trend. Solana Gains Speed and Real-World Reach Solana is counted among the top performing cryptos due to its speed and low cost. It has become a key network for NFTs, fast DeFi tools, and apps built for daily use. Solana Pay, its Shopify plug-in, and retailers accepting SOL show how it is moving beyond just digital trading. After facing tech issues in 2022, Solana has bounced back with better performance and more active development. With strong backers and ongoing upgrades, SOL could benefit again if user-heavy apps keep growing. Closing Thoughts While Cardano, Dogecoin, and Solana have all secured their spot among the top performing cryptos, none provide the same crypto presale upside and built-in demand cycle as Cold Wallet. With a live product, active users, and a pricing gap that is difficult to overlook, CWT offers early buyers something uncommon in crypto: real space for large ROI. If you are aiming to place yourself for possible 100x returns before wider attention arrives, Cold Wallet could be the one you regret passing up.

2025-08-05 18:00:07,49594359,1754416807,Bitcoin Spot Market Dries Up: Relentless Buying Off Exchanges Powers Growth,"Bitcoin is trading at a pivotal level after losing key support zones, triggering concerns among investors about a potential deeper correction. After spending over two weeks consolidating in a tight range, BTC broke down sharply, reaching lows around $112,000. This sudden drop has shaken market sentiment, with some analysts warning of further downside if demand fails to absorb the recent selling pressure. However, not all indicators are flashing red. Top analyst Axel Adler shared compelling data revealing that, starting from the end of February 2024, the average Exchange Netflow on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has been predominantly negative. In fact, Netflows were positive on only two occasions since then, indicating that demand has consistently outpaced supply during this period. This sustained outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges signals strong accumulation trends, as investors continue to withdraw BTC for long-term holding rather than selling into the market. While the current price action has sparked fear of a bearish reversal, the underlying demand dynamics suggest that the broader uptrend may still be intact. Whether Bitcoin can defend the $112K support zone and recover in the coming sessions will be crucial in determining the next phase of its market cycle. Supply Shortage Deepens As Bitcoin Accumulation Persists According to analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s supply dynamics continue to paint a bullish long-term picture despite recent price volatility. Adler highlights that coins have been consistently bought off exchanges for nearly a year and a half, significantly reducing the available liquidity in the spot market. This persistent outflow has gradually created a supply shortage, which has been a key driver behind Bitcoin’s impressive growth over the past months. This accumulation trend remains active, with investors — particularly long-term holders and institutional players — continuing to withdraw BTC from exchanges at a steady pace. As liquidity dries up, even moderate demand can trigger outsized price moves, which has fueled much of Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. However, Adler also points out a growing challenge: as Bitcoin approaches historically overvalued levels, selling pressure is beginning to surface. Short-term holders and profit-takers are becoming more active, especially as BTC tests key psychological price levels. This friction between dwindling supply and increasing profit-taking behavior could lead to heightened volatility in the coming weeks. If accumulation continues to outpace supply inflows, the broader uptrend could remain intact. Yet, the overvaluation signals suggest a period of consolidation or corrective moves is necessary to reset market conditions before Bitcoin attempts another push toward new highs. Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $114,937 after facing a sharp correction from its recent all-time high of $123,000. The daily chart shows that BTC lost the critical $115,724 support level, which has now turned into immediate resistance. The price is attempting to retest this level, but the rejection from the 50-day moving average around $115,100 suggests that bulls are struggling to regain momentum. The price structure reveals a clear breakdown from the tight range formed between $115K and $122K, followed by a lower high formation that indicates weakening bullish strength. Volume has been declining during this rebound attempt, signaling a lack of strong buying interest at current levels. The 100-day moving average at $108,100 serves as the next major support if BTC fails to reclaim $115K. On the upside, reclaiming the $115,724 level with strong volume would be a bullish sign, potentially triggering a move back toward the $120K-$122K resistance zone. However, failure to break above this level could confirm a bearish retest and increase the likelihood of BTC revisiting the $112K-$110K support range in the coming sessions.

2025-08-05 18:00:00,49595000,1754416800,U.S Neobank Slash Debuts Stablecoin with Stripe's Bridge for Global Business Payments,"Slash, a San Francisco-based neobank for businesses, launched a payments and treasury platform powered by a new U.S. dollar stablecoin issued by Stripe's Bridge on Tuesday. The product, called the Global USD Account, is aimed at companies seeking U.S. dollar access and cross-border payments without a U.S. bank account. It introduces Slash’s own stablecoin, USDSL, which lets users store, send and receive dollars or stablecoins in one account, the company announced. The setup aims to shorten settlement times and remove foreign exchange fees for cross-border payments to U.S. suppliers, the company said in an interview with CoinDesk. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrencies pegged to external assets like the U.S. dollar, have grown into a $250 billion market, often touted as a faster, cheaper option for international payments. Interest in the sector has accelerated since U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, setting new federal standards for stablecoin issuers. Global banks and retailers including Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring stablecoin products, and payments firms like PayPal and Stripe have made significant moves in the space. Stripe acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge last year for $1.1 billion. Slash's first foray into stablecoins allowed customers to send and receive USDC (USDC) and USDT (USDT) payments on the platform without having to hold the tokens, converting them automatically to U.S. dollars. ""It's super interesting because we were very much not a crypto company,"" Cardenas said, adding that he personally didn't know much about blockchain technology. ""But then we had these wholesalers and marketing agencies telling us we need to have stablecoin payments to accept money from customers at lower cost."" ""So we shipped it for them,"" he said. Launched in December, that feature now already processes nearly $1 billion annualized volume and inspired the firm to go bigger with stablecoins, Cardenas said. The firm now targets crypto companies that want to consolidate their treasury management that previously needed separate accounts at traditional banks, exchanges and custody providers. With the new slate of products, clients can convert between stablecoins, manage balances and off-ramp to U.S. bank accounts through ACH, wire or SWIFT transfers. They can also earn yield on their balances without triggering securities rules, the company said. Future plans include launching a card that lets businesses spend their stablecoin balances and potentially a wallet for holding other crypto assets, Cardenas said. In May, Slash raised $41 million in a Series B round led by Goodwater Capital, valuing the company at $370 million.

2025-08-05 17:55:10,49594105,1754416510,Coinbase Perpetual Futures: Exciting Succinct PROVE Listing Sparks New Opportunities,"BitcoinWorld Coinbase Perpetual Futures: Exciting Succinct PROVE Listing Sparks New Opportunities The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a significant announcement! Coinbase International recently revealed an exciting development: the listing of Succinct (PROVE) perpetual futures. This move signals a substantial expansion in Coinbase’s offerings, providing traders with new avenues for engaging with the dynamic crypto market. Trading on the PROVE-PERP market is set to begin on or after 7 p.m. UTC, marking a pivotal moment for those interested in Coinbase perpetual futures . What Are Coinbase Perpetual Futures and Why Are They Important? Perpetual futures are a popular type of crypto derivative. They allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures have no expiration date, which enables continuous trading. This continuous nature, combined with the ability to use leverage, makes perpetual futures trading highly appealing to a wide range of participants. Coinbase International’s foray into this space means a reputable, regulated exchange is now offering these powerful instruments. This can bring more institutional interest and mainstream adoption to the crypto derivatives market. Deep Dive into the Succinct PROVE Listing Succinct (PROVE) is a project focused on ZK-proofs, a critical technology for scaling and privacy in blockchain networks. Its Succinct PROVE listing on a major platform like Coinbase International highlights the growing importance of infrastructure-focused tokens within the broader crypto ecosystem. The listing provides traders with a new way to gain exposure to this innovative technology. It allows speculation on the future value of PROVE, potentially attracting more liquidity and attention to the project. This is a clear indicator of Coinbase’s commitment to offering diverse and cutting-edge crypto assets for trading, expanding its Coinbase perpetual futures portfolio. Exploring Benefits and Challenges of Perpetual Futures Trading Engaging with perpetual futures offers distinct advantages, but it also comes with inherent risks. Understanding both sides is crucial for responsible trading in the perpetual futures trading landscape. Benefits: Leverage: Traders can amplify potential gains with a smaller initial capital. Liquidity: Enjoy high liquidity, allowing for easy entry and exit from positions. 24/7 Trading: Markets operate continuously, reflecting the global nature of crypto. Hedging: Use futures to offset potential losses in spot market holdings. Challenges: High Risk: Leverage can magnify losses as quickly as gains.

With $1B in daily trading volume, the payments-focused cryptocurrency is testing key resistance levels while institutional interest grows. As one of the most widely used payment cryptocurrencies, Litecoin’s fundamentals continue to strengthen even as price action turns volatile. Source: CoinGecko From Mining Apps to Mainstream Payments: Why Litecoin is 2025’s Dark Horse Litecoin is a crypto network designed for daily use. People and businesses frequently use the blockchain and its underlying asset for daily transactions and point-of-sale payments. The Litecoin network validates transactions faster, utilizing a block time of 2.5 minutes and low transaction fees, which gives it a triple combination of speed, security, and affordability. This appeal has seen Litecoin grow into a quiet powerhouse in the crypto payment sector, where it now leads as the second most-used digital asset for transactions, just right behind Bitcoin. Our July data reveals changes in crypto payment preferences: Bitcoin leads at 22.9% Litecoin climbs as 2nd to 14.5% USDC rises at 14% TRON enters top 4 at 12.9% Which cryptos will be at the top in August? pic.twitter.com/yzGdO8AwV3 — CoinGate (@CoinGatecom) August 4, 2025 The mining of $LTC has also become popular in the sector thanks to wider adoption. Some mining apps like PAXMINING and RICH Miner now give users the ability to mine Litecoin directly from their devices, making it more accessible for retail users to participate in the security of the network and earn passive rewards. Litecoin recently celebrated a major milestone, processing its 340 millionth transaction . Since the network hit 300 million on January 8, nearly 12% of all $LTC transactions have occurred in 2025.

Meanwhile, over 164,000 $LTC tokens are now held in MWEB addresses, which offer users enhanced privacy. 164k+ Litecoin in mweb addresses. Higher. pic.twitter.com/bADVSGjmdP — Litecoin (@litecoin) July 24, 2025 Several factors are also fueling bullish sentiment around Litecoin, particularly among institutional investors. For instance, California-based pharmaceutical company MEI Pharma made headlines recently when it allocated $100 million to Litecoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, a major vote of confidence in the asset’s long-term value. Additionally, speculation around a spot Litecoin ETF is gaining traction. Analysts are putting the odds of approval as high as 90% by 2025. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on Grayscale’s application until October, such procedural steps are common and not necessarily negative. Looking ahead, analysts are eyeing a price range of $160 to $170 in the short term. Can $LTC break through? Let’s consider the TA below. Litecoin Pauses After Strong Recovery, But Buyers Still Show Up Around $122 After several sessions of steady price appreciation, $LTC is experiencing a cooling-off phase near $123–$124. The 1-hour chart reveals that the pair recently climbed from below $111 to touch a local high of $127.50. However, the price has started pulling back, and a closer look at the volume footprint shows that sellers attempted to regain control around the $126–$127 area, where aggressive selling volume began to outweigh bids. Despite this, buyers are still defending the $122.50–$123.00 region with decent absorption. The volume footprint confirms strong interest during the breakout candle around 08:00 UTC, with over 800K contracts traded and a slightly negative delta, indicating that sellers were pressing but failed to halt the move. A second burst occurred around 11:00, with 1.4M in total volume but a large negative delta of -72.6K, showing that sellers overwhelmed the tape in that period. Yet, there was no dramatic follow-through afterward, implying that while the bears were active, they didn’t drive the price much lower. On the price chart, $LTC remains above its 20, 50, and 100-period SMAs, confirming that the short- to mid-term structure is still intact. The 20-SMA has begun moving upward, providing intraday support during the pullback. However, momentum has slowed. Another indicator of interest is the Relative Strength Index, otherwise known as the RSI. The RSI has fallen from overbought levels and is now around 58. This gives it some breathing space, but without instilling any form of bearish divergence. Nonetheless, we expect the broader market trend to remain as it is, unless the bears unexpectedly push $LTC below the 20-SMA line around $122.5. On the other hand, a forward and decisive nudge towards $127.50 would continue the bullish structure.

2025-08-05 17:50:08,49594487,1754416208,Indonesia’s Sovereign Fund could start accumulating Bitcoin,"Indonesia has joined the list of countries exploring Bitcoin as a national reserve. The effort is being pushed by the Vice President’s office, and the idea is being considered because of its potential to diversify national reserves, serve as a hedge against inflation, and reduce reliance on traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, especially in the face of global economic volatility. According to a post on X from Bitcoin Indonesia, the largest BTC community in the country, the Vice President’s office has expressed interest in Bitcoin and wants to know how it can support the country. BIG NEWS: 🇮🇩 Indonesia is exploring Bitcoin as a national reserve. We were invited to the Vice President’s office to present how Bitcoin could benefit the country. What we discussed could shape the future of Indonesia’s economic strategy. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/QGKgGRRgEU — Bitcoin Indonesia (@bitcoinindo21) August 5, 2025 Indonesia may consider Bitcoin mining as a national reserve strategy Members of the community were invited to the Vice President’s office to make a presentation on how Bitcoin could benefit the country, and they reportedly discussed topics that could alter the future of Indonesia’s economic strategy. While there, they announced readiness to lead Bitcoin education at the national level and proposed what they called a “bold” idea: using Bitcoin mining as a national reserve strategy with the ultimate goal of using Bitcoin to fuel long-term economic strength. “We presented @saylor’s 2045 price prediction, which happens to align with 100 years of Indonesian independence,” a tweet from the post read. “They were bullish. So were we.” Indonesia’s Sovereign Fund (Danantara) could start accumulating Bitcoin Various parties in the country of Indonesia, including the office of the VP, believe it is time for BTC to be added to the country’s national reserve. Gabriel Rey, CEO of licensed crypto exchange Triv, and Anthony Leong, Deputy Secretary General of the Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association (HIPMI), both argue that it is time for Indonesia to explore the possibility, and proposed that Bitcoin be included as one of BPI Danantara’s investment options. Leong says if BPI Danantara allocated IDR 300 trillion (about $18.3 billion) to Bitcoin, it could lock up up to 200,000 BTC. The profits generated could help reduce some of the national debt if the digital asset’s price increases significantly. The Daya Anagata Nusantara Investment Management Agency (BPI Danantara) was officially launched by the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto, on February 24, 2025, and is tasked with managing state assets independently to accelerate long-term development. The purpose of the Bitcoin reserve would be to diversify state assets, protect national wealth from inflation, and keep up with the trend of developed countries that are starting to include crypto assets in their portfolios. The proposal triggered support and opposition across various circles, and among those that spoke up was Indonesia’s financial regulator, Financial Services Authority (OJK). OJK was cautious in its response, expressing a willingness to entertain the discourse further, while emphasizing the need for strong regulations and governance if it were to happen. If the discourse becomes a reality, it could make Indonesia one of the first countries in Southeast Asia to adopt Bitcoin as part of its sovereign wealth fund.

The plan envisions Brazil's Central Bank purchasing Bitcoin over time, increasing its share of the cryptocurrency to 5% of the country's foreign exchange reserves. The bill cites examples of steps taken by countries like the United States and El Salvador to integrate cryptocurrencies into their national financial management strategies. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces It Will List Its Third Altcoin in a Row The proposed law requires that purchased Bitcoin be stored in cold storage and that all transactions be publicly reported. However, the bill does not specify a timeline for when or under what circumstances Bitcoin holdings could be sold. The US recently took a similar step, but stated that BTC could only be purchased without creating an additional burden on taxpayers. This generally means a reserve will be established from confiscated Bitcoin. The US reserve, on the other hand, also pledges not to sell BTC. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-05 17:46:11,49593765,1754415971,"Solana, Cardano, and Ozak AI Price Predictions: Can These Cryptos Deliver 10x Gains by 2025?","Crypto traders are looking for initiatives that could realistically deliver 10x returns—or extra—by way of 2025. Among the pinnacle contenders are Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), two properly set up altcoins with sturdy ecosystems. But there’s also a growing potential project in the AI-crypto region—Ozak AI ($OZ)—presently in its presale stage, yet already gaining main traction for its innovation and upside potential. Let’s break down what each of these projects gives and which one really has the capability to turn modest investments into life-changing profits. Solana (SOL) Solana has made a remarkable comeback due to the fact it dipped in 2022. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low prices, Solana has positioned itself as a high-performance alternative to Ethereum. The network has seen an explosive boom in NFT projects, DeFi apps, and memecoin trading. With a current price hovering around $164, many analysts consider SOL may want to revisit or maybe surpass its preceding all-time excessive close to $260. A 10x gain from right here would place SOL at around $1,600, which, while not impossible, could require large institutional capital and broader crypto market growth. While Solana has strong fundamentals, it may not offer the kind of early-stage upside that smaller-cap tokens like Ozak AI can. Cardano (ADA) Cardano has long been known for its scientific approach to blockchain development. With peer-reviewed protocols and steady upgrades through the Hydra and Basho phases, ADA is aiming to become one of the most scalable and interoperable blockchains in the space. Currently priced around $0.72, a 10x from here would bring ADA to $7.20, close to its long-term price projections. Many Cardano holders are bullish on its ability to attract more dApps and DeFi protocols as the ecosystem matures. However, Cardano’s slow development pace has often frustrated investors, and in a bull market where speed and hype matter, ADA could underperform compared to more agile projects. Ozak AI ($OZ) Ozak AI —a newcomer that’s quickly establishing itself as one of the hottest presale tokens of 2025. With the world turning toward AI-driven tools and automation, Ozak AI blends crypto and artificial intelligence in a way that’s directly usable by traders and analysts. Currently in its 4th Ozak AI presale stage at just $0.005 per token, Ozak AI has already raised over $1.5 million and sold more than 65 million tokens. The platform offers: Exclusive AI Agents for predictive market analysis Real-Time Analytics through the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) Performance-Based Rewards for using high-accuracy models The utility is clear, the tokenomics are strong (only 10% unlock at TGE, followed by a 6-month vesting), and upcoming listings are confirmed on both a top centralized exchange and a leading DEX post-TGE. A move from $0.005 to just $0.50 would be a 100x gain—and even a smaller post-launch rally to $0.05 would offer 10x upside, far more than what’s expected from SOL or ADA in the same time frame. So, which one will 10x by 2025? Let’s compare: Solana: Solid fundamentals, could 2x–4x realistically, but 10x requires extreme market conditions. Cardano: Has potential for 5x–8x with ecosystem growth, but still facing headwinds due to slow execution. Ozak AI: Low market cap, huge hype, and real AI use cases—easily has the clearest path to 10x and beyond, especially if it gains traction post-listing. Solana and Cardano remain strong long-term plays for those seeking relatively stable growth in the altcoin space. But if you're hunting for true early-stage moonshot potential, Ozak AI could be the token to watch. With its AI-powered tools, growing presale success, and aggressive listing roadmap, $OZ might just be the breakout crypto that defines the 2025 bull run. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

2025-08-05 17:43:34,49594381,1754415814,Jito Labs proposes full revenue control for DAO in JIP-24 governance proposal,"In a bold step toward deepening decentralisation and empowering token holders, Jito Labs has introduced a governance proposal, JIP-24 , that seeks to reroute all protocol-generated fees directly to the Jito DAO treasury. The initiative has generated significant buzz across the Solana ecosystem, as it signals a potential shift in how value is captured and redistributed within one of the network’s largest DeFi protocols. If approved, the proposal will not only eliminate Jito Labs’ share of fees but will also grant the DAO full control over revenue management. This could have long-term implications for the JTO token value and the financial sovereignty of the community. Jito DAO to receive 100% of fee revenue At the heart of the JIP-24 proposal is a restructuring of how protocol fees are distributed. Currently, 6% of the rewards from Jito’s Block Engine, an infrastructure component responsible for extracting and routing MEV (maximal extractable value), is split evenly between Jito Labs and the DAO. However, under JIP-24, this fee split will be scrapped entirely. Instead, the full 6% will flow directly into the Jito DAO treasury. Moreover, all future revenue generated by the recently launched Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) will also be directed to the same treasury address. This transition is aimed at ensuring that all economic value created within the Jito ecosystem accrues to the DAO and, by extension, to JTO token holders. It also reflects a growing trend across decentralised finance, where protocols are increasingly shifting fee ownership to community-led entities. The launch of BAM transaction sequencing layer Notably, the JIP-24 proposal arrives alongside the launch of BAM, a new transaction sequencing layer that brings verifiability, programmability, and privacy to Solana’s blockspace economy. BAM introduces “plugins” that allow developers to embed custom logic into block building, opening up new monetisation channels for the network. Revenue from these plugins is expected to be substantial. Officials estimate that, when combined with existing Block Engine fees, the DAO could generate up to $15 million annually in recurring revenue. With the adoption of BAM still in its early stages, that figure could grow over time. This potential windfall places the DAO in a stronger financial position and could enhance its ability to fund initiatives that drive long-term protocol value. Jito DAO treasury to be steered by Cryptoeconomics SubDAO JIP-24 also defines a strategic roadmap for deploying the incoming funds. Revenue will be managed by the Cryptoeconomics SubDAO (CSD), an autonomous governance body established under a previous proposal, JIP-17. The CSD is tasked with designing and executing token value-accrual strategies. These may include buybacks, staking incentives, fee-switch mechanisms, and grants aimed at ecosystem expansion. Its mandate is both technical and economic, aiming to align capital deployment with the long-term interests of the network. With a sub-treasury already funded with $7.5 million in JitoSOL and 5 million JTO tokens, the CSD is positioned to begin deploying programs within the next two quarters. Transparency measures, including updated dashboards and annual reporting, will ensure that all fund usage is publicly accountable. Potential risks While the benefits of JIP-24 are clear, the proposal also acknowledges potential risks. The reconfiguration of fee routing involves technical steps such as Revenue Routing Transactions (RRTs) and updates to on-chain addresses. Delays in these processes could slow implementation. Additionally, managing multiple revenue streams introduces accounting complexity. However, the DAO plans to address this through robust financial reporting and monitoring tools, aiming to maintain transparency and efficiency. Despite these challenges, early sentiment within the Jito community appears strongly supportive. With the DAO poised to become the sole recipient of all protocol revenues, many see JIP-24 as a defining moment in the network’s journey toward full decentralisation. Implications for JTO token holders For crypto traders and investors, the passage of JIP-24 could have meaningful implications for the value of JTO. By centralising all revenue within the DAO and empowering tokenholder-driven governance, the proposal enhances the economic case for holding JTO. As capital flows increase and strategic programs roll out, demand-side pressure on the token could rise. This may be especially impactful in a market where protocol value capture increasingly drives token valuations.

2025-08-05 17:41:37,49593641,1754415697,"Altcoin Season Debate Heats Up as DOGE Liquidity, SHIB Whales, ADA Institutions Align","Talk of an altcoin season is intensifying as traders search for signs beyond Bitcoin. With the Altcoin Season Index holding below 40, the market is not yet in full rotation. Still, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Cardano are showing that selective flows can define this stage of the cycle. Shiba Inu: Ecosystem Resilience in a Cooling Market The Shiba Inu price stands at $0.000012 , with a market cap of about $7 billion and daily volume near $210 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Unlike earlier cycles, SHIB’s relevance is no longer tied only to social energy. Shibarium, its Layer‑2 network, continues to settle DeFi transactions and NFT activity, while DAO proposals seek to broaden governance participation. Although SHIB is down roughly 8% over the past week, its on‑chain participation suggests a more sustainable footing than prior meme cycles. Whale wallet growth of over 600% in recent weeks supports the idea that longer‑term holders are active. Dogecoin: Liquidity Anchor for Risk Appetite The Dogecoin price trades around $0.20, giving it a $30 billion market cap and $1.7 billion in daily turnover. DOGE has eased about 5% from late‑July highs but remains one of the most liquid altcoins. DOGE Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) For traders, DOGE functions as a liquidity anchor when speculative appetite rises. Analysts forecast near‑term resistance around $0.215 and possible extension toward $0.30 if risk flows deepen. Its ongoing retail base and integration into payment platforms make it unique among meme coins in sustaining consistent volume across cycles. DOGE’s behavior reinforces the argument that altseason need not mean new projects alone—it often revives legacy tokens that still capture liquidity quickly. Cardano: Testing Institutional Narratives The Cardano price is holding near $0.73 , with a market cap close to $26 billion and daily volume above $1 billion. Cardano’s technical roadmap remains active. Hydra scaling and Mithril sync upgrades are operational, while Voltaire governance steps continue. But what sets ADA apart in this phase is its appeal to institutional and regulatory‑focused investors. Stablecoins such as USDA and Djed are expanding on‑chain liquidity, and Total Value Locked has reached around $470 million. Analysts argue that these developments could give ADA an edge if broader inflows return later in 2025, even as short‑term sentiment remains soft. A Selective Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index ’s current level indicates that Bitcoin is still outperforming most altcoins. Yet SHIB, DOGE, and ADA show that rotation does not have to be broad to matter. Each token demonstrates a different path: community sustainability, liquidity resilience, and institutional alignment. Rather than a sweeping altseason, this period looks defined by selective positioning into tokens with clear liquidity or utility anchors. Traders appear willing to allocate where there is structure and participation, even while mid‑caps remain muted. Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Cardano together reflect the layered nature of this altcoin season debate. SHIB leans on ecosystem sustainability, DOGE continues to anchor speculative liquidity, and ADA appeals to regulatory‑aligned growth narratives. Whether this expands into a full altseason remains uncertain, but these tokens are already shaping how traders view capital rotation in mid‑2025.

2025-08-05 17:39:09,49594482,1754415549,"Cardano Founder Hints at Midnight Airdrop Launch, Sparks Fresh Excitement","Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson has once again stirred the crypto world with a cryptic message. His recent post on X hinted at a new phase in the long-awaited Midnight airdrop project. Many believe the claim portal for Midnight’s native token NIGHT could open on August 5, ahead of its official announcement. This has triggered fresh excitement among Cardano, XRP, and Bitcoin holders, who stand to gain the most from the upcoming distribution. Hoskinson’s Hint Fuels Midnight Airdrop Speculation Although there has been no direct confirmation, Hoskinson’s brief post quickly caught attention across the crypto space. The post has led many to believe that a new stage of the airdrop process is about to begin. Many believe it points to the opening of the Midnight airdrop claim portal. Some also suspect that other updates related to the Glacier Drop snapshot may be announced soon. Charles Hoskinson had earlier said that more details would be announced during the Rare Evo conference, taking place from August 6 to 10. He also assured the community that the airdrop would still take place in the second half of 2025, as planned. Cardano Midnight Glacier Drop Sets Stage for Massive Multi-Chain Airdrop Hoskinson previously confirmed the completion of the Midnight Glacier Drop snapshot. This marks a major step toward the airdrop of both NIGHT and DUST tokens. The Midnight Foundation shared details showing that over 37 million users across eight different blockchains will be eligible to receive tokens. Holders of Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum will receive tokens based on the amount they held at the time of the snapshot. The value will be based on a fixed exchange rate. XRP holders are reportedly among those set to receive the largest share of rewards. Over 2.2 million wallets holding more than 62 billion XRP will receive 1.2 billion worth of NIGHT tokens. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) users have the highest number of wallets eligible for the airdrop. This cross-chain approach has drawn a lot of attention from many in the crypto community. It highlights the growing focus on multi-chain integration and privacy in Web3. Hoskinson Responds to Critics Early reports suggest that the NIGHT token may be worth about $0.41. If more people use and adopt the token, it could become one of the top 20 crypto assets. Many believe this project could support the growth of privacy tools in Web3 and help build stronger links between different blockchain systems . Meanwhile, some critics have accused Hoskinson of delaying Cardano’s progress. In response, he pointed to the strong interest Midnight has already received, including attention from financial institutions. Hoskinson made it clear that Midnight is a core part of Cardano’s future. He emphasized that both projects share a long-term vision and will grow together. This initiative is part of Hoskinson’s broader plan to make Cardano more competitive in the blockchain industry .

2025-08-05 17:30:11,49593212,1754415011,Groundbreaking OpenAI AI Models Unveiled: A Leap for Open Source AI,"BitcoinWorld Groundbreaking OpenAI AI Models Unveiled: A Leap for Open Source AI In a significant move that’s capturing the attention of tech enthusiasts and innovators alike, OpenAI has just announced the release of two new ‘open’ AI reasoning models. For those closely following the rapid advancements in AI and its potential impact on various sectors, including the burgeoning blockchain and cryptocurrency space, this development signals a fascinating shift in strategy. These new OpenAI AI models are designed to be freely accessible, potentially democratizing advanced AI capabilities and fostering collaborative AI development . What Are These New OpenAI AI Models and Why Are They Important? OpenAI, a company often associated with its powerful proprietary systems, made a notable announcement on Tuesday: the launch of two open-weight AI reasoning models . These models are comparable in capability to their ‘o-series’ counterparts but come with a crucial difference – they are freely available for download on Hugging Face, a popular online platform for developers. Here’s a quick look at what makes these models stand out: State-of-the-Art Performance: OpenAI describes these models as ‘state-of-the-art’ when measured against several benchmarks for comparing other open models. Two Sizes for Versatility: The larger, more capable GPT-OSS-120b model can operate on a single Nvidia GPU. The lighter-weight GPT-OSS-20b model is designed to run efficiently on a consumer laptop with just 16GB of memory. First ‘Open’ Model Since GPT-2: This release marks OpenAI’s first ‘open’ language model in over five years, signaling a potential shift back towards a more collaborative approach after years of focusing on proprietary, closed-source development. These models are designed to be highly versatile. They can even send complex queries to more powerful cloud-based AI models, meaning developers can connect an open model to OpenAI’s more capable closed models if a specific task, like image processing, is beyond the open model’s current scope. Why the Shift Towards Open Source AI? OpenAI’s history has seen it move from an early open-source advocate to a largely proprietary model. This shift helped them build a substantial business by selling API access to their advanced AI models. However, the landscape is changing, and this new release suggests a strategic pivot. Several factors appear to be driving OpenAI’s renewed interest in open source AI : CEO Sam Altman’s Perspective: Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, stated in January that he believes the company has been ‘on the wrong side of history’ regarding open-sourcing its technologies. This sentiment likely reflects a re-evaluation of their long-term strategy. Rising Competition: Chinese AI labs, including DeepSeek, Alibaba’s Qwen, and Moonshot AI, have rapidly gained prominence by developing highly capable and popular open models. While Meta’s Llama models once dominated this space, they have recently fallen behind. This competition is pushing OpenAI to re-engage with the open-source community. Political Pressure: The Trump Administration has also urged U.S. AI developers to open source more technology. The goal is to promote the global adoption of AI that aligns with American values, a geopolitical angle that cannot be overlooked in the high-stakes world of AI. By releasing GPT-OSS , OpenAI aims to foster goodwill with both developers and policymakers, addressing concerns about the dominance of non-U.S. entities in the open-source AI arena. As Sam Altman stated, ‘OpenAI’s mission is to ensure AGI that benefits all of humanity. To that end, we are excited for the world to be building on an open AI stack created in the United States, based on democratic values, available for free to all and for wide benefit.’ How Do These AI Reasoning Models Perform in Practice? OpenAI has set high expectations for its new open models, aiming for them to lead among other open-weight AI reasoning models . Here’s how they stacked up on some key benchmarks: Competitive Coding Test (Codeforces with tools): GPT-OSS-120b: Scored 2622 GPT-OSS-20b: Scored 2516 Both models outperformed DeepSeek’s R1 but underperformed OpenAI’s own o3 and o4-mini models. General Knowledge Test (Humanity’s Last Exam with tools): GPT-OSS-120b: Scored 19% GPT-OSS-20b: Scored 17.3% Again, these models underperformed o3 but surpassed leading open models from DeepSeek and Qwen. A Note on Hallucinations: It’s important to acknowledge that OpenAI’s new open models exhibit significantly higher hallucination rates compared to their latest proprietary models (o3 and o4-mini). For instance, on PersonQA, OpenAI’s in-house benchmark for knowledge accuracy about people: GPT-OSS-120b: Hallucinated in response to 49% of questions. GPT-OSS-20b: Hallucinated in response to 53% of questions. This is more than triple the hallucination rate of OpenAI’s o1 model (16%) and higher than o4-mini (36%). OpenAI explains this is ‘expected, as smaller models have less world knowledge than larger frontier models and tend to hallucinate more.’ Unpacking the Training Behind GPT-OSS and Future AI Development The training processes for these new GPT-OSS models share similarities with OpenAI’s proprietary models, incorporating advanced techniques to enhance efficiency and capability. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): Both models leverage MoE architecture, meaning they activate fewer parameters for any given question, which boosts efficiency. For example, the GPT-OSS-120b model, with 117 billion total parameters, only activates 5.1 billion parameters per token. High-Compute Reinforcement Learning (RL): The models were trained using high-compute RL, a post-training process that teaches AI models ‘right from wrong’ in simulated environments, often utilizing large clusters of Nvidia GPUs. This technique was also used for OpenAI’s o-series, giving the open models a similar ‘chain-of-thought’ process where they take additional time and computational resources to work through answers. AI Agent Capabilities: As a result of this post-training, OpenAI’s open models excel at powering AI agents, capable of calling tools like web search or Python code execution as part of their reasoning process. Text-Only Focus: It’s worth noting that these open models are currently text-only. They cannot process or generate images and audio, unlike some of OpenAI’s other models. Licensing and Safety Considerations in AI Development OpenAI is releasing GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b under the Apache 2.0 license, one of the most permissive open-source licenses available. This allows enterprises to monetize these OpenAI AI models without needing to pay or seek permission from the company. However, unlike some fully open-source offerings, OpenAI will not be releasing the training data used to create these models. This decision is understandable given ongoing lawsuits against AI model providers regarding the use of copyrighted works in training data. Safety has also been a significant concern, leading to delays in the release. OpenAI conducted thorough investigations, including third-party evaluations, into whether bad actors could fine-tune GPT-OSS models for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks or creating biological/chemical weapons. While they found a marginal increase in biological capabilities, they concluded that these models would not reach a ‘high capability’ threshold for danger in these domains, even after fine-tuning. What’s Next for Open Source AI Development? The release of GPT-OSS marks a significant moment for open source AI , but the competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Developers are eagerly anticipating the release of DeepSeek R2, its next AI reasoning model, and a new open model from Meta’s superintelligence lab. This dynamic environment suggests a future where open-source contributions will play an increasingly vital role in shaping the trajectory of artificial intelligence. A New Era of Collaborative AI OpenAI’s decision to re-engage with the open-source community through these new OpenAI AI models is a powerful statement. It acknowledges the growing importance of collaboration, competition, and ethical considerations in the rapidly advancing field of AI. By making these advanced AI reasoning models freely available, OpenAI is not only fostering broader innovation but also attempting to steer the future of AI development towards more transparent and globally beneficial outcomes. This move could redefine the pace and direction of AI progress, making sophisticated tools accessible to a wider range of developers and researchers worldwide.

Some of the top coins of this cycle’s strategic speculation are Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and XRP. Mutuum Finance recently sold out presale phase 5. Phase 6 has only begun, with the token priced at $0.035. Phase 7 of the MUTM presale will receive a 14.29% increase to $0.04. Those buying into it at this price will realize a 71.43% return on investment when the token is listed at $0.06. MUTM presale has raised over $14 million in funding and onboarded over 14,800 token holders to date. With XRP’s legal milestones and other altcoins competing for space in crypto, Mutuum Finance is standing out with its lending model and disruptive vision for decentralized credit markets. XRP Outlook: Testing Near-Term Support Near $2.86 XRP is trading at $2.86, just above a key support area around $2.80–$2.95. XRP has fallen close to 12% from mid‑July peaks of $3.66 in the last week. Analysts are observing that if the support at $2.95 holds, the asset will rebound towards $3.20–$3.50. But failure to defend that level can lead to further correction towards $2.65. Though technically exposed, XRP’s network adoption and regulatory clarity keep it on the radar, but investor attention is also increasingly turning to newer utility‑based coins such as Mutuum Finance. Presale Phase 6 Launches for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance presale is picking up steam. It has more than 14,800 investors who have collectively invested more than $14 million. The project is at presale stage 6 at a price of $0.035. Investing at this time will give the investors a Return on Investment of 71.43%. Mutuum Finance is taking the crypto space by storm, not by hype but by utility and scale security, with its innovative dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin.

He notes that the $4,100 level remains the key barrier that Ethereum must break to reach new all-time highs. Several days ago, van de Poppe predicted a fairly normal correction until ETH touches $4,100. When ETH did not dip deeper, he shifted to expecting an upward move instead. At the moment, Ethereum’s price is hovering around $3,600. It looks like there isn’t much buying interest, and the price keeps hitting a wall below $4,100. The rally is stalling, with some people selling to lock in their profits.

He pointed out that hundreds of millions of users on ETH, Arbitrum, BSC, Solana, Polygon, TON, Avalanche, and Tron used USDT daily. Ardoino asserted that the Tether digital dollar (USDt) protected families in emerging economies against local inflation and national currency devaluation. He added that blockchains focusing on “lower gas fees” paid in USDT would “take over the world.” However, Ardoino explained that Tether was not looking to go public, even after expanding in the U.S. He said the company will remain focused on emerging markets where it had an advantage over its rivals. The Tether boss boasted that his company had done “incredibly well” in emerging markets for over a decade. He said Tether had better technology and understanding of this market segment “than anyone else.” Ardoino disclosed that his company would provide an efficient stablecoin for interbank settlements, payments, and trading as part of its “U.S. domestic strategy.” Tether will also focus on U.S. institutional markets after the landmark Genius Act crypto legislation was passed. Ardoino claimed that Tether had about $162B worth of USDT in circulation, an increase of 18% since the beginning of 2025.

He previously claimed that over 400 million people across the globe used USDT. The use of USDT also increased quarterly by 35 million wallets. The U.S. Treasury Department’s statistics showed that Tether held over $127 billion in U.S. treasuries as of the second quarter of 2025. The holdings compared it to sovereign nations like Germany, South Korea, and the UAE. Bernstein analysts expect USDT to continue dominating with a 65% share of the stablecoins market. They also claimed that stablecoins would soon evolve from the “money rail of crypto markets” to the “money rail of the internet.” The analysts believe the stablecoin market cap will grow 16x to over $4 trillion in the next ten years, up from the current $249 billion. They said this “transformative growth” would be driven by the extensive use of crypto in payments through stablecoin-native financial services and tokenized capital markets. According to the GasFeesNow platform, sending USDt on Ethereum costs $0.5619, $0.0021 on BNB, $0.0002 in Polygon, and $3.94 to $8.01 on Tron. It also costs $0.0427 to send USDT on Ton, $0.001 to $0.1 on Solana, $0.0001 on Aptos, $0.0006 on Avalanche, and $0.0062 on Polkadot. However, the platform disclosed that estimating gas fees for the Tron network was a bit tricky. Tether plans to launch a new stablecoin Ardoino said in early April that Tether was considering developing a new stablecoin that would comply with pending U.S. stablecoin laws. He pointed out that his company had no problem with the USDT being banned in the U.S. due to regulatory restrictions. The Tether CEO claimed that a new stablecoin would help circumvent the ongoing regulatory issues. However, Ardoino clarified that his company had “the highest level of compliance” regarding cooperation with regulators. He stated that the theories and rumors about Tether staying out of the U.S. market due to regulatory issues were just competitor desperation. The Tether boss said his company did not have any issues with the pending stablecoin legislation in the United States. “We believe that our main stablecoin is perfected for emerging markets, but we can craft a payment stablecoin that works for the U.S….We need to have two products with two different value propositions.” – Paolo Ardoino , CEO of Tether The Tether CEO was optimistic that the USDT would remain listed on secondary markets in the U.S. He pointed out that global access to USDT was critical for remittances. However, Ardoino also mentioned picturing a “long-term future reality” where the USDT was not “a major player” in Europe or the U.S. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-08-05 17:26:48,49593073,1754414808,XRP Hype Soars: 86% Bet on ETF Approval as Ripple Goes All-In for U.S. Bank Status,"Polymarket Bets 86% on Spot XRP ETF Approval Polymarket, a top crypto prediction platform, now pegs the odds of SEC approval for a spot XRP ETF at 86%. What explains this high confidence level? 1. Legal Clarity Surrounding Ripple In March 2025, the SEC formally dropped its longstanding lawsuit against Ripple, removing a major overhang for ETF issuers. This legal resolution reduced regulatory uncertainty and significantly bolstered confidence in XRP-based investment vehicles. 2. Growing Number of Institutional Filings Leading asset managers, including Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, CoinShares, ProShares, and more, have all submitted spot XRP ETF proposals to the SEC. The sheer volume and caliber of these filings suggest sustained institutional conviction in XRP’s long-term viability. 3. Futures ETFs Demonstrate Market Maturity CME Group launched XRP futures ETFs in mid-May this year, drawing more than $542 million in the first month More recently, ProShares introduced the Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP), a leveraged product on NYSE Arca, which surged on debut and re‑energized the narrative for spot approval. These developments signal demand and infrastructure maturity that regulators often seek. 4. Policy Developments and Framework Shifts Regulatory momentum has also shifted in favor of crypto ETFs. New legislation, such as the GENIUS Act and SEC commentary from commissioners, especially Hester Peirce, suggest an evolving framework that reduces operational complexity for altcoin ETF issuers through in‑kind creation and redemption mechanisms. 5. Market Behavior and Prediction Dynamics Polymarket’s 86% figure is underpinned by real money bets with total wagered volumes recently exceeding $114,000, reflecting serious investor conviction. Historically, Polymarket’s prediction accuracy has exceeded 90% in betting markets shortly before resolution dates. The high odds also reflect growing sentiment that the SEC will complete the approval process before the December 31, 2025 resolution deadline. Market implications An 86% approval probability indicates widespread optimism. If a spot XRP ETF is approved: Institutional capital may flow into XRP as showcased by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which saw tens of billions in inflows post‑approval. Liquidity and accessibility are set to improve because retail investors will gain regulated exposure to XRP via traditional brokerage accounts, without managing crypto wallets. Price upside could be significant with some analysts anticipating XRP might rise toward the $20–$27 zone, driven by ETF approval momentum, though volatility remains high. Ripple Officially Files Bank Charter Application with OCC Ripple Labs has formally submitted its application to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) seeking to establish Ripple National Trust Bank, a limited-purpose national trust bank fully owned by the company. Consequently, Ripple has made Volume 1 of its interagency charter application publicly available, offering stakeholders an initial window into the entity’s proposed structure and intended operations. This first volume outlines foundational details, such as the proposed headquarters in New York City, contact information, and a public notice announcing the filing. Volume 1 makes clear that Ripple is pursuing a national trust bank charter , which would empower the entity to undertake fiduciary duties, stablecoin reserve management, and institutional custody services, rather than traditional deposit-taking or consumer lending activities. Strategic Goals & Broader Context Ripple aims to secure a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would allow it to directly settle payments, hold reserves for its stablecoin RLUSD at the Federal Reserve, and bypass traditional intermediary banks, resulting in faster, more cost-effective settlement systems. Reactions & Implications The American Bankers Association and other banking groups, including the Independent Community Bankers of America, have formally opposed Ripple’s charter bid, citing concerns that a crypto-affiliated trust bank might erode consumer protections and destabilize traditional banking structures. However, industry observers note that under Comptroller Rodney Hood, the OCC has adopted a more crypto-friendly posture, rescinding prior restrictive guidance and historically rarely denying new charter applications. As majors like Circle and BitGo pursue similar charters, Ripple’s bid puts it at the forefront of a broader effort by crypto firms to bridge into regulated finance. Conclusion With Volume 1 public and the charter filing formalized, Ripple is set to redefine how stablecoins operate under U.S. federal oversight, turning ambition into architecture and innovation into institutional integration. Meanwhile, Polymarket’s 86% approval probability for a spot XRP ETF reflects a convergence of legal progress, institutional filings, market infrastructure maturity, and evolving regulatory sentiment. Therefore, this probability underscores a broad expectation that a US-based spot XRP ETF is increasingly viewed not as a question of if, but when.",News|Ripple,EN,1,polymarket bet spot xrp etf approval polymarket top crypto prediction platform peg odds sec approval spot xrp etf explains high confidence level legal clarity surrounding ripple march sec formally dropped longstanding lawsuit ripple removing major overhang etf issuer legal resolution reduced regulatory uncertainty significantly bolstered confidence investment vehicle growing number institutional filing leading asset manager including bitwise grayscale franklin templeton coinshares proshares submitted spot xrp etf proposal sec sheer volume caliber filing suggest sustained institutional conviction xrp viability future etf demonstrate market maturity cme group launched xrp future etf year drawing million first month recently proshares introduced ultra xrp etf uxrp leveraged product nyse arca surged debut narrative spot approval development signal demand infrastructure maturity regulator often seek policy development framework shift regulatory momentum also shifted favor crypto etf new legislation genius act sec commentary commissioner especially hester peirce suggest evolving framework reduces operational complexity altcoin etf issuer creation redemption mechanism market behavior prediction dynamic polymarket figure underpinned real money bet total wagered volume recently exceeding reflecting serious investor conviction historically polymarket prediction accuracy exceeded betting market shortly resolution date high odds also reflect growing sentiment sec complete approval process december resolution deadline market implication approval probability indicates widespread optimism spot xrp etf approved institutional capital may flow xrp showcased bitcoin ethereum etf saw ten billion inflow liquidity accessibility set improve retail investor gain regulated exposure xrp via traditional brokerage account without managing crypto wallet price upside could significant analyst anticipating xrp might rise toward zone driven etf approval momentum though volatility remains high ripple officially file bank charter application occ ripple lab formally submitted application office comptroller currency occ seeking establish ripple national trust bank national trust bank fully owned company consequently ripple made volume interagency charter application publicly available offering stakeholder initial window entity proposed structure intended operation first volume outline foundational detail proposed headquarters new york city contact information public notice announcing filing volume make clear ripple pursuing national trust bank charter would empower entity undertake fiduciary duty stablecoin reserve management institutional custody service rather traditional consumer lending activity strategic goal broader context ripple aim secure federal reserve master account would allow directly settle payment hold reserve stablecoin rlusd federal reserve bypass traditional intermediary bank resulting faster settlement system reaction implication american banker association banking group including independent community banker america formally opposed ripple charter bid citing concern trust bank might erode consumer protection destabilize traditional banking structure however industry observer note comptroller rodney hood occ adopted posture rescinding prior restrictive guidance historically rarely denying new charter application major like circle bitgo pursue similar charter ripple bid put forefront broader effort crypto firm bridge regulated finance conclusion volume public charter filing formalized ripple set redefine stablecoins operate federal oversight turning ambition architecture innovation institutional integration meanwhile polymarket approval probability spot xrp etf reflects convergence legal progress institutional filing market infrastructure maturity evolving regulatory sentiment therefore probability underscore broad expectation spot xrp etf increasingly viewed question,0.013,0.802,0.185,0.9979,1

June’s Yapperboard Challenge Phase 2 doled out 50,000 MNT in weekly Discord rewards, and July 8 kicked off the $1.2 million MNT Reward Booster Season 3 —locking MNT allows users to earn proportional shares of the prize pool through time-weighted snapshots. This spurred further on-chain activity, reflecting robust adoption: Q1 2025 recorded about 650,000 daily active users and over 30 million transactions, according to Mantle’s own progress review , showing a vibrant developer and user base. DeFi TVL stands at $233 million, up 2.4% in 24 hours, while bridging TVL exceeds $1.7 billion. As Mantle pushes toward its v2 roadmap with ZK proofs and expanded DA bridges, the coming months are expected to be another proving ground for this fast-moving Layer 2. Mantle Breaks Out Above $0.91, But Aggressive Sellers Return Near Session Highs $MNT has extended its upward streak on the back of sustained demand, pushing to a high of $0.9207 before retreating slightly. What’s interesting with this move is the shift in volume dynamics across the 1-hour footprint and how the price responded to it. During the early phase of the session, buy volume rose aggressively between $0.8650 and $0.8800 with supportive deltas in excess of 600K, which is indicative of committed spot and perpetual buyers lifting offers across multiple price levels. $MNT/USDT price chart, August 5 (Source: TradingView) This laid the groundwork for the impulsive move toward the $0.91 zone. However, the character changed in the final two candles. The volume footprint showed that while total traded volume exceeded 3.9 million in the last hour, delta flipped sharply negative to -1.07M. This goes beyond passive distribution; it was more of a direct selling into bids after a vertical rise. Such behavior often implies profit-taking or renewed supply entering the market, especially when it coincides with key round numbers like $0.9200. The 4-hour price chart backs up the strength of the rally, as $MNT pushed well above its 20, 50, and 100 SMAs, all now stacked in proper bullish order. The asset’s price has broken out of a falling structure and left behind a V-shaped recovery. That said, the RSI is approaching overheated territory, reading at 73.81, which historically warns of potential pause or pullback. The MACD remains supportive of trend continuation, with the lines widening and histogram building upwards, but it’s already extended. Momentum remains strong overall, but it’s worth noting the shift in effort versus result. Buyers had to expend more volume to push the price just a few cents higher toward the close. Unless fresh demand steps in above $0.9150, the risk of a local pullback grows. $MNT’s price may revisit the $0.8800–$0.8850 area again to test whether recent buyers are willing to reload. If they do, the way toward $0.94 remains open. If not, we could see today’s high as a temporary ceiling.

2025-08-05 17:25:11,49592981,1754414711,Liquid Staking: SEC’s Landmark Clarification Brings Immense Relief to DeFi,"BitcoinWorld Liquid Staking: SEC’s Landmark Clarification Brings Immense Relief to DeFi The crypto world is buzzing with significant news! The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has provided a much-anticipated clarification regarding liquid staking activities. This development, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, confirms that these activities are not considered securities under current regulations. This announcement brings immense clarity and potentially paves the way for greater innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What Exactly is Liquid Staking and Why Does This Matter? Many in the crypto community have eagerly awaited guidance on various aspects of digital assets. So, what is liquid staking , and why is the SEC’s statement so crucial? Liquid staking allows users to stake their cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) to support a blockchain network while still retaining a liquid token representing their staked assets. This liquid token can then be used in other DeFi protocols, offering flexibility and additional yield opportunities. Previously, uncertainty existed about whether these liquid staking tokens, or the activities themselves, might fall under securities laws. This ambiguity created a cloud of regulatory risk, hindering growth and participation. The SEC’s recent stance provides a welcome sigh of relief. The SEC’s Stance: A Breakthrough for Digital Asset Regulation? The U.S. SEC’s statement signifies a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation . By explicitly stating that liquid staking activities are not classified as securities, the commission offers a clearer framework. This move distinguishes liquid staking from other crypto offerings that the SEC has previously deemed securities, such as certain initial coin offerings (ICOs). This clarification suggests a more nuanced approach from the regulator, potentially indicating a willingness to understand and differentiate various blockchain-based activities. It empowers developers and users within the DeFi ecosystem to proceed with more confidence, reducing the fear of unforeseen legal challenges. This positive development could foster a new wave of innovation. Boosting DeFi Innovation and Blockchain Securities How will this clarification impact the broader landscape of DeFi innovation and the perception of blockchain securities ? The positive ripple effects are substantial across the industry. Increased Participation: More users might feel comfortable engaging in liquid staking protocols, knowing the regulatory uncertainty has lessened significantly. Enhanced Development: Developers can now build more robust and integrated DeFi applications that leverage liquid staking without the looming threat of being classified as unregistered securities. Market Confidence: This clarity could attract institutional investors who typically shy away from unregulated or ambiguous areas, potentially bringing more capital into the DeFi space. The distinction between liquid staking and traditional securities could set a precedent for future regulatory discussions concerning other decentralized protocols. This move is a crucial step towards fostering a more predictable environment for the digital asset economy. What Are the Next Steps for Crypto Enthusiasts and Developers? While this news is overwhelmingly positive, it is important to remember that the regulatory landscape is always evolving. What should crypto enthusiasts and developers consider moving forward? Stay Informed: Continue monitoring SEC statements and broader crypto regulations. Regulatory clarity can be incremental and subject to further interpretation. Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research on any liquid staking protocol or DeFi platform before participating. Understand the risks involved, including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility. Advocate for Clarity: Support initiatives that promote clear, sensible regulation for the digital asset space. This ongoing dialogue is crucial for sustainable growth and further DeFi innovation . This clarification on liquid staking is a significant step towards fostering a more predictable and innovative environment for decentralized finance. In conclusion, the U.S. SEC’s recent statement confirming that liquid staking activities are not classified as securities marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This announcement provides much-needed regulatory clarity, significantly reducing uncertainty for participants and paving the way for accelerated DeFi innovation . It reinforces the idea that not all digital asset activities fit neatly into existing regulatory boxes and encourages a more nuanced approach. As the crypto ecosystem continues to mature, such distinctions are vital for fostering growth and ensuring a robust, compliant future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is liquid staking? Liquid staking allows users to stake their cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) to secure a blockchain network while receiving a liquid token representing their staked assets. This liquid token can then be used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. 2. Why is the SEC’s clarification on liquid staking significant? The SEC’s statement confirms that liquid staking activities are not considered securities under current regulations. This provides crucial regulatory clarity, reducing uncertainty and fostering greater participation and innovation in the DeFi sector. 3. Does this mean all crypto activities are not securities? No, this clarification specifically applies to liquid staking activities. The SEC has previously deemed other crypto offerings, such as certain initial coin offerings (ICOs), as securities. Each crypto activity is assessed individually. 4. How does this impact DeFi projects? This clarity is highly beneficial for DeFi projects. It reduces regulatory risk for platforms offering liquid staking services, potentially attracting more users and institutional investment, and encouraging further development of integrated DeFi applications. 5. What should users consider before engaging in liquid staking? Users should always conduct thorough due diligence on any liquid staking protocol. Understand the specific risks involved, including smart contract vulnerabilities, potential impermanent loss, and overall market volatility, even with regulatory clarity.

A rounding bottom breakout puts $745 as key support and potential targets at $790 to $1,000. Institutional players like Nano Labs are adding BNB to treasuries, signaling rising corporate interest. Price Near Record Levels BNB changed hands at $760 at press time, with over $1 billion in 24-hour volume. Prices dipped slightly in a day and 9% over the past week. In the last 24 hours, BNB traded between $755 and $770. Its seven-day range was $735 to $833. The token is still only 12% below its record high of $858 (CoinGecko data), set on July 28, 2025. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel pointed out that BNB has outperformed most major altcoins during this market downturn. Many tokens have fallen 60–80% from their peaks, but BNB never slipped beyond 30%. That steadiness keeps it close to record levels while the broader crypto market remains shaky. $BNB is performing better than most other major coins. While many dropped by 60–80%, #BNB never fell more than 30%. Now it’s already close to its all-time high. Quietly strong and consistent. Source: CryptoQuant @cz_binance @binance pic.twitter.com/EIhlqQO4WO — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) August 4, 2025 Market data tracking the drawdown from all-time highs for top altcoins shows a clear difference. BNB, marked in blue, saw its pullbacks stay between -6% and -30%. XRP ranged from -15% to -38%, while ETH also touched -38%. SOL had the heaviest losses, dropping over 60% from its high. Interestingly, the numbers show that BNB stayed more stable than its peers. It held its ground during periods where other coins swung sharply lower, giving it a reputation for relative consistency. Chart Patterns and Future Targets Analyst Jonathan Carter identified a rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart. BNB broke above the neckline near $745 and is now retesting that level as support. Holding this zone would keep the bullish setup in place. #BNB Binance Coin is retesting the broken neckline of a rounding bottom pattern on the daily timeframe The price needs to hold above the neckline level to confirm the support and continue the bullish momentum If confirmed, we could see the price surge toward targets at… pic.twitter.com/KTrtx2T4aV — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) August 4, 2025 In case of a resumed momentum, Carter identified potential highs at $790, $850, $900, and $1,000. Volume and the RSI readings indicate that the current rally has taken a breather, and the price is consolidating upon breaking out. Ecosystem Updates and Institutional Interest Binance rolled out a web wallet that allows traders to approve transactions for up to seven days and opened bitcoin options writing to all users. Both changes are designed to support active traders and strengthen BNB’s ecosystem. Corporate interest has picked up as well.

Altcoin market shows breakout signs, but ETH may dip 10–16% before surging. Fear and Greed Index at 55 shows neutral sentiment as market nears key breakout. The altcoin market is showing strong signs of a potential breakout, and according to new analysis, the entire trend is being driven by Ethereum’s position on its long-term charts. As ETH closes in on a major “make-or-break” resistance level, traders are watching closely for what could be the start of a new altcoin season. Ethereum at a Critical Crossroads According to an analysis by Dan Gambardello, Ethereum is currently testing a long-term resistance trendline that dates all the way back to the previous bull market peak. He notes that ETH is in a classic “busted pattern,” having recovered back above a previous breakdown point to now challenge the final trendline. If Ethereum can break above this level, it could confirm a major reversal and kick off a surge toward the $4,100 mark. ALTCOINS Locked & Loaded!

2025-08-05 07:07:12,49569369,1754377632,Bitcoin's Long-Term Bullishness Evaporates From Options Market as Inflation Concern Rises,"The bitcoin (BTC) bull, once confidently gazing into the future, is reconsidering its long-term bullish conviction. That's evident from the 180-day skew, measuring the difference in implied volatility (pricing) between Deribit-listed out-of-the-money call and put options. The metric has recently retreated to zero, according to data source Amberdata, indicating that long-term market sentiment has shifted from bullish to neutral. The shift comes as some analysts warn of a bear market in 2026. A similar reset occurred at the onset of the previous bitcoin bear market, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. ""I've noticed a rather worrying sign with the recent market pullback. Bitcoin's bullish sentiment for the far-month options has vanished, and it is now firmly neutral,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""This means the options market believes it's difficult for BTC to establish a long-term uptrend, and the likelihood of new highs in the coming months is decreasing."" ""A similar situation last occurred in Jan and Feb 2022,"" he added. A put option offers insurance against price drops in the underlying asset, while a call provides an asymmetric bullish exposure. A positive skew implies a bias towards calls, indicating bullishness in the market, whereas a negative skew suggests the opposite. The neutral shift in the 180-day skew could be partly driven by structured products selling higher strike call options to generate additional yield on top of the spot market holdings. The popularity of the so-called covered call strategy could be driving the call implied volatility lower relative to puts. Macro jitters BTC fell over 4% last week, nearly testing its former record high of $11,965, as the core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose in June, while nonfarm payrolls disappointed, stoking concerns about the economy. The price drop has pushed short-term skews below zero, a sign of traders seeking downside protection through puts. According to Ardern, the inflationary effects of ""supply chain impulses"" are already showing up in economic data. ""Although falling auto prices in the last CPI report offset rising prices for other goods, one thing is undeniable: the impulse from the West Coast of the Pacific has reached the East Coast, and retailers are already trying to pass on tariffs and a host of associated costs to consumers. While wholesalers and commodity trading firms are working to smooth supply chains, price increases will still occur, albeit more moderately or ""delayed by several months,"" Ardern noted, explaining the renewed neutrality of the long-term BTC options. According to JPMorgan, President Donald Trump's tariffs are likely to elevate inflation in the second half of the year. ""Global core inflation is projected to increase to 3.4% (annualized rate) in the second half of 2025, largely due to a tariff-related U.S. spike,"" analysts at the investment bank noted, adding that cost pressures will likely be concentrated in the U.S. An uptick in inflation could make it harder for the Fed to cut rates. Trump has repeatedly criticized the central bank for keeping rates elevated at 4.25%. Traders will receive the ISM non-manufacturing PMI later Tuesday, providing insights into inflation in the service sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the U.S. economy. It will be followed by July CPI and PPI releases later this week.

2025-08-05 07:06:18,49568040,1754377578,"Machine Learning Algorithm Sets XRP Price for August 31, 2025","XRP has emerged as the top-performing cryptocurrency among the ten largest by market capitalization, currently trading at $3.05 following a 5.3% gain over the past 24 hours. This short-term recovery comes on the heels of a difficult few weeks in which the token lost the $3 support level , reflecting the ongoing volatility that continues to define the digital asset landscape. Despite the recent turbulence, investor sentiment around XRP appears resilient. Over the past month, the token has risen by almost 39%. The asset also hit a new all-time high in July , and its recent performance points to sustained interest even as broader market conditions remain cautious. However, trading volumes have retreated notably from July’s peak. Data shows that 24-hour turnover has declined, now standing at $6.27 billion. This suggests that market enthusiasm has cooled, though accumulation continues. AI Forecast Suggests Moderate Upside To estimate XRP’s potential movement through the end of the month, we’ve referenced Finbold’s machine learning framework, which is powered by multiple large language models (LLMs). These AI agents considered numerous factors, including market indicators, such as the MACD, RSI, and more. Based on this analysis, XRP is projected to reach an average price of $3.12 by August 31. This suggests a modest upside of 2.295% from its current value. While the models generally pointed to bullish continuation, there was a wide range of outcomes depending on the assumptions and indicators emphasized. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Finbold, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offered the most optimistic outlook, projecting a 15% increase amid expectations of improved liquidity and potential regulatory clarity. In contrast, GPT-4o predicted only a slight rise. While Grok 2 Vision flagged downside risks, suggesting a possible dip to $2.8, a price another analyst recently highlighted as a crucial level to watch if the asset falls. Market Outlook Hinges on Legal and Technical Factors XRP remains above its 50-day simple moving average, suggesting a constructive technical structure. However, failure to hold July highs and mixed momentum indicators have added uncertainty. The $3 level now serves as key support, with upcoming price action likely influenced by sentiment surrounding the SEC vs. Ripple case. A joint status update in the case is scheduled for August 15 and is drawing widespread attention with predictions that the lawsuit will end on that date. Though procedural, the filing may offer clues on regulatory direction. The SEC has shown a favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies, and the end of the lawsuit could help XRP outperform expectations.

In posts in his Telegram channel, pseudonymous trader Crypto Capo tells his 129,000 subscribers that BTC and altcoins could see significant dips in price in the coming weeks as risk for a black swan event remains high. According to the trader, both altcoins and BTC could see staggering price drops that see them cut in half – or more. However, according to Capo, investors appear to be gobbling up the flagship crypto asset during dips despite signs of an impending crash. “Interesting how, despite all the bearish signals, people keep buying the dip. The risk of a black swan event is still high. If it happens, we could see BTC drop to $60,000-$70,000 and altcoins crashing 50-80%. Big week ahead. Time to stay focused, volatility is coming.” Near the end of July, Capo warned investors that altcoin season has yet to begin and that a shakeout is required before it does. “If you’re wondering why your alts aren’t really going up, it’s because the altseason hasn’t started yet, and it’s likely we’ll see another big shakeout before it does… There’s a time for everything. There will be a time to get very bullish. There will be a time when altcoins pump hard for weeks. That time will come. But this isn’t it. This is a time to be bearish. Plan for the future. Act in the present.” Bitcoin is trading for $114,966 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-08-05 07:00:30,49567759,1754377230,Grayscale Welcomes Barry Silbert Back As Chairman Ahead Of US IPO,"Barry Silbert has made a notable return to Grayscale Investments, the asset management company and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, as chairman, just weeks after the crypto asset manager filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Silbert, who founded Grayscale in 2013, takes over from Mark Shifke, who will remain on the board as the company prepares for its future as a publicly traded entity. This leadership transition also coincides with Grayscale’s plans to bring in independent directors to strengthen its governance. New Executive Team At Grayscale In a significant move to bolster its executive team, Grayscale has appointed four professionals with extensive backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi). According to the firm’s announcement made on Monday, the new hires include Diana Zhang as Chief Operating Officer, Ramona Boston as Chief Marketing Officer, Andrea Williams as Chief Communications Officer, and Maxwell Rosenthal as Chief Human Resources Officer. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ These executives join Grayscale from firms such as Bridgewater, Apollo, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel, reporting directly to CEO Peter Mintzberg, who has been at the helm since last year. Mintzberg stated: This blend of institutional rigor and entrepreneurial drive shapes every aspect of how we operate at Grayscale, enabling us to deliver clients innovative investment strategies with the operating integrity they expect from a trusted partner. Silbert’s return comes at a critical juncture for the company, following a turbulent period marked by regulatory scrutiny. He stepped down as chairman in late 2023, just before the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ruling on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale’s long-standing effort to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. Around the same time, Silbert’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), faced legal challenges from New York’s attorney general regarding the collapse of crypto lending company Genesis, and its connections to crypto exchange Gemini’s Earn program, with Silbert himself named in the lawsuit. Regulatory Headwinds In his statement following the announcement, Silbert expressed his enthusiasm about rejoining Grayscale, emphasizing his belief in the company’s direction and the team leading it. Silbert noted: When I founded Grayscale in 2013, we saw an enormous opportunity to pioneer a new model for accessing and investing in digital assets, and to build the operational infrastructure that investors would ultimately demand. Today, I continue to have deep conviction in the company’s long-term positioning and in the leadership team guiding it forward.

Plan B’s model targets $250K to $1M in coming years. RSI at 72.5 signals strong momentum and ongoing bull market. Bitcoin had closed the month of July at $115,000, an $8,000 jump from June’s close which is the highest monthly close in its history. According to analyst PlanB, this record-breaking move is right in line with his models, which suggest the market is in the middle of a slow and steady bull market with a long way to go. On-Chain Data Supports BTC Bull Theory According to on-chain metrics, the market is in the middle of a slow and steady bull market. Bitcoin’s current cycle has lasted longer than previous ones, already 18 months long and yet, is still rising. While past bull markets saw explosive price moves (like 100x in 2013 and 10x in 2017), the current cycle has “only” seen a 3x rise so far.

2025-08-05 07:00:03,49567758,1754377203,Dogecoin Price Is Approaching 4HR RSI Level That Triggered Previous 70% Rally,"After an impressive run-up back in July, the Dogecoin price as suffered a slowdown, just like the rest of the market. With this, the bears seem to have reclaimed control once again, pushing Dogecoin deeper into loss territory after taking out an important position at $0.2. Nevertheless, the current decline seems to pale in comparison to the bullishness that continues to dominate among investors, with the expectations that this correction will be only temporary. Dogecoin Price Still Showing Signs Of Bullishness According to an analysis shared by crypto analyst KrissPax, the Dogecoin price may be down right now, but it is not out of the game. This is because the meme coin is currently the subject of a bullish formation as it travels down to retest a level that has previously led to a massive price surge in the past. Related Reading: Satoshimeter Shows Where Bitcoin Price Is In This Cycle The crypto analyst pointed out that the Dogecoin price is expected to fall below 30 on the 4-Hour RSI chart again, and historically, such a decline has led to a recovery. The last time that the RSI fell below 30 on the 4-Hour chart was back in June 2025, and what followed was an over 70% recovery in the next month. Using this historical performance, the Dogecoin RSI falling below 30 once again could end up registering a similar performance. The only difference this time around is that the prices are at different levels, which points to a major difference in where the highs of the uptrend will be. Last time the RSI was this low, the price was trading at the $0.14 level. This time around, the analyst explains that Dogecoin sitting at $0.2 means that there is a higher low. The good thing about the formation of higher lows is the fact that they often lead to higher highs. In the event of another 70% increase in price from here, Dogecoin could end up rallying as high as $0.34 before it loses steam. However, this would still put it at more than 50% below its all-time high of $0.74, which was hit back in 2021 and has remained the peak for the meme coin. Related Reading: Market Cap Not A Hindrance To XRP Price Reaching $1,000, Expert Explains Why As for the performance of the altcoin so far this month, after closing the month of July with a 27.1% gain, Dogecoin has already begun to give some of the gains back to the market. Data from CryptoRank shows that the cryptocurrency is already down by 5.31% this month and climbing. This is not out of the ordinary, as the month of August has historically been one of the most bearish months for the Dogecoin price. In fact, if the trend holds, then DOGE investors could be looking at an average of -10% decline this month and a close in the red.

2025-08-05 06:55:10,49567601,1754376910,Stablecoin Supply Surge: USDe & USDS See Remarkable Growth Post-GENIUS Act,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Supply Surge: USDe & USDS See Remarkable Growth Post-GENIUS Act The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing with new developments, and recent legislative changes in the United States have sparked a significant trend. We are witnessing a notable stablecoin supply surge for specific assets, particularly Ethena USDe (USDe) and Sky’s USDS. This fascinating shift is directly linked to the recent passage of the U.S. stablecoin regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act . What’s Behind the Remarkable Stablecoin Supply Surge? Following the GENIUS Act becoming law, data from platforms like DefiLlama and CoinGecko indicates a dramatic increase in the circulating supply of certain stablecoins. Specifically, the supply of USDe and USDS , which are known for offering staking rewards, has seen impressive growth. Since July 18, Ethena USDe’s circulating supply has soared by 70%, reaching approximately 9.49 billion. Similarly, Sky’s USDS has experienced a 23% increase, pushing its supply to nearly 4.81 billion. This surge highlights a clear response from the market to new regulatory frameworks. Investors are actively seeking out stablecoin options that align with their yield expectations in this evolving landscape. Decoding the GENIUS Act and Its Influence The GENIUS Act is a pivotal piece of legislation for the stablecoin sector. CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, explains a key provision: the Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly providing yields to holders. This regulation aims to bring more clarity and oversight to the stablecoin market, but it also creates a new dynamic for investors. This legislative change effectively redirects investor interest. If direct yields from issuers are no longer permitted, where do investors turn for returns on their stablecoin holdings? The answer, as the recent data shows, is towards platforms and protocols that facilitate stablecoin staking . Why Are Investors Embracing Stablecoin Staking? The appeal of staking rewards is a major driving force behind the growth of USDe and USDS . These are examples of yield-bearing stablecoins , meaning they allow holders to earn returns by participating in various decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, such as staking or liquidity provision. When traditional avenues for yield become restricted, these alternative methods gain significant traction. Investors are adapting their strategies to continue generating passive income from their stablecoin assets. This shift underscores the innovation within the crypto space, as the market finds new ways to offer value while adhering to emerging regulations. It’s a clear indication that the demand for yield in the stablecoin ecosystem remains strong. Navigating the Future of Yield-Bearing Stablecoins The ongoing stablecoin supply surge of assets like USDe and USDS illustrates a significant trend in the digital asset space. It demonstrates how regulatory developments can reshape investment behaviors and highlight specific segments of the market. As the crypto landscape matures, understanding the interplay between regulation and innovation becomes crucial. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is likely to continue as investors seek compliant ways to maximize their holdings. This trend also emphasizes the importance of robust DeFi protocols that can securely offer staking opportunities. The market is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these shifts is essential for any participant. In conclusion, the passage of the GENIUS Act has undeniably spurred a significant stablecoin supply surge for yield-offering assets like USDe and USDS . This development showcases the market’s adaptability and the persistent demand for stablecoin staking opportunities, even under new regulatory frameworks. It’s a dynamic period for stablecoins, promising continued innovation and strategic shifts for investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a U.S. stablecoin regulation bill that, among other provisions, prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly providing yields to holders. It aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for stablecoins. Why have USDe and USDS supplies surged after the GENIUS Act? The supplies of USDe and USDS have surged because, unlike traditional stablecoins under the new Act, they offer staking rewards through decentralized protocols. This makes them attractive to investors seeking yield after direct issuer-provided yields were restricted. What are yield-bearing stablecoins? Yield-bearing stablecoins are digital assets pegged to a stable value (like the U.S. dollar) that allow holders to earn returns or yield through various mechanisms, such as staking, lending, or participating in DeFi protocols. Is stablecoin staking legal under the new U.S. regulations? The GENIUS Act focuses on preventing stablecoin issuers from directly providing yield. Staking rewards typically come from decentralized protocols or other market mechanisms, which operate under different legal considerations. Investors should always research specific platforms and consult with financial advisors regarding their activities. How does this affect the broader stablecoin market? This trend suggests a shift in investor preference towards stablecoins integrated with DeFi yield opportunities. It could lead to increased innovation in yield-generating protocols and a clearer distinction between regulated issuer-backed stablecoins and decentralized yield-bearing stablecoins.

2025-08-05 06:51:40,49569367,1754376700,"Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $115K; Solana, Dogecoin Show Relative Strength as Risk-Off Sentiment Lingers","Bitcoin (BTC0 remains stuck below $115,000 after a sharp weekend drop that erased nearly $6,000 from local highs and triggered over $1 billion in liquidations across leveraged long positions. While markets have stabilized somewhat since Monday, sentiment remains fragile amid a fresh round of Donald Trump-issued tariffs and another week of choppy ETF flows. BTC traded near $114,200 in the Asian afternoon hours on Tuesday, remaining flat on the day but still below the key $115,000 – $118,000 range that had acted as short-term support over the past two weeks. Ether (ETH) fared slightly better, recovering toward $3,650 after dipping under $3,550 over the weekend, supported by sustained institutional interest and resilient flows. “Although Bitcoin has not managed to regain ground past $115,000, Ethereum has nearly recovered this week’s dip,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a note to CoinDesk. “Treasury strategies, IPOs, and the hunt for the next MicroStrategy are fueling demand. We remain positive the bull run can continue,” Ruck said. Altcoin season over? Altcoins, meanwhile, have struggled. Solana (SOL) is down nearly 20% from last week’s highs, and XRP (XRP) is flatlining near $3 despite broader market stabilization. A colloquial narrative that “altseason” is imminent has weakened, with traders rotating capital back into majors or moving to the sidelines entirely. Part of the risk-off tone stems from Friday’s U.S. jobs report, which came in weaker than expected, and a fresh round of trade tensions from Washington. The result is a broad flight to safety in global markets, with crypto caught in the crossfire. Friday also marked the second-largest outflow day for bitcoin spot ETFs, and the fourth-largest for ether, dimming hopes that institutional flows would offer short-term price support. Still, not all desks are turning bearish. QCP Capital noted in a Monday note that the broader structure remains bullish. “The recent drawdown appears more corrective than capitulatory,” the firm said in a client note. It highlighted growing activity in BTC options markets — specifically 29AUG25 call flys targeting $124,000 — as a sign that sophisticated players are positioning for a rebound. Put skew remains elevated but is not yet flashing panic. A move back above $115,000, combined with a rebound in ETF inflows and compressing implied volatility, could flip sentiment quickly, QCP said. Until then, traders are closely monitoring ETF flow data. If institutional demand stabilizes and macro jitters subside, this week’s consolidation could set the stage for a renewed push toward new highs. However, if outflows persist and risk appetite continues to fade, especially in alternative assets, markets may face another wave of de-risking before finding a true floor.

Earlier today, some users noticed a “rewards” tab briefly appearing on PumpFun's official website. However, it has since been removed from the site. This development is supported by the PUMP incentive program and volume tracking features included in the latest update to the PumpFun and PumpSwap SDKs. Users will now reportedly be able to earn rewards not only by buying and selling tokens but also by generating trading volume. Related News: Following the SEC, Another Critical Institution, CFTC, Has Launched a Bullish Initiative for Cryptocurrencies While no official announcement has been made yet, the community is expecting a major announcement from PumpFun this week.

2025-08-05 06:44:24,49568171,1754376264,From $0.035 to $2? Why some predict MUTM could outrun AVAX in 2025 bull cycle,"Being built around risk-managed lending, real-yield mechanics, and a stablecoin-based revenue loop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the lean, purpose-built protocol the next bull cycle needs. Smarter lending, leaner DeFi: what sets MUTM apart AVAX rode a wave of speculation during its early growth phase. But where it once drew attention for raw speed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now standing out for something more durable: utility with built-in value. Instead of relying on inflationary incentives or vague promises, MUTM uses real lending mechanics through a DeFi-native Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. This structure allows users to deposit stablecoins and blue-chip assets like ETH and earn passive returns via smart contracts. On the other side of the equation, borrowers will be able to lock collateral—say, AVAX or LINK—at up to 75% LTV and unlock stablecoins like USDC. That balance between capital efficiency and platform integrity is exactly what makes the system appealing to both conservative lenders and active DeFi users. For those seeking higher returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also offer Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality, where users can define their own terms for borrowing and lending. By designing a lending ecosystem that serves both sides of the market, MUTM steps into a category that’s not only sustainable but also revenue-generating—something few projects in AVAX’s early days offered. Presale momentum builds as demand rises The interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just theoretical—it’s being confirmed in the numbers. The project is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at just $0.035. More than $14 million has already been raised, and 10% of the 170 million token allocation for this phase is already committed. With a listing target of $0.06, investors entering now are positioning for immediate upside, and those projecting further growth are looking at returns well beyond that. The audit credibility further strengthens confidence. CertiK’s 95 Token Scan and 78 Skynet scores reflect a project that’s not only secure but also built with transparency in mind. On the marketing front, the $100,000 MUTM giveaway is driving rapid community engagement, with over 12,000 Twitter followers onboard. These numbers suggest not just hype, but a growing base of holders and backers before the token even hits exchanges. DeFi growth blueprint: from launch to Layer-2 dominance What’s attracting market analysts is the infrastructure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for post-launch. Upon listing on top known exchanges like Binance, KuCoin and MEXC, the platform plans to launch with a Beta version of its core dApp, giving users immediate access to lending and borrowing functions. But the real edge lies in its Layer-2 integration. This will allow for cost-efficient, high-speed transactions, removing the barriers that slowed DeFi adoption during the last cycle. One analyst, who gained a following for accurately forecasting SOL’s 2021 run, is now projecting a $2 target for MUTM in the next cycle. His rationale: a clean token model, immediate product-market fit, and a DeFi roadmap that aligns with what serious investors actually want—capital growth with real utility. A live snapshot of ROI in the making The performance trajectory for early backers is already notable. One investor who exchanged $5,000 worth of AVAX in Phase 1 for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.01 is now sitting on approximately $17,500, just based on current Phase 6 pricing. With a listing at $0.06, that same position scales to $30,000. And with projections aiming for $2, this investor stands on track for a 200x gain. In a market where large caps like BTC and ETH are showing slower growth, early-stage projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are beginning to draw capital rotation from whales seeking fresh momentum. It’s a classic cycle shift: from consolidation in majors to growth in high-upside, fundamentally sound assets. Act before the price moves With 90% of Phase 6 tokens still available but a 15% price increase set to kick in at Phase 7, the window for discounted entry is rapidly closing. Just as AVAX surprised early investors in 2021, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now emerging as the token to watch in the upcoming cycle. Smart money doesn’t wait. It moves before the breakout. As the market begins to rotate and traders hunt for the next narrative, the spotlight is moving toward protocols with real utility, revenue potential, and a clear product vision. That spotlight is now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—and it’s only getting brighter.

2025-08-05 06:44:00,49567494,1754376240,"XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Ethereum Named Among Best Altcoins to Buy Before Next Crypto Rally","XRP is once again commanding attention after a sharp move above $3 and a clean break through its $3.60 resistance level. Analysts from multiple platforms, including CoinCentral and Economic Times, point to a potential parabolic rally—possibly pushing toward the $10 range by 2027 if ETF developments and regulatory clarity materialize. Tony “The Bull” Severino even suggested a 333% surge in just 40 days, citing wave-based patterns that mirror past explosive cycles. Meanwhile, legal progress in Ripple’s long-standing battle with the SEC is restoring confidence among institutional investors. Traders are watching XRP closely, anticipating a breakout moment as liquidity begins rotating into pre-ETF plays. Ethereum’s utility keeps it dominant Ethereum continues to serve as the backbone of the blockchain economy. With new staking demand, Layer-2 rollups, and stablecoin integrations on the rise, ETH remains a core holding for both institutions and long-term believers. However, price action has been relatively conservative compared to more speculative altcoins. Analysts expect ETH to retest its previous all-time high sometime in 2026 or 2027, but few see it producing triple-digit returns in the short term. For many, Ethereum functions more like a “ crypto blue-chip ” than a high-growth asset. That said, its role as a network anchor is undisputed and continues to shape the broader DeFi and NFT infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation With Ethereum and XRP offering strong long-term prospects, many traders are also turning to smaller-cap opportunities for faster gains . One such name generating intense early momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. While ETH and XRP might require years to deliver 3x or 4x returns , MAGACOIN is being highlighted by analysts for its explosive trajectory, now projecting as much as a 1 4,900% potential ROI, given its early presale stage and viral community growth. Whale wallets have recently begun accumulating large positions, and institutional trackers show increasing mention volume across media platforms. For investors who missed the early days of Ethereum or the first XRP breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being quietly positioned as a way to access those same levels of upside – without waiting years . Timing the market’s next rotation As Bitcoin consolidates and altcoin dominance begins to rise, timing is becoming just as important as coin selection. Projects like XRP and Ethereum remain critical to any balanced portfolio—but they may not offer the high-velocity returns some traders seek in shorter cycles. This is why projects with real traction in the early-stage are drawing attention . MAGACOIN FINANCE, in particular, is benefiting from being early, visible, and well-positioned – making it a tempting option for those chasing more aggressive gains while still wanting exposure to a growing ecosystem. With market analysts now projecting as much as a 14,900% potential ROI, the timing could be favorable for those entering before major exchange listings.

2025-08-05 06:40:11,49566903,1754376011,South Korean Crypto Exchange Coinone’s Groundbreaking Digital Asset Sale,"BitcoinWorld South Korean Crypto Exchange Coinone’s Groundbreaking Digital Asset Sale In a significant development for the digital asset landscape, Coinone, a prominent South Korean crypto exchange , has announced plans for a substantial crypto sale. This move marks a pivotal moment, as Coinone becomes the first among the country’s top five exchanges to leverage new regulatory frameworks, signaling a new era of operational transparency and financial management within the cryptocurrency sector. Why is Coinone Making This Groundbreaking Coinone Crypto Sale ? Coinone’s decision to proceed with a Coinone crypto sale stems directly from the need to cover essential operating expenses. This strategic financial maneuver, valued at approximately 4.1 billion won (around $2.95 million USD) based on July 31st closing prices, is designed to ensure the smooth functioning of the exchange and maintain its robust service delivery to users. Specific Assets Involved: The sale includes a diversified portfolio of major cryptocurrencies, carefully chosen to meet their financial objectives: 10 Bitcoin (BTC) 300 Ethereum (ETH) 200,000 XRP 40,000 Cardano (ADA) Purpose of Sale: Funds generated from this digital asset sale are primarily earmarked for critical expenditures such as payroll, administrative overheads, and technology upgrades. This ensures the stability and continuity of the exchange’s operations, reinforcing its commitment to its employees and users. This proactive step highlights Coinone’s commitment to responsible financial management within the evolving cryptocurrency market. It also sets a clear example for other exchanges on how to navigate the complexities of operational costs in a highly volatile industry. Navigating the New Korean Crypto Regulations This bold step by Coinone is made possible by recent amendments in Korean crypto regulations . As of June, South Korean regulators introduced provisions allowing crypto exchanges and certain nonprofit entities to sell their proprietary crypto holdings . This regulatory shift represents a crucial acknowledgment of the operational realities faced by digital asset platforms. However, these permissions come with strict conditions, reflecting a cautious yet progressive approach to the burgeoning crypto market. The framework permits such sales only under specific, limited circumstances: Tax Obligations: Exchanges can sell assets to fulfill their tax liabilities. Operational Costs: Funds can be raised to cover essential operating costs, including employee salaries and daily administrative expenses. Default Risk Mitigation: Sales are allowed to address clear risks of default on legal obligations, ensuring financial solvency and protecting stakeholders. These regulations aim to provide exchanges with necessary liquidity for legitimate operational needs while preventing speculative or manipulative sales of their own assets, thereby safeguarding market integrity. What Does This Pivotal Digital Asset Sale Mean for the Market? Coinone’s proactive approach in initiating this digital asset sale sets a significant precedent for the entire South Korean crypto industry. Being the first among the nation’s top five exchanges to utilize this regulatory allowance, Coinone demonstrates a strong commitment to operational sustainability and compliance. This move signals a maturing market where regulatory clarity is slowly but surely emerging, fostering greater trust and stability. This development could encourage other exchanges to similarly assess their crypto holdings and leverage the new regulations for financial health. It provides a blueprint for how established platforms can manage their treasuries transparently. The market’s reaction to Coinone’s sale will be closely watched, potentially influencing future strategies for other South Korean crypto exchange platforms seeking to enhance their financial resilience. Ultimately, this sale could lead to a more stable and predictable environment for digital asset trading in South Korea, benefitting both exchanges and their users by ensuring continued, reliable service.

2025-08-05 06:34:32,49568169,1754375672,"Best 2025 altcoins: one is still $0.035, others include BNB, LINK, and BTC","With a compelling lending ecosystem, strong presale momentum, and unmatched upside, it offers a rare combination of affordability, innovation, and early-entry advantage. Lending protocol that could reshape DeFi utility What will set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart won’t just be its price—it will be the architecture of its decentralized finance (DeFi) engine. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be built to support two parallel lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), both designed to maximize returns and accessibility across all crypto users. In the P2C structure, users will be able to deposit major crypto assets such as Chainlink (LINK) or Solana (SOL) into shared liquidity pools. These lenders will earn passive income through dynamic Annual Percentage Yields (APYs), which will be adjusted automatically based on how much of the pool is being utilized. For instance, a user who deposits $10,000 in SOL with a 12% APY will earn $1,200 annually, without needing to actively manage their position. On the borrowing side, users will lock up assets like BTC or ETH and access instant, overcollateralized loans in stablecoins. With a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, $5,000 in BTC will unlock a 3,750 USDC loan, withdrawable at any time and repayable with interest calculated hourly. Meanwhile, P2P lending on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce customizable terms. It will allow users to negotiate lending conditions directly, bypassing traditional DeFi limitations. This will be especially useful for long-tail assets and tokens like DOGE, PEPE, FLOKI, and TRUMP that won’t commonly be supported by mainstream lending protocols. It will open the door for more flexible, high-reward arrangements that reflect real market conditions, not rigid algorithmic limits. This dual approach will position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as more than just another DeFi project—it will place it as a full-spectrum financial layer for crypto-native investors, whether passive or active. Phase 6 presale gains momentum as demand rises Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already showing strong traction. With over $14 million raised and more than 14,900 holders onboard, the token is gaining rapid popularity. At a current price of $0.035, it’s still trading far below its projected listing price of $0.06, giving Phase 6 buyers a clear 70% price upside before even considering secondary market appreciation. Importantly, over 10% of the allocated 170 million tokens for Phase 6 have already been sold, highlighting investor confidence. When Phase 7 begins, the price will climb to $0.040—a 15% jump from current levels. This is the last chance to buy in at these discounted rates before the presale advances further. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also undergone rigorous technical due diligence. The project was audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms in the world, with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 78.00. The audit included both manual code review and static analysis, confirming the integrity and resilience of the smart contracts. Backing this is a strong and growing community with over 12,000 Twitter followers and thousands of active participants across its social channels. The project is also running a $100,000 giveaway , with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. A $50,000 bug bounty program is also in place to encourage ongoing transparency and improvement. Listing, beta launch, and ecosystem roadmap signal explosive growth ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just hype—it’s a protocol with a strategic roadmap and clear execution phases. With much of Phase 1 completed, the project is actively building the core components of its infrastructure, including smart contracts, backend logic, and the frontend interface. This sets the stage for the upcoming beta launch, expected to go live around the token’s listing. The beta phase will allow real users to interact with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s core features, lending and borrowing in live conditions—a milestone that is expected to significantly increase demand for MUTM tokens. Another key catalyst is the planned integration of Layer-2 scalability. This upgrade will enable faster transactions and dramatically reduce gas fees, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more competitive than most traditional DeFi platforms. By solving one of DeFi’s biggest friction points, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as not just functional but superior in user experience. Furthermore, once listed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to make its way onto major centralized exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC. This will expose the token to a far broader user base and institutional visibility, both of which are critical for sustained long-term price appreciation. Investors who got in during Phase 1 at $0.01 are already up 250%. When the token lists at $0.06, its return hits 500%. A post-listing price of $0.12 pushes those returns to 1,100%. Even buyers at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035 will be looking at 71% gains at listing and a 242% return if MUTM climbs to $0.12 in the weeks that follow. As attention continues to shift from aging giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers something their ecosystems no longer can: early entry with room to grow. For those searching for the best altcoin to back this summer, the numbers, timing, and structure of MUTM make it hard to ignore.

2025-08-05 06:31:09,49566557,1754375469,Payment Processor Remitly Plans Stablecoin Rollout for International Transfers,"Remitly plans to introduce stablecoin functionality to its global payment network, marking a big shift in how the remittance company enables international money transfers. The Seattle-based fintech, known for serving immigrants and overseas workers, aims to improve speed, reliability and cost efficiency for users in over 170 countries. The company announced Monday it will begin integrating stablecoins across three key areas of its business — value storage, treasury operations and global disbursements. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar and are designed to maintain price stability, making them attractive for payments in emerging markets. Stablecoin Payouts Coming to Remitly Transfers via Bridge Remitly’s first move is the launch of Remitly Wallet, a multi-currency digital wallet supporting both fiat and stablecoins. The product is currently in beta testing and is expected to go live in September. The wallet will allow users to store and use funds flexibly across borders, a feature the company says is especially useful in countries experiencing inflation or currency volatility. At the same time, Remitly is adding stablecoin payout options to its global transfer network through a partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider owned by Stripe. We're so excited to be partnering with @remitly to power their stablecoin rails, enhancing the flexibility and reach of their global disbursement network! Read about the partnership here: https://t.co/7BIhoYh8K8 — Bridge (@Stablecoin) August 4, 2025 Starting in select markets this September, customers will be able to receive funds in stablecoins, routed directly from Remitly’s existing fiat system into supported wallets. USDC Now Part of Remitly’s Real-Time Treasury Operations The company’s fiat payment network already covers more than 170 countries. It supports various delivery methods, including bank transfers, mobile wallets and cash pickup at over 470,000 locations. Now, with the addition of stablecoins, Remitly aims to expand both the flexibility and reach of its services even further. Remitly is also integrating stablecoins like USDC into its internal treasury operations. By tokenizing portions of its US dollar reserves, the firm says it can move funds instantly across time zones and during weekends, reducing the need for pre-funded local currency pools and unlocking capital for more efficient liquidity management. The stablecoin rollout builds on Remitly’s early crypto involvement. In 2021, the company supported fiat off-ramps for platforms like Coinbase and Novi, helping users convert crypto assets into local currency. That experience laid the foundation for its current approach, which ties Web3 infrastructure to real-world financial needs. Stablecoins Positioned to Lower Global Transfer Costs The company says the move responds to evolving customer needs. At the same time, it reflects broader industry trends. According to the World Bank, global remittance fees average 6.26%. Stablecoins could significantly reduce these costs, especially in regions with weak or unreliable banking infrastructure. Meanwhile, Remitly notes growing demand among its users — freelancers, small businesses and families, for ways to preserve value and avoid the risks of local currency depreciation. Stablecoins, especially dollar-backed ones, offer a way to hold money in a form that resists local inflation while remaining liquid. By combining blockchain-based settlement with its licensed and compliant fiat network, Remitly is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. It hopes the move will strengthen user trust and widen access to cross-border financial tools.

The Economic Revitalization Minister said his team “will push” the U.S. to ensure the executive order is prioritized and “the agreed tariff on automobiles and automotive components” is effected “as soon as possible.” Akazawa also mentioned that Japan was trying to avoid the “stacking” problem, where multiple tariffs could impact its goods. Last week, Prime Minister Ishiba said Japan exported nearly 4.318K products to the U.S. He added that his country was preparing necessary measures to cushion the effects of the high auto tariffs. Japan initially wanted those tariffs removed, but the U.S. stood its ground, leading Japan to agree to lower taxes. However, Akazawa was quoted last week saying it could take time for the 15% auto tariff rate to be effected. He hopes his team will succeed and seal the deal, similar to the auto tariff agreement recently entered into by the U.S. and Britain. Hayashi says the executive order will reduce uncertainty The Chief Cabinet Secretary recently said President Trump’s executive order to cut tariffs on Japanese automobile exports to the U.S. would reduce the uncertainty over “U.S. trade policy.” It would also mitigate the “downside risks” likely to affect Japan’s economy. If successful, the revised tariffs will be implemented from August 7. They were initially expected to take effect on August 1. Hayashi disclosed that Japan would continue to call on the U.S. to implement the revised bilateral agreement as soon as possible. He added that his country “will closely monitor” the progress on these talks on cars and auto parts. According to Hayashi and other Japanese officials, higher tariffs on Japanese cars dealt a massive blow to carmaking companies like Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp . The U.S. market is critical for both companies’ bottom lines. “We will continue to call for the United States to take measures to implement the bilateral agreement swiftly, including reductions in tariffs on cars and auto parts.” – Yoshimasa Hayashi , Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan Akazawa also emphasized that Japanese exports to the U.S. with a more than 15% levy should be exempted from the additional 15%. However, the head of the Democratic Party for the People, Yuichiro Tamaki, worried that the revised deal would not be enough to minimize the negative impact of tariffs on Japan’s economy. Noda believes the new deal should be formalized The head of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, Yoshihiko Noda, preferred the U.S.-Japan trade deal to be formalized in writing. He added that the signing should be a public event, like a bilateral summit. The former Prime Minister also stressed the need for the Japanese government to “draw up” an economic stimulus package to address any “tariff fallout.” However, he pointed out that Prime Minister Ishiba had not mentioned a supplementary budget for the 2025/26 fiscal year. Ishiba recently urged officials who attended a government task force meeting to “take all possible steps” to ease the impact of Trump’s tariffs. He claimed that the country’s economists had predicted things would be slow in the “export-driven economy.” However, just a day after the U.S.-Japan deal, the U.S. announced that Japan would buy $8 billion worth of U.S. farm and food products, such as bioethanol, fertilizers, corn, and soybeans. It also said Japan would buy more U.S.-made defense equipment worth billions of dollars annually. The Asian U.S. ally is also expected to buy about 100 Boeing planes.

2025-08-05 06:20:00,49566607,1754374800,List of 3 Cardano (ADA) Alternatives Priced Under $0.15 That Could Hit $1 Or More This Bull Run,"Looking for Cardano alternatives under $0.15 with a potential to reach $1 or more in this bull cycle? Kaspa and VeChain remain top choices since they are affordable and possess compelling use cases. But Remittix, a fast-emerging cross-chain DeFi hub, is also picking up steam as a utility token with tremendous upside under $0.10 in price. While the majority of altcoins are not real-world focused, Remittix is vying for real crypto-to-fiat transactions, and a beta wallet will soon be arriving. These tokens, along with Kaspa and VeChain, represent low-cost entry points for investors looking for the next big altcoin to invest in 2025. Kaspa & VeChain: Budget-Friendly Options Under $0.15 Kaspa (KAS) trades around $0.08903, up some 4.88%, with a market cap of near $2.36 billion, and 24‑hour volume of $64.2 million, down about 16.65%. Kaspa’s strategy is focused on DAG‑based scalable transactions and fast block times. Price forecasts tend to cap its 2025 potential at below $0.23, and there are few who believe KAS will reach $1 before 2030 unless the acceptance accelerates sharply. VeChain (VET) stands at $0.02329, having decreased by 0.64%, and its market capitalization is around $2 billion while daily trading volume is about $37.1 million, down 8.2%. VeChain centers on supply-chain use cases with enterprise partnerships like Walmart China. Forecasts vary, but by the last quarter of 2025 price may reach more than $0.05 in optimistic forecasts. Neither VeChain nor Kaspa appears to touch $1 in this bull cycle based on current scale and growth trends—but they remain inexpensive tokens under $0.15. Remittix (RTX): Under-$0.10 Token That Actually Has Utility A great substitute for speculation tokens is Remittix (RTX) —a cross-chain DeFi token that represents a practical layer between crypto and fiat payments. At $0.0895 per token, Remittix has already sold more than 580 million+ tokens and raised more than $18 million, close to its soft cap. As opposed to Kaspa or VeChain, Remittix is targeting global remittances—enabling users to remit cryptocurrency to bank accounts in over 30 countries with real-time FX conversion and low gas fees. It just released its beta wallet, coming out in Q3 2025, with mobile-first UX and cross-chain support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Why Remittix Can Grow Further in This Cycle Global Reach: Payments to real bank accounts around the world Product-Ready: Beta wallet coming soon Presale Hype: $18 million + funded and tokens in demand soon Incentives: 40% token incentive now available Community Expansion: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway connecting stakeholders Remittix is crypto with real utility, offering an onramp for early-stage investors and growth-oriented crypto hunters seeking real application. If you’re holding your watch on Kaspa, VeChain, or Cardano as sub-$0.15 plays, it’s worth watching Remittix, which has affordability, utility, and high project traction—all while preparing to roll out the wallet and make listing announcements.

2025-08-05 06:17:27,49567517,1754374647,From coffee money to $5: This token mirrors early BTC growth in terms of ROI,"Early phase investor gains mirror Bitcoin (BTC)’s rise Consider an investor who diversified $1,000 from popular cryptocurrencies such as AVAX or SOL during Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 1 presale, when the token price was just $0.01. Fast forward to Phase 6 pricing at $0.035, and that same investment would now be valued at approximately $3,500, reflecting a remarkable 250% gain. But the growth story doesn’t stop there. With the presale advancing and listing anticipated at $0.06, projections suggest the token could reach $0.60 or beyond in the future, representing a staggering 60x return on early capital. This kind of return aligns with Bitcoin (BTC)’s early growth pattern, where investors who believed in the concept at ground level witnessed unparalleled profits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers this rare chance to capture similar exponential gains before the wider market fully embraces the token’s potential. The steadily increasing interest, rising number of holders, and growing capital raised all signal a powerful momentum building behind MUTM. The mechanics behind the growth What fuels this growth potential is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative approach to decentralized finance. At its core lies the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system, where users deposit stablecoins or blue-chip assets like ETH and USDT, receiving mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens accumulate yield automatically, increasing in value without requiring constant user intervention. This compounding effect provides a steady, passive income stream that benefits holders over time. Beyond simple yield generation, mtTokens can be staked within Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts to earn additional MUTM tokens. This staking mechanism not only increases holdings without added risk but also reinforces long-term loyalty to the ecosystem. To enhance scarcity and support token value, a portion of the platform revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, actively controlling the circulating supply and creating upward price pressure. This blend of automatic interest accrual, dual-token rewards, and buyback strategies sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from traditional DeFi projects, offering users a comprehensive system designed for sustainable growth. Presale details fueling excitement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. Over 10% of the allocated 170 million tokens for this phase have already been snapped up by a rapidly expanding community exceeding 14,900 holders. This phase alone has attracted more than $14 million in capital, reflecting strong confidence in the project’s future. The next phase will see the token price increase by 15% to $0.040, emphasizing urgency for those eyeing entry before costs rise. With a total supply capped at four billion MUTM tokens, demand pulls scenario will become an increasingly important factor in price discovery. Security and trust are central pillars of the project, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) passing a thorough CertiK audit, scoring an impressive 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet. Additional incentives such as a $100,000 giveaway —where ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM—and an active $50,000 bug bounty program contribute to growing community engagement and confidence. Bitcoin (BTC)’s early believers find a new frontier Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a compelling chance to replicate the early successes of Bitcoin (BTC), still trading below $0.04 and backed by a clear, ambitious roadmap. The upcoming Beta launch at listing will enable users to interact with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s full DeFi suite from day one, signaling a significant milestone toward mainstream adoption. Layer-2 integration is set to provide low gas fees and scalable infrastructure, solving many of the pain points that early DeFi users have encountered elsewhere. Coupled with anticipated major exchange listings on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and others, these developments will open the floodgates for liquidity and mass user participation. This combination of proven fundamentals, growing adoption, and carefully planned expansion makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an unmatched opportunity in today’s market. The time to act is now For many, the decision to skip their daily coffee and invest that small amount instead in Bitcoin (BTC)’s early days was the start of extraordinary financial journeys. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a similar “coffee money bet” with the potential to deliver comparable returns. Phase 6 is progressing quickly, and once the price jumps to $0.040, the window to buy at $0.035 will have closed. Investors who move now position themselves ahead of the curve, gaining early exposure to a platform poised for massive growth. This is more than just another token presale—it’s an invitation to be part of what could become one of the most significant DeFi success stories of 2025. Don’t let this chance slip by. The future of your portfolio might just start with a $5 coffee-sized investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

The European Union will suspend two planned tariff countermeasure packages for six months after reaching an agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump, an EU Commission spokesperson confirmed Monday. Gold prices held steady at around $3,370 per ounce on Tuesday following three days of gains, supported by growing expectations of a US interest rate cut in September. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.69% to around 40,500, while the broader Topix Index added 0.4% to 2,928 on Tuesday, rebounding from the prior session’s losses.

The S&P Global Japan Services PMI rose to 53.6 in July 2025, slightly above the flash estimate of 53.5 and up from 51.7 in the previous month, marking the fourth straight month of expansion and the fastest pace since February. The S&P Global Japan Composite PMI came in at 51.6 in July 2025. Investors also digested minutes from the Bank of Japan’s June meeting , which showed policymakers remain open to additional rate hikes if trade tensions ease. However, the board reiterated that current interest rates remain appropriate given ongoing uncertainties. A Japanese Labour Ministry panel recommended on Monday a hike of 63 yen, or 6.0%, in the average minimum hourly wage for this fiscal year.

India's Foreign Ministry on Monday rejected U.S. and E.U. criticism of its Russian oil imports as ""unjustified and unreasonable."" The country's spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, said the purchases are necessary to provide affordable and stable fuel prices to its citizens.

2025-08-05 06:10:10,49565687,1754374210,Unveiling Critical BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling Critical BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Understanding the pulse of the cryptocurrency market is crucial for any trader or investor. One of the most telling indicators of market sentiment, especially for Bitcoin, comes from analyzing BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios. These ratios offer a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate price increases (longs) or decreases (shorts). What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Reveal? For those engaged in crypto trading , knowing the collective leanings of the market can provide a significant edge. The long-short ratio essentially compares the number of long positions to short positions on perpetual futures contracts. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 points to more short positions, indicating bearish sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures across various exchanges shows a slight lean towards short positions. The total ratio stands at: Total: Long 49.47%, Short 50.53% This suggests that, overall, a marginally larger percentage of traders are betting on a downward price movement for Bitcoin in the immediate future. Analyzing Current Market Sentiment: Why It Matters for Crypto Trading Gauging market sentiment is not just an academic exercise; it has practical implications for your trading strategy. When the market is predominantly short, it might signal potential capitulation or, conversely, an opportunity for a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly reverse. Conversely, a heavily long market could be ripe for a correction. It is important to remember that these ratios represent aggregated positions and do not necessarily predict future price movements with certainty. However, they do reflect the current psychological state of the market participants, which can often influence short-term trends. Monitoring these shifts helps traders adapt their strategies. Diving Deeper into Bitcoin Derivatives: Exchange-Specific Insights While the overall picture gives us a broad understanding, examining individual exchanges provides a more granular view of Bitcoin derivatives activity. Different exchanges attract different types of traders, and their specific ratios can sometimes reveal localized trends or the influence of larger players on a particular platform. Here are the 24-hour long-short ratios for three prominent exchanges: Binance: Long 48.78%, Short 51.22% Bybit: Long 47.03%, Short 52.97% Gate.io: Long 49.20%, Short 50.80% Notice that Bybit shows the strongest short bias among the top three, indicating a more bearish outlook from its user base compared to Binance or Gate.io. This variance highlights the diverse trading behaviors across platforms, which is crucial for comprehensive market analysis. Actionable Insights from Futures Contracts Data What can you do with this information about futures contracts ? Firstly, use it as a complementary tool, not a standalone indicator. Combine long-short ratios with technical analysis, on-chain data, and macroeconomic factors for a more robust trading plan. Secondly, be aware of extremes. Historically, extreme long or short biases have sometimes preceded market reversals. If everyone is on one side of the trade, the potential for a swift move in the opposite direction increases. For instance, a sudden shift from a heavily short-biased market to a more balanced or even long-biased one could signal a change in momentum. Conversely, if short positions continue to dominate, it might confirm a prevailing bearish trend, prompting caution for those considering long entries. Navigating the Dynamics of BTC Perpetual Futures The world of BTC perpetual futures is dynamic and constantly evolving. Staying informed about these crucial metrics helps you navigate its complexities. Understanding who is long and who is short provides a valuable lens through which to view potential price action and market sentiment shifts. Always conduct your own research and consider multiple data points before making any trading decisions. By regularly reviewing long-short ratios, you empower yourself with a deeper understanding of the collective market psychology, enabling more informed and potentially more profitable crypto trading strategies. This data is a powerful tool for anticipating market shifts and managing risk effectively. In conclusion, the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a vital snapshot of current market sentiment. While the slight short bias across major exchanges indicates a cautious outlook, understanding these dynamics on an exchange-specific level provides deeper insights. Utilize this data as part of a comprehensive analysis to enhance your decision-making in the volatile crypto markets. Staying informed about these metrics is key to successful trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a long-short ratio in crypto trading? The long-short ratio compares the total number of open long positions (bets on price increase) to open short positions (bets on price decrease) for a specific cryptocurrency on derivatives exchanges. It indicates prevailing market sentiment. Why are BTC perpetual futures important for market analysis? BTC perpetual futures are widely traded derivatives that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price without owning the underlying asset. Their long-short ratios provide a real-time gauge of bullish or bearish sentiment among a large segment of crypto traders. How do different exchanges’ long-short ratios vary? Long-short ratios can vary significantly between exchanges due to differences in user bases, liquidity, and regional trading preferences. Analyzing these individual exchange ratios can reveal specific trading behaviors and localized sentiment trends. Can long-short ratios predict future Bitcoin price movements? While long-short ratios are strong indicators of current market sentiment, they are not direct predictors of future price movements. They are best used as a complementary tool alongside technical analysis, on-chain data, and other fundamental factors to form a comprehensive trading strategy. What does a higher short percentage mean for BTC perpetual futures? A higher short percentage, as seen in the recent data, indicates that a larger proportion of traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to fall. This suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term, though extreme biases can sometimes precede reversals. Found this analysis of BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios insightful?

2025-08-05 06:00:29,49565251,1754373629,Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer,"After falling below a crucial support level, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to recover some of its lost ground. An analyst suggested that this week’s performance will be decisive for the cryptocurrency’s next trend. Related Reading: Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is Headed For $9,000 After This Broadening Wedge Retest Bitcoin Loses Bull Flag Formation Over the weekend, Bitcoin lost its post-breakout range for the first time in three weeks, falling to a local low of $112,296 on August 3. The flagship crypto had been trading between the $114,000-$120,000 range since the early July breakout, hitting its all-time high (ATH) of $122,838 amid the rally. As July neared its end, BTC experienced some volatility, retesting the range lows twice over its last week. However, the cryptocurrency was unable to repeat its price recovery from the previous weekend, losing the crucial area on August 1. Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin’s rally could be at risk, explaining that BTC has formed a bull flag in the weekly chart and held the pattern’s lows as support until the latest Weekly Close. Following its recent price action, the analyst considers that this week’s performance will be pivotal to see whether the pattern’s bottom, around the $117,200 area, will become a new resistance and confirm the breakdown, or if the flagship crypto’s price will recover the structure. According to the analysis, if the price can reclaim the structure, the correction would be considered a fake downside deviation before resynchronizing with the pattern. Meanwhile, turning the pattern’s bottom into resistance would be a bearish retest, confirming the breakdown, and potentially leading to a new retest of the $112,000 area as support. BTC’s Weekly Close To Determine Next Trend Rekt Capital also detailed that this week’s performance will determine the future of BTC’s second Price Discovery uptrend, which has technically started its fifth week. Depending on what happens to the Bull Flag (reclaim or a confirmation of the breakdown), we will know whether the Price Discovery Uptrend 2 will continue or whether BTC has experienced a very short PDU2 instead. Last week, the analyst retesting that the continuation of the Price Discovery trend could fail as BTC transitioned into weeks 5-7 of this phase. Historically, the second uptrend has started to slow down around Weeks 5-6, hitting its peak during this “Danger Zone.” If Bitcoin reclaims the Bull Flag and challenges new highs, then its second Price Discovery uptrend will progress according to its historical tendencies. However, if it fails to Weekly Close above the pattern’s bottom and confirms additional downside, the second Price Discovery uptrend would have ended in Week 2, much quicker than has historically been the case. Moreover, it would reveal that BTC has been in its second Price Discovery Correction, which “would be going completely against the grain of history.” Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level The analyst suggested that macro-wise, Bitcoin still has plenty of time for a third Price Discovery uptrend. If the second phase has already ended, a final uptrend could overcompensate for the current uptrend’s underperformance. Previously, Rekt Capital asserted that what comes after the second uptrend would depend on how long the corrective phase takes, as a shot correction could allow for a third uptrend before the bear market.

2025-08-05 06:00:07,49565172,1754373607,Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With Massive Third-Largest Acquisition,"Michael Saylor’s enterprise software company, Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), has made headlines once again with a substantial Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition, pushing its total holdings beyond 600,000 coins. The company purchased an impressive $2.46 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past week, marking its third-largest purchase by dollar amount since it began acquiring the digital asset five years ago. Bitcoin Acquisition At Record Prices Between July 28 and August 3, Strategy added 21,021 Bitcoin to its holdings, bringing its total to 628,791 tokens. At current market prices, the firm’s portfolio is valued at over $71 billion. Saylor has adeptly transformed his company from a traditional software provider into the leading corporate buyer of Bitcoin, utilizing innovative financial strategies to fuel these purchases. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ The latest acquisition was made at an average price of $117,526 per token, which is the second-highest price the company has ever paid, just shy of the $118,940 average from the previous month. Strategy is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. BTC mining company MARA Holdings is second with 50,000 coins, which highlights Saylor’s firm’s purchasing power. Notably, this position has not only solidified Saylor’s influence in the crypto space but has also inspired other public companies to adopt similar treasury strategies aimed at accumulating and holding digital currencies. These include Trump’s social media company, boosted by a new regulatory regime and legislation in the US aimed at positioning the country as the crypto capital of the world, a mission that President Donald Trump has advocated since his election campaign last year. Saylor’s Strategy Pledges To Protect Shareholder Value To fund these massive purchases, Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor has employed a mix of common and preferred share sales alongside debt instruments. Recently, the company launched its latest preferred stock offering, dubbed “Stretch,” in late July. In its second-quarter report, Strategy announced an unrealized gain of $14 billion, primarily driven by the recent rebound in Bitcoin prices and a new accounting requirement that necessitated the revaluation of its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor has also made a commitment to investors, stating that he will refrain from issuing new common shares at less than 2.5 times the company’s net asset value, except for covering debt interest or preferred dividends. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level This pledge comes in light of concerns raised by critics like Jim Chanos, who have expressed apprehension about the premium that Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings place on its share price and the numerous securities offerings the company has executed. Since its initial foray into Bitcoin, Strategy’s stock, MSTR, has skyrocketed over 3,000%, significantly outperforming Bitcoin itself and major stock indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. The company’s largest purchases occurred in November, totaling $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, demonstrating Saylor’s aggressive strategy in the cryptocurrency market. However, on Monday, the firm did not disclose any further purchases, as it has commonly done over the past few months. Perhaps it is starting to reassess its direction with biweekly acquisitions. It remains to be seen what the firm’s next moves will be, as there have been no further official comments on the matter.

CEO Shin Jin-wook already faces a 7-year sentence in prison for stealing 10 billion won ($7.5 million) worth of customer deposits. South Korean media outlet Digital Asset reported that a Daegu District Court judge sentenced Shin for his alleged involvement in Bitsonic Coin (BSC) fraud. CEO Admits to Bitsonic Coin Fraud The CEO defrauded customers for a total of 160 million won ($115K) “by inflating BSC trading volume and market price after inducing transactions through false announcements,” the verdict noted. Shin used false KRW points obtained via buybacks to purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum from members. He later converted the digital assets into cash and invested in firms unrelated to the exchange, it added. Additionally, he falsified the lockup period, only to discover that neither the investment nor interest could be returned to investors. “Although Mr. Shin was unable to reach an agreement with the victims, he admitted his wrongdoing and is reflecting on it,” said Judge Seong Gi-jun. “The sentencing conditions, including the motive and circumstances of the crime, were taken into consideration when determining the sentence.” Here’s How Bitsonic Chiefs Landed in “Lenient” Sentences In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic’s chief technology officer, surnamed Bae, were sentenced to a combined 8 years in prison for manipulating crypto prices and hugely profiting from them. Per a Seoul District Court, Shin had “reached an agreement with two of the victims who suffered the largest amount of damages,” at the time. Further, neither CEO Shin nor Bae had a history of committing similar types of crime, the Judge noted. This led the Judge to sentence both Bitsonic chiefs to a “lenient” sentence. Besides, under South Korean law, defendants can appeal guilty verdicts and sentences at the High Court and the Supreme Court.

The billionaire’s purchase comes as Yuga Labs looks to reinvent itself as the producer of the most valuable items. In an X post Monday, Weitsman announced the purchase of 5,000 NFTs from Otherside collections, including Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas, and Weapon Kodas. The acquisition comes directly from items held by Yuga Labs in an OTC deal. Weitsman also plans to acquire more NFTs on the open market, putting trust in the Otherside ecosystem. Today is a special day for me. I’m making a long-term investment in Otherside and acquiring over 5,000 Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas and Weapon Kodas direct from @yugalabs to continue building my collection. I have also committed to making a series of acquisitions on the open market… pic.twitter.com/I9HeQwNx5k — Adam Weitsman (@AdamWeitsman) August 4, 2025 The co-founder of Yuga Labs Wylie Aronow praised the conviction of Weitsman for his readiness to expand his personal collection. “Grateful to have Adam double down as a partner and builder for this next phase of Otherside. No one better to have in our corner ,” said Greg Solano, co-founder of Yuga Labs. Weitsman will lock the NFT for years, betting on the long-term development of the Otherside metaverse. Yuga Labs focuses on Otherside after selling IP to top collections Yuga Labs was in the process of rearranging its intellectual property, selling CryptoPunks and Moonbirds to third-party curators. The Otherside will be a new area of focus, as gaming and NFTs made a return in 2025. The purchase arrived just days after the Otherside metaverse opened to users and held its first Bubble event and virtual meetup. Yuga Labs owned 10,400 Otherside NFTs, essentially selling nearly half its holdings. Following the announcement, the Otherside collection increased its floor price to a one-month peak of 0.19 ETH. The Otherside collections are relatively minor compared to Punks and Bored Apes, but show a readiness to revive metaverse games and gamified NFTs. Otherside Meta aims to draw big collectors The initial Otherside collections launched years before the expansion of the Yuga Labs metaverse. Some of the items were exclusive and extremely expensive to mint. The Otherside collections may expand in the future, with a large number of items. Yuga Labs aims to reach out to a large audience while also appealing to top whales and collectors. This time around, the collection may be better protected from mint snipers, who front-ran buyers during the original NFT creation. Big collectors are making moves. With Bubbles, Bathroom Blitz, and Otherside Outbreak releasing this month, people are starting to understand the potential of @OthersideMeta – community built experiences. It's not just about what Yuga can make, the real story is about what… pic.twitter.com/xgaKvClRwZ — figge (@mfigge) August 2, 2025 The current slow period for NFTs means Otherside items are traded by a few dozen participants at best. The collections are not inaccessible or rare, with more items and extensions coming in the next few months. Otherside aims to bring back real engagement and revive the 2021 rush to metaverse games. Otherdeeds characters and items are still not clearly linked to their in-game utility. The NFT collections may go through a value discovery period as the game progresses. In the future, the Otherside meta may start to reward players with crypto payments, reviving the play-to-earn model. For now, Yuga Labs draws in a few hundred players for its special events, similar to the early days of on-chain games. The attempt to revive NFT-based gaming after years of almost no activity may be a challenge, as some investors remain skeptical.

2025-08-04 19:44:23,49539933,1754336663,"Hyperliquid, Pump.fun, Conflux Lead August Altcoin Season Mini-Rally – Is a Rotation Here?","Talk of an altcoin season has resurfaced in early August , even as the Altcoin Season Index remains below the 75-point threshold. Traders are watching for tokens that combine active ecosystems with liquidity, and three names—Hyperliquid, Pump.fun, and Conflux—are coming up in that conversation. While Bitcoin dominance remains above 60%, selective altseason rotations are still putting these tokens in focus. Hyperliquid: Trading Platform Meets Speculation Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to attract attention in derivatives trading. The HYPE price sits around $38 , according to CoinMarketCap, with a market cap near $12.9 billion. Daily trading volume remains steady at nearly $200 million. Although still about 23% off its all‑time high of $49.86 reached in mid‑July, the project has maintained consistent liquidity. The appeal comes from its Layer‑1 infrastructure, which supports a fully on‑chain order book and zero‑gas perpetual trading. Holders use the token for governance, fee rebates, and trading incentives. With derivatives activity on the rise, Hyperliquid has positioned itself as a token that bridges protocol use and trader momentum. While some analysts question whether the rally has peaked, the steady user base and on‑chain activity suggest HYPE may continue to feature in altseason debates. Pump.fun: Meme Energy for Exchange Liquidity Pump.fun’s native token, PUMP, has become one of the most discussed Solana‑based assets in recent weeks. The Pump.fun price is around $0.003, with a $1.05 billion market cap and daily volume above $390 million. Although the token trades 75% below its July peak of $0.01214, its liquidity remains strong. PUMP Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The token is linked to the Pump.fun launchpad, a platform that has powered thousands of meme coin launches. Recent buybacks funded from platform revenue have helped support the market. Analysts say PUMP’s role is less about deep utility and more about channeling trading energy within Solana’s meme ecosystem. For traders looking at altcoin season plays, Pump.fun shows how meme‑driven tokens with real liquidity pools can still attract short‑term flows. Conflux: A Utility Play in the Mix Unlike the other two, Conflux brings an infrastructure angle. The Conflux price is holding near $0.21 , with a market cap of about $1.09 billion and the 24‑hour volume above $268 million. Circulating supply is just over 5.1 billion CFX. Conflux operates as a Layer‑1 smart contract network using a hybrid Tree‑Graph consensus. The chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and features low fees through a sponsored gas model. Activity has been rising, supported by DeFi integrations, staking, and cross‑chain bridges. Performance in the past week has been stronger than some peers, suggesting traders may be rotating into CFX as part of selective altseason positioning. Altseason Sentiment Still Cautious The Altcoin Season Index has increased slightly to 44 , meaning Bitcoin is still outperforming most altcoins. Yet, selective gains for HYPE, Pump.fun, and Conflux show that market participants are willing to explore outside the majors when liquidity and activity support the move. For now, this looks less like a broad altcoin season and more like an altseason in pockets. Traders are choosing tokens with active platforms, meme traction, or infrastructure use cases. Hyperliquid, Pump.fun, and Conflux each check one of those boxes, keeping them in rotation as August unfolds.

With USDe’s market cap rising and new regulated products launching, Ethena’s synthetic dollar project is gaining momentum. Traders are now asking important questions as they watch whether $ENA can challenge its next resistance level. Source: Coingecko $ENA’s 140% July Rally: Whales & Institutions Driving Demand Ethena is a crypto-native synthetic dollar protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. Its flagship stablecoin, USDe, uses a delta-neutral strategy (long spot, short futures) to maintain a dollar peg and generate yield via sUSDe, without relying on traditional banking assets. This offers censorship resistance and flexibility but adds complexity and risk if market dynamics change. $ENA is the governance/utility token of the Ethena network, with the maximum supply being 15 billion tokens. Circulating supply and rich-list dynamics suggest a relatively distributed holder base, according to Etherscan . Additionally, USDe’s market cap has surged 75% within a month, with recent reports showing it has eclipsed $9.29 billion. This makes it the third-largest stablecoin by supply and drives capital inflows into the protocol. That explosive growth fed directly into $ENA’s narrative: the governance token rallied strongly, gaining between 140% and 155% in July while weekly trading volume surged to approximately $1.41 billion and open interest climbed about 30%. ENA rally heats up: Ethena surged 155% in July and added another 14% this week as trading volume and futures interest spiked. But with the price dipping below key support at $0.55, $0.49 now stands as the crucial level to watch. #ENA #Crypto https://t.co/QtN7fIrdZZ — TWJ News (@TronWeekly) August 3, 2025 That institutional move was amplified when Arthur Hayes publicly committed roughly $1.06 million to $ENA in late July, sparking an immediate price reaction. Whale behavior mirrored institutional interest, with large holders accumulating some 79.25 million ENA in a single week. Additionally, Ethena partnered with federally regulated Anchorage Digital to issue USDtb, billed as the first U.S. GENIUS Act–compliant stablecoin, introducing a regulated onshore dollar product alongside its more experimental USDe. According to DeFiLlama data, the total value locked (TVL) of the $ENA token is over $9.5 billion , ranking it among the top six DeFi protocols as of early August 2025. On-chain analytics also indicate growing adoption, and a large percentage of $ENA tokens are held by large whales, indicating commitment from the big players. If trends persist with growing USDe adoption, USDtb-driven regulatory clarity, and strong whale confidence, analysts project $ENA could reach between $1.00 and $1.50 by year-end, with higher targets possible if the ecosystem expands further. $ENA Tests $0.68 Resistance Again After Rounded Retest From $0.54 Base $ENA is making another approach toward the $0.68 resistance level after completing a rounded retest pattern that began forming following last month’s rejection . This level capped the price during the previous rally, which was fueled by an 18% price jump tied to wallet activity from large investors like Arthur Hayes and sharp increases in derivatives positioning. $ENA/$USDT price chart, August 4 (Source: TradingView) That move carried $ENA/$USDT from a base near $0.54 to a high of $0.6864 before momentum faded into supply. The current climb back to this zone unfolds more gradually and with less visible leverage, creating a structurally healthier setup. The 4-hour chart shows a clearly defined rounded retest, with price curling higher off the $0.54 low and maintaining higher lows throughout. Volume during the climb has been consistent, though no breakout influx has occurred yet. This helps distinguish the current advance from the earlier parabolic move, which was accompanied by funding spikes and liquidation clusters. The market structure remains intact above the trendline, and the bias remains to the upside so long as price holds above $0.61 on intraday pullbacks. The 30-minute footprint chart offers more nuance. From $0.6060 up through $0.6180, volume is fairly distributed, but the delta profile reveals sporadic selling into strength. A sequence of three consecutive red deltas from 08:00 to 09:30 UTC totaled more than -5.7 million, despite average-sized candles. That points to passive sellers still present in the region. However, bulls have managed to hold the price firm above $0.6160 despite that resistance, suggesting either absorption or fatigue on the sell side. This retest of $0.68 comes without the crowded long positioning that characterized last week’s breakout attempt. Derivatives data earlier this week showed excessive long exposure with a top-heavy long/short ratio, particularly on Binance and Bybit. That has since normalized, reducing the risk of liquidation-driven retracements. If the bulls can reclaim $0.662 and push through $0.684 on volume, the previous high at $0.6864 becomes vulnerable again. On the other hand, failure to do so, especially if the delta turns sharply negative again near resistance, may result in a local double top, leading to a price drop. Until then, the trend remains constructive, with the market waiting to see whether the supply wall at $0.68 has weakened since the last test.

2025-08-04 19:28:25,49544203,1754335705,5 Coins Under $0.40 Predicted to Eclipse Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) With 6000% Gains in 2025,"As of writing, Cardano trades at $0.78, while Solana sits at $180.50. Both projects are positioned for notable gains in 2025, with ADA projected to rise as high as $2.36 (a ~200% increase) and SOL aiming for a mega-bullish peak of $395, potentially doubling current levels. Yet despite these projections, a new wave of low-cap altcoins under $0.40 is gearing up to deliver even greater returns—and some analysts believe they could outperform the likes of Cardano and Solana with 6000%+ surges by year-end. Below, we break down 5 coins under $0.40 with explosive potential in 2025, starting with a meme-fueled Layer-2 juggernaut turning heads across the crypto space. Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—The Meme King of 2025 Current Presale Price: $0.0018 Listing Price: $0.003 Target: $0.09+ (5000% Surge) Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the rising prince of meme coins—and the most talked-about presale of 2025. Unlike typical meme tokens, LILPEPE combines viral meme culture with real utility by launching its own Layer-2 blockchain that boasts ultra-low gas fees, lightning-fast finality, and seamless Ethereum compatibility. As of writing, LILPEPE is in Stage 9 of its presale, with over $13.8M raised out of a $16.47 million target and nearly 10 billion tokens already sold. The project has recently been listed on CoinMarketCap, signaling rising legitimacy and growing investor confidence. LILPEPE’s unique zero-tax structure, presale vesting schedule, and robust tokenomics make it both a long-term play and a short-term breakout candidate. With whale interest evident from large presale purchases and social traction exploding on platforms like X and Telegram, many believe LILPEPE could deliver a 5,000% to 6,000% return once it launches at $0.003 and rallies toward the projected $0.09 mark. Adding more heat to the hype is the ongoing $777,000 giveaway , where ten lucky participants will win $77,000 worth of LILPEPE each. With over 161,000 entries already, it’s clear the community is all-in. Cronos (CRO)—Undervalued L1 With AI-Driven Growth Current Price (as of writing): $0.1435 2025 Target: $0.354 Cronos (CRO), the native token of Crypto.com’s blockchain, has recently gained bullish traction. The token rebounded from key support near $0.136 and now trades around $0.1435. Analysts predict a move toward $0.306–$0.354 by the end of 2025, up to 146% from current levels. The catalyst? Strong ecosystem development, a strategic partnership with Theta Network, and growing AI integrations within Cronos-based dApps. According to CoinPedia and CoinCodex, this consistent utility-driven growth makes CRO one of the most undervalued large-cap tokens under $0.20. Hedera (HBAR)—Enterprise-Grade Blockchain With a Bullish Reversal Current Price (as of writing): $0.26 2025 Target: $1.20 HBAR continues to attract attention from institutional players, and recent technical indicators suggest a potential breakout. With its hashgraph consensus and enterprise adoption (including partnerships with Google and IBM), Hedera stands as a serious contender to Ethereum alternatives. From its current price of $0.26, HBAR could soar to $1.20 by the end of 2025, representing a 361% return in a bullish scenario. Reddit analysts and StealthEX see it as a stealth altcoin capable of major rallies as on-chain volume spikes and accumulation increases. TRON (TRX)—Stablecoin Powerhouse With Hidden Strength Current Price (as of writing): $0.336 2025 Target: $0.48 TRON has flown under the radar, but don’t let the silence fool you. It now hosts over $80B in USDT volume, surpassing Ethereum in stablecoin transactions. Following its $100M Nasdaq reverse merger, TRON now sits in the top 10 by market cap. Analysts have made bullish predictions for TRX, stating a price of $0.43–$0.48 in August 2025, translating to a 40–50% gain. Suppose TRON continues expanding into the DeFi space and maintains its lead in stablecoin transaction volume. In that case, it can reach even higher milestones, especially if it manages to reclaim its all-time high of $0.45+. Dogecoin (DOGE)—Still the People’s Coin Current Price (as of writing): $0.2215 2025 Target: $0.70–$0.91 DOGE may be a legacy memecoin, but it’s not done yet. Despite a slight 24-hour dip, bullish patterns like weekly engulfing candles and strong whale support point to renewed upside momentum. In a best-case scenario, DOGE could reach $0.70 - $0.91 by the end of 2025, indicating a 3x – 4x increase. Bitget and TokenMetrics have also made positive projections, suggesting a DOGE rally following mainstream hype circuits, especially if the rest of the crypto market performs well. Conclusion: The Under-$0.40 Gems Ready for Liftoff Cardano and Solana remain respected pillars in the crypto world, but investors searching for explosive gains in 2025 should watch the under-$0.40 zone closely. From Hedera’s enterprise adoption to Cronos’ AI expansion and TRON’s stablecoin dominance, these altcoins are building strong foundations for growth. But above them all stands Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—the meme-turned-monarch leading a Layer-2 revolution. With whale interest, real blockchain utility, zero-tax trades, and a vibrant community, LILPEPE isn’t just another token. It’s a movement. And with projections suggesting a 5000%+ surge, the presale may be the last chance for investors to get in before the rocket ignites.

2025-08-04 19:24:34,49541785,1754335474,5 Best Meme Coins to Buy: 2025's Top Projects That Could See 4500% Gains,"As meme coins continue to dominate crypto headlines, 2025 will be a breakout year for several community-driven tokens. From newly launched projects with massive potential to seasoned players preparing for fresh rallies, a few standout contenders are making headlines—and gains. With multiple tokens already showing strong presale momentum, technical breakouts, and bullish projections, this article explores five top meme coins to watch closely. Each of these projects—including the breakout star Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—could be on track to deliver up to 4,500% gains before the year ends. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme King in the Making As of writing, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has concluded Stage 8 of its presale ahead of schedule, raising over $13.7 million and selling more than 9.75 billion tokens. Now, entering Stage 9, tokens are priced at $0.0018, with a launch listing price set at $0.003, which is already signaling a major upside. Recently listed on CoinMarketCap, $LILPEPE is gaining momentum as it blends meme culture with real utility through its proprietary Layer 2 blockchain. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, LILPEPE is engineered for speed, security, and scalability. With zero taxes, ultra-low fees, and an Ethereum-based (ERC-20) token structure, it offers something few meme coins can: actual infrastructure. The roadmap includes key milestones such as DEX/CEX listings, Layer 2 mainnet rollout, and staking rewards—all supported by a 13.5% allocation for holder incentives. LILPEPE’s $777,000 giveaway has further supercharged interest. By contributing at least $100 in the presale and completing simple community tasks, investors are automatically entered to win one of ten $77,000 token prizes. With viral marketing, a thriving presale, and a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, LILPEPE has the potential to rally by 4,500% as adoption kicks in and listings multiply. BRETT: Base Chain’s Meme Ambassador Currently trading around $0.0418, BRETT continues to impress as a top meme coin on the Base chain. Technical indicators remain strongly bullish with a market cap nearing $589 million. According to CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice, BRETT could easily see a jump toward $0.0722 or higher in 2025. Meanwhile, aggressive projections from Telegaon and PricePrediction suggest highs of $0.49, representing over 4,500% upside if the project continues to mirror the explosive growth of its ecosystem. BRETT stands out for its deep community engagement, low circulation inflation, and close association with the rapidly growing Base network. Analysts expect continued momentum as meme coin appetite surges and the project’s utility within Base deepens. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Crown Jewel of Culture Trading at $1.07 as of writing, Dogwifhat has cemented its place as a cultural powerhouse on Solana. With technicals showing a 60% win rate over the last 30 days and strong open interest in derivatives markets, WIF is one of the most institutionally tracked meme tokens today. Key bullish signals—such as an RSI trending near overbought and MACD flipping positive—point to an incoming breakout above $1.21, possibly targeting $1.68 short-term. Long-term forecasts peg WIF at $2.22 to $3.00 by late 2025, setting up a possible 4,500% return if bullish scenarios unfold and Solana’s narrative continues to strengthen. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): From NFTs to L2 Royalty Pudgy Penguins is currently priced at around $0.0408, with a robust $2.56 billion market cap and an expanding presence beyond NFTs. The launch of its native $PENGU token on Solana, paired with its Layer 2 infrastructure project Abstract, positions Pudgy Penguins as more than a nostalgic brand—it’s now a serious player in Web3 IP. Chart analysis reveals a bullish flag formation with a near-term price target of $0.052, and longer-term projections eye $0.068 to $0.091 by 2030. Analysts believe that with strong entertainment partnerships and NFT-linked product rollouts, PENGU could be a dark horse candidate for 4,500% growth, especially if its utility within Abstract takes off. SNEK: The Silent Climber With Technical Bite SNEK may have slithered under the radar in early 2025, but it’s now becoming impossible to ignore. Trading around $0.00366 to $0.00374 as of writing, SNEK is gaining steam with bullish technical indicators across all major platforms. Coindataflow shows 79% of indicators flashing bullish, and analysts predict a 2025 target of $0.00608 to $0.00662. The token recently emerged from a falling wedge pattern, with a positive MACD crossover and rising volume. A push past resistance around $0.0044 could unlock rapid upside. Long-term models see 70–80% gains and short-term gains, but in a full bull run, 4500% gains remain realistic, particularly if meme culture explodes in late 2025. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Wave of 2025 Is Just Beginning From cutting-edge Layer 2 tech to brand-backed Web3 ecosystems, meme coins are no longer just speculative plays—they’re becoming some of the most innovative and engaging crypto projects. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) leads the pack, with a presale success story, CoinMarketCap listing, and viral marketing that could catapult it into meme coin royalty. Meanwhile, Brett, Dogwifhat, Pudgy Penguins, and Snek each bring unique strengths and the potential for 4500% returns as we enter what could be a historic meme bull cycle. Don’t miss out—explore the Little Pepe presale today and join the biggest meme revolution of the year .

2025-08-04 19:21:06,49539038,1754335266,"Dogecoin Price Might Hit $1, But This Lower-Priced DOGE Alternative Offers Much Better Risk–Reward in 2025","As meme coins regain market traction, many investors are eyeing Dogecoin (DOGE) to revisit its all-time high and soar past $1. But while DOGE’s nostalgic appeal still burns bright, a new contender— Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —is quickly emerging as the meme coin with the most compelling upside and strongest fundamentals. Backed by its own Layer-2 chain and now ranked on CoinMarketCap, LILPEPE’s momentum is attracting bullish investors seeking exponential gains at a fraction of DOGE’s price. Dogecoin (DOGE): Can it Still Hit $1 Without Elon Musk’s Momentum? Dogecoin is trading around $0.24–$0.25, marking a modest rebound after dipping from the mid‑$0.28 range earlier this month. DOGE gained roughly 1.8% in the past 24 hours, buoyed by renewed trader interest and increased volume. Analysts are closely monitoring the $0.24 support level, a zone DOGE has revisited multiple times this cycle. A retreat could send DOGE toward the $0.19 to $0.21 area if that level fails. DOGE/USD 1D Price Chart|Source: TradingView Technically, a double-bottom reversal pattern is taking shape. A clean breakout above $0.28 could trigger upside targets of $0.42 to $0.52 in the coming weeks. However, despite strong inflows, DOGE faces stiff resistance in the $0.241 to $0.244 range and has failed several breakout attempts this week. There’s a sliver of renewed institutional interest. Rumors surrounding a potential Dogecoin ETF and accumulating positions by whale wallets have sparked optimism. $1 seems likely in the coming months, especially if meme mania returns, giving DOGE a strong push above $0.244. Yet, DOGE’s fate is still heavily tied to Elon Musk’s influence, which appears to be waning. With Musk reducing involvement in DOGE’s namesake government initiative and related memetic campaigns, the emotional driver behind the coin’s rallies may be losing power. Ultimately, while a climb to $1 is not out of the question, DOGE’s upside now seems capped unless a major narrative shift occurs. And that’s where newer meme coins like LILPEPE come in—offering not just hype, but also novel tech and early-stage entry points. Meet Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Balancing Risk with Utility Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —the viral new meme coin priced at just $0.0018 in presale and already turning heads across crypto Twitter and Telegram. Unlike DOGE, which hasn’t evolved much since its inception, Little Pepe combines everything the next generation of meme investors are looking for: A Layer 2 blockchain purpose-built for meme trading Ultra-low fees and high-speed transactions Anti-sniper bot protection for fairer launches Zero-tax trading to keep things simple and profitable A dedicated meme launchpad to attract a whole ecosystem of meme coins This is not just another meme token slapped together on Ethereum or BNB Chain. LILPEPE is a full ecosystem, powered by a proprietary Layer 2 solution that brings real technical value to the meme coin space—something DOGE still lacks. In fact, Little Pepe is solving some of the biggest pain points that have plagued the meme space for years. This includes gas wars, centralized insider launches, and the constant threat of bots front-running real buyers. Early Momentum: Stage 8 Almost Sold Out, CEX Listings Locked In Investors are already taking notice. Stage 8 of the presale has just sold out, with $13,775,000 raised so far. The current token price is $0.0018 in Stage 9. That means the clock is ticking for investors looking to get in early. Even more bullish? Two top-tier centralized exchange (CEX) listings are already locked in, with another deal reportedly in the works with one of the world’s largest CEXs. This ensures that Little Pepe will launch with real liquidity and serious visibility. No waiting around for volume or hoping for attention. LILPEPE has also been officially listed on CoinMarketCap, signaling credibility and sparking a new wave of investor awareness. Listings like these often precede major hype cycles, and with presale demand so strong, the setup looks eerily similar to other 50x–100x launches. Why LILPEPE Is the Better Pick Than DOGE Although DOGE remains the OG meme coin, several factors suggest LILPEPE is a better choice in 2025: Smaller market cap and early‑phase growth: DOGE’s large cap limits upside, while LILPEPE still trades with room to grow 50×–100× without hitting macro ceilings. Built infrastructure vs. hype play: DOGE depends on nostalgic appeal and influencer sentiment. On the other hand, LILPEPE begins with a dedicated chain and technical utility. Market visibility: Recent CoinMarketCap listing and confirmed Tier‑1 CEX listings at launch add credibility. Community momentum: The $777K giveaway and active engagement on Telegram, Discord, and X are building viral awareness well before public listing. Proven backers: Anonymous veterans behind major meme rallies support the project. This has added to its credibility. Final Verdict: DOGE Is Safe, But LILPEPE Offers Explosive Upside Dogecoin is a veteran with legacy meme value. If you’re looking for a steady ride and 3x to 6x returns in a bull market, DOGE might do the job. But if you're looking for real moon potential—the kind of risk–reward setup where a small investment could change your financial future—then Little Pepe is the coin to watch. With exchange listings, strong presale traction, and a Layer 2 meme infrastructure, LILPEPE is currently the most compelling DOGE alternative. The upside is massive, the narrative is hot, and the meme coin market is hungry for its next star.\ 👉 Join the Little Pepe presale before Stage 8 closes—and enter the $777K giveaway while you can.

2025-08-04 19:16:39,49538789,1754334999,"Top Online Casino Rankings: Spartans Beats FanDuel, Fanatics, and DraftKings With 300% Bonus and Crypto Payouts","FanDuel, Fanatics, and DraftKings have long been top names in the U.S. online casino space. Each has a unique edge. FanDuel is known for its clean design, Fanatics for smooth mobile play, and DraftKings for wide game options. While these platforms cover common needs, one name is getting attention for doing more with fewer limits. Spartans, a crypto-friendly online casino and sportsbook, is not trying to copy the old leaders. It is gaining players by offering what many now expect: big welcome deals, clear rules, fast crypto payouts, and a large game library that works well on mobile. With no region blocks and even a Lamborghini prize offer live now, Spartans is not just a crypto option. It is competing strongly with every top online casino app. Let’s look at how FanDuel, Fanatics, and DraftKings compare and why Spartans is now ahead. Spartans Focuses on Speed, Crypto, and Simplicity Spartans is more than just another crypto gaming site . It’s a full-featured platform that gives users faster access, simple rules, and more control. The welcome offer is a 300% bonus that all users can claim, with no hidden changes or area-based limits. Players face a 35x playthrough, a 7-day window, and clear rules for withdrawals. No matter the region or method used, the experience stays the same. Spartans gives users the chance to play a wide range of games, from slots and blackjack to roulette and esports betting. It includes both a casino and sportsbook in one clean mobile setup. Users don’t need to switch between apps or open new tabs to place bets or view odds. Fast crypto withdrawals are a key difference. Spartans lets players take out funds in BTC, ETH, or USDT, often within minutes. That’s a major plus when compared with others like FanDuel or top online casino names like DraftKings, where cashouts through banks or cards take much longer. Spartans also lists return-to-player stats and offers games with fair proof, making the whole experience open and reliable. FanDuel Casino: Smooth App, Limited Payment Options FanDuel’s casino scores well for its design. It runs in five U.S. states with an app that loads fast and is easy to use. The welcome deal gives new users 500 bonus spins and a $40 casino credit after a $10 deposit, with no promo code needed. But it falls short in flexible payments and crypto access. It doesn’t support crypto payouts, and those outside legal states must use sweepstakes apps. While FanDuel is strong in sports betting, its casino feels more like an extra than a main focus. Game options are fine but not as wide as newer names. For those in supported states, FanDuel works well. But high-volume or crypto players may find better speed and access with Spartans, especially among top online casino platforms. Fanatics Casino: Fast, Smart UI, Lacks Crypto Speed Fanatics Casino is built for mobile. The app learns what users like and adjusts game picks to make things simple. The bonus gives back up to $1,000 in credits over 10 days, with just 1x playthrough. It runs in Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Still, the site is growing. Its game list is smaller than bigger names, and while the bonus is decent, it’s not very flexible. Payout times depend on the method used, and there is no crypto option. For mobile users who want a clean design, Fanatics works. But without quicker payment tools or stronger promos, it still lags behind Spartans in full value, especially when comparing top online casino features. DraftKings Offers More Games but Slower Features DraftKings stands out with one of the largest game collections, especially in slots and live dealer sections. New users can get up to $1,000 in credits and 500 spins on a selected game, with rewards spread over 10 days. The app is packed with features and works smoothly on iOS and Android. But there are weak points. DraftKings does not allow crypto withdrawals, and some players mention unclear rules around promo offers. The casino may be one of the biggest in the U.S., but being large isn’t enough for users who expect quick payouts, fair odds, and clear terms. When lined up next to Spartans, DraftKings looks built for users who don’t mind waiting. That may fit older payment styles, but crypto players want more speed and fairness. In today’s market, even a top online casino like DraftKings must improve to keep pace. Final Thoughts FanDuel, Fanatics, and DraftKings may have name power, but they still use older systems. They limit payment types, change promos based on region, and often delay withdrawals. These setups suit long-time users but not the new crowd looking for faster, clearer, and more direct access. Spartans takes a different path. Its 300% bonus is easy to understand and open to all. Payouts in BTC, ETH, and USDT are fast. The platform has 5,963 games, live dealer tables, a full sportsbook, and esports betting, all built into one mobile-ready app. In 2025, users expect more from a top online casino . Spartans meets those needs, while others fall behind. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This milestone occurred for the first time on July 27, according to The Block. At that time, Base added 54,341 new coins, while Solana added 25,460. Over the past month, the number of daily launches on the Base second-layer network grew from 6,649 to over 50,000. The main driver of this growth was the integration of decentralized networks Zora and Farcaster into the Base App. Zora turns each Farcaster post into an ERC-20 token with liquidity on Uniswap. Authors receive 1% of trading fees in ZORA. Farcaster, the Web3 social network, increases user engagement by distributing tokenized content. As of August 2, Zora accounted for 64.6% of the total launches on the Base and Solana networks. On that day, Zora created 39,778 new coins, while Pump.fun and LetsBonk created only 15,132. Activity on Solana has decreased Trading activity on leading platforms in the Solana ecosystem has been declining since early August. Pump.fun had 346,000 users trading in July, with a volume of $337 million. By the time of writing, these figures had dropped to 129,000 users and $150 million, respectively. The LetsBonk platform showed similar dynamics. The number of active traders increased from 208,000 to 260,000, while the trading volume fell from $518 million to $242 million. According to DeFi Llama, Pump.fun also saw revenue decline. The platform's revenue in July was $24.96 million, down 80% from its January peak of $130 million. This decline in activity is due to a downturn in the overall meme coin market. According to CoinMarketCap, its capitalization has declined by 15% in the last week alone, to $70.8 billion.

2025-08-04 19:09:03,49573885,1754334543,"CleanSpark: Execution Over Hype, The Bullish Case Heading Into Earnings","Summary I rate CleanSpark a Strong Buy with a $15 price target, projecting 40%–60% upside in the next 12 months. CleanSpark stands out for disciplined, dilution-free growth, low mining costs, and a large self-mined BTC treasury, offering downside protection. Upcoming earnings should benefit from new FASB rules and BTC price surge, potentially crushing analyst estimates and catalyzing a turnaround. Key risks include Bitcoin price volatility, regulatory changes, and operational disruptions, but CLSK's fundamentals and management inspire confidence. CleanSpark (CLSK) is a US-based company operating in the Bitcoin mining landscape. It owns and manages a portfolio of mining facilities powered by globally competitive energy prices. CleanSpark is attributed to the speculative industry, but it is different from its peers. Unlike many of its competitors, the American bitcoin miner has a track record of consistent hashrate expansion; management avoids debt-fueled growth and focuses on disciplined business execution and long-term shareholder value instead of following hype-driven narratives. The company is expected to disclose its quarterly earnings on August 7th . Historically, CleanSpark lacked a consistent demonstration to deliver and outperform Wall Street forecasts. However, its business performance is highly dependent on Bitcoin price, but with a recent surge and closing price of approximately $108,000 for the quarter reported ending June 30th and with new FASB accounting rules in place, CLSK should post strong results on the quarterly meeting, way above analysts' estimates. I believe that CleanSpark offers an incredible 12- to 18-month short-term opportunity for investors to benefit from a potential 40% to 60% upside. As advised, it is truly one of the few crypto plays that provides a shareholder-friendly approach and turns from a complete growth to an earnings and free cash flow story while also maintaining HODL strategy with 12.608 BTC in its treasury, all self-mined. Equity dilution is one of the key risks for investing in the bitcoin mining landscape, but in its Q2 2025 earnings call on May 8, CleanSpark's management reaffirmed that its capital strategy will be focused on growth without diluting its investors via equity offerings. I rate CLSK as a Strong Buy with a $15 price target for the following 12-month period (44% upside from Friday's closing price of $10.44 as of August 1st). This stock price target assumes EPS of $1.50 to $1.80 for FY2025 and a slower growth of $1.90 to $2.10 for FY2026, leaving a margin of safety, while BTC price should stay conservatively above $108,000. Pricing in any possible uncertainty and investors skepticism towards this speculative industry of Bitcoin mining, to reach the projected price target we are applying 60% lower (~10x) than the current Russell 2000 small cap index forward multiple of 25x, and 30% lower than its historical 5-year average of approximate 15.4x, while in the meantime taking into account EPS at the lower point of $1.50 for FY2025. CleanSpark’s Q2 2025: Double Beat Expected, But Will It Be Enough? When considering an opportunity within a speculative and high-risk landscape, I feel more confident by approaching investment with conservative measures. I expect CleanSpark to disclose a double beat on the expected revenue, but considering the recent stock performance, I am worried this might not be enough. Based on Seeking Alpha analysts' projections, the EPS GAAP estimate for Q3 2025 is $0.50 and approximately $200 million in quarterly revenue. Expected EPS and Revenue estimates for Q3, 2025 (Seeking Alpha) On a monthly basis, CLSK provides shareholders with mining updates. Please find the production data for the relevant three quarters: April Bitcoin production: 633 BTC May Bitcoin production: 694 BTC June Bitcoin production: 685 BTC For Q3 2025, I expect the company to report a total of 2,012 mined BTC. FASB accounting principle requires companies to account Bitcoin price at the fair value at the end of the quarter for their profit and loss calculations, and cryptocurrency closed right below the $108,000 mark. Taking the above into consideration and assuming CLSK mined 2,012 BTC for the quarter, we should end up with a revenue projection of $217 million (2,012 x $108,000) for the quarter, around 9% higher than expected estimates. Now with the earnings per share calculations, we face a couple of uncertainties and have to rely on the figures provided on the Q2 report. The company has announced to its shareholders that the cost to mine one BTC was around $43,000 while additional operating costs per single coin were approximately $19,000 on a higher end. Let's assume 2% higher costs for more accurate and more conservative calculations: the cost to mine one BTC is $43,860 and other operational costs are $19,380, for a total of $63,240. Accordingly, gross profit per BTC should be around $44,760 ($108,000 - $63,240), which at total production of 2,012 BTC puts us around $90 million in total gross profit. Considering shares outstanding of 281 million, we could expect the Q3 2025 EPS to come around $0.32 ($90 million / 281 million) based on our calculations. Based solely on the above, we would be a third below the estimates, but this is where the benefits of FASB principles kick in. On the most recent Bitcoin mining report, CLSK disclosed it holds 12,608 BTC under their treasury, including June production figures. To calculate the benefit of appreciation of Bitcoin for the quarter, we should exclude 2,012 coins from this total holding, meaning the take-home figure is 10,596 Bitcoin. The Bitcoin fair value (aka closing price from a reliable source used for accounting) for the previous quarter-end (March 31st) was around $82,000 , which suggests an unrealized gain per BTC of $26,000 ($108,000 - $82,000). HODL strategy should help CLSK recognize an additional $390 million in net income under this new fair value accounting rule. 10,596 BTC HODL x $26,000 = $276 million (total unrealized gain) This should help the bottom line significantly, adding $0.98 EPS for the quarter ($276 million / 281 million total float) as non-cash gain. According to our estimates, a combined EPS of the following two is $0.98 + $0.32 = $1.30 for the quarter, identifying 2.5x larger EPS for the quarter than projected analyst estimates. It is important to mention that the above-stated EPS figure doesn't account for tax, depreciation, or other potential corporate costs; therefore, I would conservatively expect CLSK to disclose a bottom-line in the range of $1.10 to $1.20 for the quarter, which would still crush market expectations. Despite the actual figures, I expect management to reaffirm no equity dilution strategy, and I look forward to their statements around growth trajectory updates for the next 12-month period. Valuation: Volatility And Discounted Multiples It is quite challenging to consider CleanSpark as an investment solely on standard ratios like a P/E, considering the volatile landscape bitcoin miner is operating in. As it is so dependent on the Bitcoin price, which can significantly deviate on a month-to-month basis, this is known to be a high-risk industry exposed to the ruthless downside swings while also offering an extreme upside opportunity if bought at undervalued levels. This is why I tend to analyze and consider CleanSpark as an investment only in short-term sprints, as the underlying asset carries many risks and uncertainties, and being highly dependent on it as a business in general is difficult for any company in this industry. However, following the sentiment, volatile trends and timing entry points at undervalued levels could reveal a significant upside opportunity for pro-crypto investors. Based on the above-stated calculations and extremely poor pre-earnings 5-day stock price performance (-13.68%), which are approaching oversold levels, the setup seems attractive. CleanSpark 5-day Stock Chart (Seeking Alpha) CleanSpark's previous quarterly reports have been a mixed bag. For the first six months of FY2025, CLSK accounted for an aggregated $0.34 in EPS and $344 million in revenue with a CAGR of 90% on a QoQ basis at the midpoint. Investors experienced rollercoaster rides in both stock price performance and reported earnings. Earnings history, CleanSpark (Seeking Alpha) Nevertheless, if we would account for our projected EPS for Q3 2025 with 6-month bottom-line figures, we should end up at approx. $1.49 EPS for the first nine months of the year ($1.15 at the midpoint + $0.34 aggregated 6-month). It should put the P/E at 7x at the $10.44 close price without the last 3 months of the year with consecutive execution and gradually increasing monthly BTC production. At our estimates and projections for FY2026 with only conservative 10% growth, at the midpoint of $1.82 EPS brings a forward P/E of 5.7x, which is approx. 3x lower than the average forward P/E of a small cap index Russell 2000 company. The table below is for a better visual experience, assuming a closing price of $10.44 for CLSK stock. 9-month EPS (2025) Approx. 10% Growth EPS (2026) Q1 $0.83 $0.94 Q2 ($0.49) ($0.39) Q3 $1.15 (expected) $1.27 (10% delta) Total: $1.49 $1.82 P/E: $10.44 / $1.84 = 7 (ttm) $10.44 / $1.82 = 5.7 (frwd) CleanSpark Is Built To Withstand Even 30% Drop In Bitcoin Price CleanSpark's business model allows to mine BTC at relatively low costs, so it helps to create a shareholder-friendly and dilution-free growth strategy. This is the only sustainable way of doing business, as BTC could face a 30% decline from the current price, and CLSK would still mine on a break-even basis. It is an exceptional trait of CleanSpark, considering the company applies HODL strategy as well. Among mining companies, it is currently in the 3rd position worldwide in terms of BTC treasury on their balance sheets. Mining Companies HODL (BTC) ( Bitbo ) It is highly important to mention that for consistent growth of both the top-line and bottom-line, CLSK doesn't need Bitcoin to appreciate in price immediately. Even if the price trades around $108,000, which is a 6% downside from the current price, for the next few years until the following halving, CleanSpark would be able to grow its hashrate and keep up with revenue and earnings projections. It is understandable that the bitcoin mining landscape frightens investors due to high volatility and sudden changes in the price of the underlying, but in the current environment among the industry peers, I do not see a candidate to withstand sharp movements better than CleanSpark. Operational efficiency, sustainable Bitcoin accumulation, and predictable and consecutively executing management make it a leader in the digital asset operating field. Brutal Underperformance Of The Broader Market - Time For An Upside Leg Up? CleanSpark has been the worst in terms of the stock price performance compared to the closest peers. On a 1-year basis, CLSK is down 22.55%. Market undervaluation has been strong, despite improving fundamentals. CleanSpark Stock Price Performance Compared to Peers (Google Finance) Both MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) have a larger HODL under their BTC treasury, while Cipher Mining (CIFR) has been performing better even with only a tiny portion of Bitcoin under their balance, but under the spotlight of the AI craze and data center adoption. Nevertheless, in its recent Q2 2025 report, Riot Platforms announced its direct cost to mine per BTC was almost $49,000 , which is more than 15% higher than what CLSK discloses. It gives a longer-term advantage and limited downside protection against downward trends for the company. According to the Seeking Alpha provided valuation data, key metrics for CleanSpark are quite similar to its peers, so they shouldn't be performing at a premium, especially considering the Price to Cash Flow, which looks significantly better on a forward basis. Metrics CleanSpark Mara Holdings Riot Platforms Price to Book (FRWD) 1.62 (A grade) 1.15 (A grade) 0.83 (A+ grade) Price to Cash Flow (FRWD) 2.71 (A+ grade) 12.11 (B+ grade) 26.89 (C grade) This high-risk and high-reward play could be maturing for a turnaround swing. Despite vast underperformance compared to the benchmark, data reviewed suggests CleanSpark could be positioning itself for a leg up and hopefully Q3 earnings and the conference call will be a near-term catalyst. With CapEx spending stabilizing and BTC revenue scaling in, free cash flow could reach 4% to 6% by FY2026. What Could Go Wrong: Short-Term Concerns and Risks While the near-term fundamental results and outlook look promising, we should consider potential short-term concerns that stand out: Strategy playbook: CLSK is one of a few bitcoin miners that are not following the narrative-driven Michael Saylor strategy, which is raising capital through bond issuance. It has two sides of the coin: while shareholders should appreciate CleanSpark's acquisition of BTC by mining at significantly lower cost than the average price, the stock market is driven by sentiment, and companies following Saylor's playbook seem to be rewarded. Bitcoin price volatility: As was indicated, mining business is highly dependent on BTC price movements. In case of a sharp decline in Bitcoin price (for instance, below total costs to produce BTC and maintain business), mining margins would be severely pressured and investor sentiment would collapse. Disruptions in operational activity: Emerging energy costs or heatwaves could largely affect mining uptime and/or profitability. We should also take into consideration any potential short-term risks and potential challenges that could make a significant impact on CLSK stock price performance for a more balanced perspective: Changes in regulation: Despite the fact US administration has never been so pro-crypto, new regulations in place could bring uncertainty (for instance, tax proposals, changes in the energy industry), which could drastically impact operations. Bitcoin trading in range: Cryptocurrency trading in a small range for a longer period of time could cause frustration between investors and drag sentiment down, together with CleanSpark price, even if it would stay profitable. Dilution concerns: If on the following earnings call, management wouldn't reaffirm shareholders on no equity dilution policy to achieve its goals or raise some concerns related to expansion, a surprise would definitely raise a red flag. Conclusion: CleanSpark is a Strong Buy Despite the recent underperformance of the stock, CLSK is known to have a significant upside rallies. In my view, analysts estimates presented above are undervaluing the benefits of FASB rules and consecutive execution of CleanSpark management. Even with BTC trading at $113,000 for quite some time, bitcoin miners would be remarkably profitable, be able to grow both top and bottom lines, and with more favorable market conditions, could see a projected 40% to 60% surge in stock price in the next 12-month period. I rate CleanSpark stock a Strong Buy with a price target of $15. Speculative and high-risk landscapes require a more conservative approach towards expectations; therefore, my assumptions rely on a 10x forward multiple for a lower-end projection of a $1.50 EPS for FY2025, which would be beneath an average small cap stock and 3x lower than the average 5-year Russell 2000 forward P/E. It gives a margin of safety, and even though I expect better results, it's important to lower expectations, as there are short-term risks and concerns that could drastically affect projections. 12 analysts suggest a one-year average price of $19.80 , which defines a 98% growth for the stock. I am not that optimistic, considering the speculative nature of the industry, but I highly believe CleanSpark stock could see an upside of more than 40% and a stock price of $15 sooner than later. Historically, after a short-term pullback, it has also experienced a brutal turnaround; therefore, I hope the upcoming earnings could set it on the right path.",CLSK,EN,1,summary rate cleanspark

2025-08-04 19:07:04,49538792,1754334424,Verb Technology Bets Big on Toncoin with $558M Crypto Treasury Plan,"Verb Technology has announced plans to launch the first-ever publicly listed Toncoin (TON) treasury. Verb is betting its future on the growing influence of The Open Network with a bold $558 million fundraising plan. The company has joined the growing list of public companies that add digital assets to their balance sheet. As part of the move, the Verb is also rebranding itself. Rebranding to TON Strategy and Entering the Crypto Scene The Nasdaq-listed firm has revealed plans to completely reshape its business direction. As part of its shift toward blockchain finance, the company will soon rebrand to TON Strategy Co. This change reflects its full commitment to adopting Toncoin as its main treasury asset. Toncoin is the native token of The Open Network (TON), a blockchain ecosystem that is quickly gaining attention . This new direction is being developed in partnership with Kingsway Capital, a firm that has previously worked with the TON Foundation. Earlier reports revealed that Kingsway and the TON Foundation raised up to $400 million for a similar treasury initiative. Verb’s involvement appears to build on that earlier effort, pushing the total scale even further. Verb to Become First Public Toncoin Treasury Holder As part of the funding deal, Verb shared that it has entered into a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) transaction with accredited and institutional investors. The agreement includes the purchase of nearly 58.7 million shares of common stock at $9.51 each. This sale secures $558 million in gross proceeds for the company. The deal is expected to close on or around August 7, pending standard closing conditions. Once complete, the funds will be used to build a strong TON treasury. Also the company hopes to earn rewards through staking. This move will make Verb the first publicly traded company to use Toncoin as its primary reserve asset and one of the largest holders of Toncoin in the world. Verb’s Stock Jumps After News, But TON Price Drops The stock market reacted fast. After the TON treasury news, Verb’s share price shot up by as much as 100%. Although the price later pulled back, the stock still traded at around $15 in premarket, over 50% higher than its earlier levels. In the last month alone, the stock has climbed over 38%, with a 45% year-to-date gain. This sudden jump highlights a growing trend. Public companies that tie their future to cryptocurrency often receive a strong boost from the market. While Verb’s stock price gained, the price of Toncoin fell. Over the last 24 hours, TON has dropped by 7.5%, currently trading at $3.38, according to CoinMarketCap data. Some experts think the market may have already reacted to the news before it was officially announced. On August 2, TON rose by 7%, even though most other cryptocurrencies were losing value at the time.

2025-08-04 19:06:00,49538461,1754334360,Solana Price Prediction: Cup and Handle Pattern Confirmed – Final Dip Before $900 Target,"Solana (SOL) has been heavily hit by the latest downtrend and has shed 15.3% of its value in the past 7 days as the market has taken a necessary breather following July’s strong rally. Despite this latest downturn, analyst Ted Pillows, whose X account is followed by more than 190,000 users shared a bullish Solana price prediction that sees the token rising to $900 in the next few months after pulling back to $140. $SOL cup and handle pattern formation. Network activity is still strong, so I'm not writing off Solana in 2025. I think a dip towards $140-$150 before reversal is highly likely to happen. pic.twitter.com/UeCpANotXK — Ted (@TedPillows) August 2, 2025 Pillows emphasized that network activity is still strong within the Solana blockchain. On-chain data confirms this as monthly transactions in July exploded to a new 5-year record at 3.5 billion as per Artemis. This represents a 67% jump compared to July 2024 and a 17% increase compared to June this year. The growing popularity of meme coins like Bonk (BONK), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) have contributed to this remarkable surge. Canary Capital’s progress in getting an exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved for PENGU helped catalyze a strong rally across Solana-based meme coins . Finally, the launch of a Solana ETF by REX-Osprey that incorporated a staking feature also supports a bullish Solana price prediction as institutional and mainstream adoption could accelerate within the next few months. Solana Price Prediction: SOL’s Pullback Could Deepen Before The Next Leg Up Looking at SOL’s chart, we have seen a positive reaction in the price right after the $156 area was touched. This is an interesting reaction to a key trend line support that confirms its relevance for market participants. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently standing below the mid-line and near oversold levels. Combined with a trend line support bounce, this favors a bullish short-term Solana price prediction. All things considered, although a deeper drop could still occur, the token’s long-term prospects are quite promising amid this early indication of a bounce off this key line. While a move to $900 may seem ambitious at the moment, it’s not out of reach. If more SOL ETFs launch in the coming months, increased institutional exposure could push the price toward a new all-time high , and potentially much higher, by year-end. And as Solana gains momentum, several top crypto presales are also catching investor attention for their strong narratives and long-term potential. SUBBD stands out from other projects amid its ambitious value proposition – creating a better environment for influencers by leveraging the power of blockchain tech. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $1M to Launch its Powerful Content Platform SUBBD (SUBBD) is building a better home for content creators where they no longer suffer unfair bans, ambiguous moderation policies, and high platform fees.

2025-08-04 19:05:36,49538462,1754334336,XRP Comeback Incoming? Ripple CEO Resounds XRP Position Before SEC Case,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reignited discussions about XRP’s former glory, asserting that before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) got involved, XRP was the second most valuable digital asset, second only to Bitcoin. His remarks, shared in a short video by John Squire on X, emphasize the significant impact the SEC’s intervention had on XRP’s price, momentum, and market perception. SEC’s Role in XRP’s Decline In the video, Garlinghouse bluntly states, “What affects the price of XRP has been the SEC.” He explained that prior to the lawsuit, XRP was thriving, ranking directly behind Bitcoin and ahead of Ethereum in market capitalization. However, once the SEC filed suit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging XRP was an unregistered security, everything changed. XRP COMEBACK INCOMING… “Before SEC, #XRP was #2 in digital assets!” — Brad Garlinghouse @bgarlinghouse The case is ending. When it does, XRP will rise again! pic.twitter.com/Wxs5QdgU6d — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 3, 2025 The case created fear and uncertainty, leading to XRP’s delisting from major exchanges and a drastic decline in investor confidence. “They sued Ripple and XRP went down,” Garlinghouse remarked, expressing frustration that U.S. regulators appeared to pick winners and losers, distorting a free and fair market. He added that this is not how government should function, and that instead of creating a level playing field, the SEC’s actions stifled innovation and penalized a project with legitimate global use cases. Lawsuit Nearing Conclusion Garlinghouse’s renewed comments come at a critical moment. The Ripple vs. SEC case—arguably the most high-profile crypto lawsuit to date—is now in its final chapter. Ripple has formally dropped its counter-appeal , and the SEC is widely expected to follow suit. This resolution follows Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling, which declared XRP sales on public exchanges to be legal, though institutional sales did violate securities law. The ruling was a partial win for Ripple and set a powerful precedent in the industry. With the case now winding down, attention is turning toward XRP’s next move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Rebounds as Sentiment Shifts Following recent legal developments, XRP has shown signs of revival. After Ripple announced the case’s end, XRP surged over 8%, jumping from $2.30 to $2.49 in a matter of hours. Market watchers attribute the rally to renewed optimism and increased confidence from institutional players and retail investors alike. While XRP still trades below its all-time high of $3.84, this recent price action signals growing momentum. Large volumes have returned to the market, and on-chain data suggests long-term holders are accumulating again, hopeful that a regulatory overhang that has lasted nearly five years is finally behind them. A Comeback on the Horizon? Garlinghouse concluded the video with hope and conviction, stating that while the journey has been frustrating for the XRP community, he believes “in the long run we will prevail.” He praised the resilience of the “XRP family,” crediting their unwavering support during a turbulent legal battle. The combination of legal clarity, executive confidence, and renewed investor interest may indeed set the stage for a major XRP comeback . Whether it can reclaim its former position at the top of the crypto market remains to be seen—but for now, the path forward is clearer than it has been in years.

Despite this brief show of weakness, a crypto pundit forecasts that the leading altcoin may be on the brink of an explosive rally toward a new all-time high of $9,000. This bullish projection is based on the completion of a Broadening Wedge formation and an ongoing retest of the pattern’s upper boundary, which may now act as support. Ethereum Price Chart Signals Major Breakout According to the new technical analysis released by crypto market expert Gert van Lagen on X social media, Ethereum could be gearing up for a major breakout move, with price action potentially targeting upper bullish levels around $9,000. This report is based on a key chart pattern, the Descending Broadening Wedge, which has historically proven to be a powerful bullish continuation setup. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash: What’s Happening And Where ETH Is Headed Next On the weekly timeframe, Ethereum has completed a breakout above the upper resistance of the long-standing Descending Broadening Wedge pattern. After its initial breakout attempt, Lagen notes that Ethereum is now retesting the former resistance trendline, which has flipped into potential support. This retest is considered critical, with the analyst highlighting it as ETH’s second attempt to break higher while sustaining its bullish momentum. The technical setup, as outlined by Lagen’s price chart, shows a projected upside of 79% from the breakout point, which could send Ethereum soaring toward the $9,000 level. Lagen highlights that statistically, such patterns resolve upward 67% of the time, reinforcing ETH’s bullish outlook. The price zone also aligns with a historical sell line—an area where traders may begin taking profits as the cryptocurrency approaches upper targets. Interestingly, Lagen notes that the Bitcoin price has previously formed a similar Descending Broadening Wedge structure. At the time, the analyst had predicted that a successful retest of the pattern’s upper boundary could trigger a massive surge to $230,000 for Bitcoin. This historical parallel reinforces the belief that Ethereum could be on the verge of a similar upward trajectory if the current retest confirms support. Analyst Sees ETH Surpassing $5,000 This August Despite ETH’s brief pullback, August is shaping up to be a potentially explosive month for the leading altcoin. Market expert, ‘Crypto GEMs’ on X, predicts that Ethereum will break past $5,000 before the month is over. The analyst’s technical chart shows a strong bullish setup forming after Ethereum’s brief price correction. Related Reading: This Ethereum Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern Looks Similar To 2019-2020, Here’s What Happened Last Time Currently, ETH is trading around $3,554 following a steep drop from its July highs of around $3,900. While this decline may appear concerning to some, Crypto GEMs sees it as a golden buying opportunity. The analyst encourages traders to take advantage of lower prices and “buy the dip”, as ETH positions for its next potential leg up.

2025-08-04 19:00:22,49538163,1754334022,"No Fees, No Delays: Spartans Takes the Crown Over Stake and BC.Game as the Best Crypto Betting Platform","For crypto players, shifting between casino spins and sportsbook wagers often feels like unnecessary effort. You win in one section, but then you need to transfer your balance before backing your favorite team. Delays, confirmations, and unclear wallet divisions interrupt your momentum, and in some cases, make you miss out on fast-moving odds. That’s exactly where Spartans changes the game. Its unified wallet setup allows you to move from slots to sports bets instantly without switching balances. Whether you’re gearing up for the next bet or want to withdraw from casino earnings, Spartans keeps it simple. Split Wallets Are Slowing You Down Most crypto betting platforms keep casino and sportsbook balances separate. This means users must manually transfer funds, often facing delays, limits, or even small fees. If you enjoy quickly switching from a slot spin to a live bet, this structure breaks your rhythm. Trying to catch a live promo or place a fast bet during an event? Moving between wallets can cause you to miss out. Even worse, some platforms block withdrawals until funds are merged manually. These issues are exactly what Spartans avoids by default. Inside Spartans’ Unified Wallet Functionality With Spartans, you don’t have to switch balances internally. Once you deposit in BTC, ETH, USDT, or any supported crypto, your funds are instantly available across all parts of the site. Whether you’re at the slots, at the tables, placing bets on live sports, or exploring esports options, everything draws from the same wallet. A roulette win can immediately be followed by a sports parlay, all without clicking through extra steps. When you’re ready to withdraw from casino wins or sports bets, it’s just as direct. There’s no shifting of funds required. One Click to Switch from Games to Bets Jumping between games and live bets without moving wallets is a real advantage. Spartans’ interface supports this fluid experience. You can go from blackjack to a football match bet using the same account view, no internal cashier redirection needed. Your current crypto balance remains visible at all times, whether it came from table wins or sports payouts. There’s no confusion about what’s accessible, locked, or in limbo. For those who want full control without interruptions, this setup is ideal. No Hidden Fees or Platform Credits Many platforms use internal credits or special tokens that convert your crypto once deposited. This often creates confusion and sometimes results in lower value when converting back. Spartans avoids that completely.

2025-08-04 19:00:00,49538794,1754334000,Pudgy Penguins Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will PENGU Reach $1?,"Key Takeaways: Pudgy Penguins price prediction shows constant buying pressure around $0.035. Our PENGU price prediction expects a maximum of $0.0791 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the PENGU price to achieve $0.2. Pudgy Penguins is a set of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs that launched in July 2021 for about $90 each. It sold out quickly and gained attention, even appearing on the cover of the New York Times a month later. Within a few months, the cheapest penguin on the market was selling for over $6,000. However, prices dropped to around $1,000 in early 2022 as the NFT hype faded and issues arose within the community. Many were unhappy with the founder, Cole Villemain (aka ColeThereum), due to accusations of poor management. This led to a community vote to remove Cole. In January 2022, investor Luca Netz offered to buy the project for about $2.5 million. The deal went through a few months later. After Netz took over, the project’s value bounced back—floor prices doubled in just a few days. With new leadership and a fresh roadmap, Pudgy Penguins started rebuilding its reputation as a top NFT project. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Pudgy Penguins price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will Pengu reach $1?” and explore the factors behind PENGU token price prediction, providing insights into the role and utility of the PENGU token.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the PENGU price from an immediate surge. However, if the PENGU price successfully breaks above $0.04, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.047. PENGU/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, PENGU price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.03, resulting in a correction to $0.022. Is PENGU a good investment? Whether PENGU is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. The coin has support from the popular Pudgy Penguins brand, which has grown through NFTs, merchandise, and big deals like selling toys at Walmart—these could help increase interest in the coin. But the price is still very unpredictable and can change quickly. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the PENGU price up today? PENGU’s price gained strong buying pressure around recent lows, resulting in a strong surge. This created a push above $0.035. Will Pudgy Penguins price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.035 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will PENGU reach $0.2? Pengu price might reach the $0.2 mark in 2031 if buying demand surges and Pengu attracts altcoin investors. Will Pengu reach $1? The $1 mark is a distant dream for Pengu token. This price level is achievable in the long run if Pengu continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Pudgy Penguins a good long-term investment? Pengu token has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

On Monday, the company’s stock collapsed by 23%, sending its price tumbling from $122 on Friday to $94.50 by midday. The $27.50 drop crushed nearly all the gains it made after its explosive IPO debut just last Thursday. The sharp fall came just four days after Figma and its biggest shareholders sold 37 million shares at $33 each, raking in around $412 million for the company. The stock had opened with massive demand and more than tripled during its first trading session on the New York Stock Exchange, showing just how hungry investors were for high-growth tech names. But by Monday, that demand disappeared fast. Wall Street enthusiasm fades as economic warnings pile up While Figma told investors in its IPO filing that it expected second-quarter revenue to climb 40% year-over-year, and despite being consistently profitable, a rare trait among recent tech IPOs, that wasn’t enough to protect it from the broader market shakeup. Figma now carries a diluted valuation of about $56 billion, which is nearly three times what Adobe offered in 2022 to buy the company. That deal never closed. Regulators in both the U.K. and the European Union objected, and the companies officially canceled the agreement in late 2023. At today’s price, Figma’s CEO, Dylan Field, age 33, still controls shares worth more than $5 billion. While Figma was sinking, big-name analysts were sounding alarms. On Monday, strategists from Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Evercore ISI each warned of a potential pullback in the overall market. After a three-month rally that pushed the S&P 500 Index to new records, those same firms are now telling clients to prepare for drops. Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, predicted a 10% correction before the end of the quarter. He blamed pressure from tariffs and tighter corporate balance sheets, writing, “Over the last couple of weeks, we have noted that investors should expect a modest pullback in the third quarter.” At Evercore, Julian Emanuel gave an even sharper forecast, warning of a possible 15% slide. And Parag Thatte, who leads Deutsche Bank’s U.S. equity and global asset allocation team, said markets are overdue for a breather after surging nonstop for months. Weak data, seasonal trends, and rising fear hit equities Economic signals aren’t helping. Last week’s numbers showed an uptick in inflation, weaker job growth, and slower consumer spending. That added to the anxiety, especially heading into August and September, historically the worst-performing months for stocks. Over the past thirty years, those two months have averaged -0.7% returns, while the rest of the year tends to bring +1.1% gains. At the same time, stocks have gotten pricey. The S&P 500’s 14-day relative strength index surged to 76 last week, the highest since July 2024, just before the U.S. market peaked last summer. That number is way past the level of 70, which traders often use to flag overheated markets. Options traders are clearly uneasy. Contracts that hedge against a 10% drop in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) over the next 60 days are now much more expensive than contracts betting on gains. That spread hasn’t been this wide since the regional banking crisis in May 2023. Even with all the red flags, the broader market managed to bounce on Monday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 each rose by more than 1%, as traders gambled that the Federal Reserve might soon lower interest rates. Still, the mood remains cautious. Firms like Evercore and Deutsche Bank are urging clients to stay invested, but only in select areas. Julian Emanuel is still backing companies riding the AI boom, while Thatte pointed out that the market tends to see small 3% dips every two months, and bigger 5% drops every three to four months. Wilson, sticking to his stance, told clients, “We’re buyers of dips.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|FIG,EN,0,figma honeymoon wall street ended freefall mere day monday company stock collapsed sending price tumbling friday midday drop crushed nearly gain made explosive ipo debut last thursday sharp fall came four day figma biggest shareholder sold million share raking around million company stock opened massive demand tripled first trading session new york stock exchange showing hungry investor tech name monday demand disappeared fast wall street enthusiasm fade economic warning pile figma told investor ipo filing expected revenue climb despite consistently profitable rare trait among recent tech ipo enough protect broader market shakeup figma carry diluted valuation billion nearly three time adobe offered buy company deal never closed regulator european union objected company officially canceled agreement late today price figma ceo dylan field age still control share worth billion figma sinking analyst sounding alarm monday strategist morgan stanley deutsche bank evercore isi warned potential pullback overall market rally pushed p index new record firm telling client prepare drop mike wilson morgan stanley chief equity strategist predicted correction end quarter blamed pressure tariff tighter corporate balance sheet writing last couple week noted investor expect modest pullback third evercore julian emanuel gave even sharper forecast warning possible slide parag thatte lead deutsche bank equity global asset allocation team said market overdue breather surging nonstop month weak data seasonal trend rising fear hit equity economic signal helping last week number showed uptick inflation weaker job growth slower consumer spending added anxiety especially heading august september historically month stock past thirty year two month averaged return rest year tends bring gain time stock gotten pricey p relative strength index surged last week highest since july market peaked last summer number way past level trader often use flag overheated market option trader clearly uneasy contract hedge drop spdr p etf trust spy next day much expensive contract betting gain spread wide since regional banking crisis may even red flag broader market managed bounce monday p nasdaq rose trader gambled federal reserve might soon lower interest rate still mood remains cautious firm like evercore deutsche bank urging client stay invested select area julian emanuel still backing company riding ai boom thatte pointed market tends see small dip every two month bigger drop every three four month wilson sticking stance told client buyer key difference wire help crypto brand break dominate headline fast,0.147,0.722,0.13,-0.4226,0

This fast-growing AI-driven cryptocurrency has erupted with activity following its CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing, creating a whirlwind of hype comparable to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) historic rise. Already, Ruvi AI has sold over 210 million tokens, raised $2.7 million, and accumulated a community of 2,600+ holders in record time. Now sitting at 75% completion of Phase 2 in its presale, Ruvi AI has insiders and analysts alike predicting a meteoric rise in 2025, with many calling it a contender for Top Altcoin of the Year. The burning question is, could Ruvi AI truly eclipse its competitors and deliver equivalent or even greater success than prior altcoin sensations like Shiba Inu? CoinMarketCap listing fuels Ruvi AI’s explosion For crypto investors, being listed on CoinMarketCap is a power move that most projects can only hope to achieve. Reserved for serious, high-potential tokens, a CMC listing introduces a coin to a global community of crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors looking for new opportunities. Following its listing, Ruvi AI’s visibility skyrocketed, triggering intense demand during the presale phase. The result? An overwhelming slew of transactions that rapidly depleted token supplies. Numbers investors can’t ignore Ruvi AI’s post-listing growth has been nothing short of remarkable: $2.7 million raised from an eager pool of early investors.

2025-08-04 18:50:35,49538384,1754333435,Trump says he will raise tariffs on Indian exports over Modi’s oil trade with Russia,"President Donald Trump on Monday said he will “substantially” punish India in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s continued oil trade with Russia and refusal to cut ties with President Vladimir Putin. The message, posted on Truth Social, accused India of buying “massive amounts” of Russian crude and reselling much of it for a profit on the global market. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,” Trump wrote . “Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.” The post follows a 25% tariff Trump already announced last week on Indian exports, after trade negotiations between Washington and New Delhi broke down. The new tariffs landed without warning and stunned Indian officials, who had spent months trying to secure a deal. Trump’s latest threat arrives days before an August 8 deadline his administration has set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. If no truce is reached, the U.S. has warned of additional penalties, including secondary sanctions on countries still buying Russian energy. India is one of them. India ignores pressure, says oil trade will continue Modi and his cabinet aren’t backing away from the energy deals. Government officials have not instructed Indian refiners, state-run or private, to stop purchasing from Russia. No decision has been made to scale back, even after Trump’s latest warning. The buying decisions are being left to the refiners, who still prefer Russia’s discounted barrels. India started buying large amounts of Russian crude after the Ukraine war broke out in 2022. So far this year, the country has been importing around 1.7 million barrels a day, according to tanker-tracking data from Bloomberg. At the same time, India exported 1.4 million barrels of refined fuel daily in the first six months of the year. Diesel and gasoil made up about 40% of those exports, while gasoline and blendstock accounted for roughly 30%. Over the weekend, Modi addressed the trade war in a public rally in Uttar Pradesh. “The world economy is going through many apprehensions, there is an atmosphere of instability,” he said. The rally came just days after Trump’s 25% tariff announcement. India’s Ministry of External Affairs responded to Trump’s post the same day. “The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,” the ministry said on X. It also pointed to the U.S. and European Union still conducting trade with Russia even when it’s not a matter of “vital national compulsion.” They added that India’s energy purchases were made to keep domestic prices stable and ensure affordability for Indian consumers, calling it a “necessity compelled by global market situation.” Washington raises stakes as Modi defends Russia ties India has refused to shift its position on Russia. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday that the country’s foreign relationships stand on “their own merit” and shouldn’t be “seen from the prism of a third country.” He also defended the decades-old ties with Moscow, describing it as a “steady and time-tested partnership.” Asked if the friction with Washington would derail bilateral ties, Jaiswal said, “I’m confident that the relationship will continue to move forward.” The White House, on the other hand, continues to tighten the screws. Trump told reporters Sunday that special envoy Steve Witkoff would travel to Russia later this week for more discussions. That visit is expected to happen on Wednesday or Thursday. Meanwhile, tensions with Moscow keep building. Last week, Trump said he had moved two U.S. nuclear submarines in response to comments made by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who had issued what Trump called “highly provocative statements.” Back in India, the focus is shifting inward. Modi has pushed a renewed message of self-reliance and domestic consumption, tying it to his long-running “Make in India” campaign. He told the Uttar Pradesh crowd that protecting India’s farmers, small businesses, and youth employment is non-negotiable. His government is also refusing to open the country’s dairy and agricultural markets to U.S. companies, citing both religious and political sensitivities. Putin, for his part, isn’t moving either. The Kremlin has dismissed Trump’s pressure campaign, saying Russia’s military objectives in Ukraine remain the same. That only drives Trump crazier.

The initiative could test demand for low‑priced blockchain‑verified collectibles in mainstream consumer markets. Integration with Alibaba’s broader ecosystem may accelerate adoption across commerce and digital services. Ant Group’s digital asset platform Topnod has launched its “Online Digital Art Exhibition,” according to a Sina Technology News report published on August 4. Unlike the B2C model adopted by other digital art marketplaces, the platform allows creators to upload and sell their artworks once they have passed copyright review and declaration. Each purchase is recorded with a unique blockchain identification number, providing permanent ownership to the buyer. Pre‑Sale and Public Sale Model Topnod said the exhibition adopts a “pre‑sale + public sale” structure. During pre‑sale, user interest helps determine whether the artwork will be issued, the quantity minted, and its pricing. Public sales then proceed with finalized editions. The pricing model, typically ranging between 8 and 28 yuan (about 1–4 USD), is designed as a small “tip‑like” mechanism for users to support their preferred artists. Within three hours of launch, 4,088 pieces were reserved by users, according to the report. Artists, including painter Dai Dunbang and recent graduates of art academies, are among the first group of participants. The platform said it intends to help creators gain visibility while receiving market feedback to support ongoing work. Support for Digital Art Creators A Topnod program manager said the platform will allocate internal and external traffic resources to promote the exhibition and retail creator shops. It will also provide support to help artists attract and manage fans. Topnod also plans to develop a digital artist ecosystem to foster collaboration among creators and integrate online and offline engagement. Ant Group is an affiliate of Alibaba Group , best known for operating Alipay, and has been expanding its presence in blockchain through initiatives focused on digital finance and asset verification. Ant Group was excited to participate in WAIC 2025 in Shanghai, where we showcased our comprehensive advancements in AI technologies and products, including the AI healthcare manager AQ and a series of AI large models.

Topnod shows Ant Group’s ongoing strategy to integrate blockchain into consumer‑facing platforms, extending beyond payments into digital identity, data services, and now cultural content. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What role could blockchain play in intellectual property enforcement through Topnod? Unique blockchain IDs provide verifiable ownership records, potentially reducing counterfeit risks and strengthening copyright protection for digital artists. Could Topnod’s model influence global digital art markets? If successful, the model could encourage other markets to adopt blockchain‑verified collectibles with micro‑pricing to expand participation. What challenges might the platform face? Adoption could depend on demand, user trust, regulatory approval, and whether low‑cost digital art translates into sustainable income for creators.

The hacker then borrowed large amounts against the worthless collateral, draining approximately $2.64 million from the protocol’s lending pools. Attack Mirrors Previous Exchange Exploits Using Admin Compromise The CrediX exploit follows a pattern established by major crypto hacks, including the $234 million WazirX breach in July 2024 . Both attacks involved compromised administrative access that bypassed normal security measures through legitimate-appearing transactions from authorized accounts. Security analysis revealed that the attacker’s address 0xF321***662e held extensive privileges across CrediX’s infrastructure. The POOL_ADMIN, BRIDGE, ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN, EMERGENCY_ADMIN, and RISK_ADMIN roles provided comprehensive control over protocol operations and asset management. Today's @CrediX_fi hack is due to compromised admin account 0xF321683831Be16eeD74dfA58b02a37483cEC662e, which has a number of roles, including POOL_ADMIN, BRIDGE, ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN, EMERGENCY_ADMIN, and RISK_ADMIN. And the BRIDGE role is abused to drain/borrow pool assets… https://t.co/JGuLmh8zWu pic.twitter.com/0jmAuvtcJv — PeckShield Inc. (@peckshield) August 4, 2025 The bridge role abuse allowed direct minting of collateral tokens without backing assets, creating artificial value that supported massive borrowing positions. After draining the pools, most stolen funds were bridged back to the Ethereum mainnet with no subsequent movement detected by monitoring systems. CrediX immediately disabled its website to prevent additional user deposits while directing existing users to withdraw funds directly through smart contracts. The protocol had previously secured a $60 million credit line in 2023, making it a major player in institutional DeFi lending markets. The attack methodology resembles the WazirX hack, where malicious actors manipulated multisig wallet interfaces to trick authorized signers into approving compromised smart contract upgrades. Both incidents leveraged open vulnerabilities in known administrative access controls and multisig security implementations. Crypto Security Deteriorates Amid Rising Exploit Frequency The CrediX breach adds to crypto’s devastating 2025 security record, with July losses reaching $142 million across 17 major incidents , according to PeckShield data. July crypto hack losses surge 27% to $142 million with CoinDCX's $44 million insider breach and GMX's $42 million exploit leading victims. #July #CryptoHack https://t.co/4UCMKaxUvI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 The 27.2% increase from June’s $111.6 million reversed a temporary decline in hack-related losses. Major July exploits included Indian exchange CoinDCX losing $44.2 million through insider involvement and GMX protocol suffering $42 million in re-entrancy attacks. The CoinDCX incident involved employee Rahul Agarwal, whose compromised laptop provided hackers with system access after receiving malicious files from German contacts. Physical violence against crypto holders escalated alongside digital attacks, with 32 “wrench attacks” reported globally in 2025. For example, France experienced nearly one-third of incidents , including kidnapping attempts targeting crypto executives and their family members, with ransom demands reaching €7 million. Crypto investors also lost over $2.2 billion in 2025’s first half through 344 separate incidents, already exceeding all of 2024’s security losses. Wallet-related breaches accounted for $1.7 billion across 34 attacks, while phishing scams stole $410 million in 132 incidents. The WazirX exchange remains in legal proceedings following its 2024 hack, with Singapore’s High Court recently allowing creditor revoting on an amended restructuring plan . The court reversal provides hope for affected users who have been unable to access funds for nearly one year. Recovery efforts across all 2025 incidents have returned $187 million through law enforcement action, white-hat agreements, and exchange cooperation. However, net losses still total approximately $2.29 billion with an average incident loss of $7.1 million. For CrediX, the protocol has announced a full refund for all affected users within 24-48 hours, with a post-mortem report expected to be released after restoration.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous BTC analyst PlanB tells his 216,000 YouTube subscribers that while most market participants don’t expect BTC to reach $300,000 by the end of 2026, he does. “Now, 60% of people think that Bitcoin will not reach $300,000 by the end of 2026 – that’s this line, one and a half years from now. So, by the end of next year, this is the $300,000 point. Sixty percent of people think we’re not going to get there. In my opinion, we will. In fact, I think we’ll go a little higher, to the stock-to-flow target of $500,000 on average. That’s a very rough model, of course, based on scarcity and the stock-to-flow ratio. It has a range of $250,000 to $1 million, so the average could be $300,000 or $600,000. That’s all good, but at the very least, it will be higher than what most people think.” The stock-to-flow model is a predictive tool that assumes the scarcity of a commodity drives the price. While originally created to track traditional commodities, PlanB was the first to apply it to Bitcoin. The analyst is also watching Bitcoin’s realized price indicator, which looks at what price certain cohorts of coins were last transacted on-chain, divided by the number of bitcoins in circulation. Given that the price of BTC is above all the major cohorts, PlanB says there are no signs of a bear market to be seen. “Now, that’s classic bull market behavior, right? You can see that in all bull markets – the 2-year is above the realized, the 6-month is above the 2-year, and then Bitcoin, represented by the red dots, is above them all. So there’s no bear market warning signs whatsoever.” BTC is worth $115,043 at time of writing, up 1% on the day.

2025-08-04 18:40:43,49538456,1754332843,"4 best cryptos to buy today and hold until 2026 to make $1,000,000 from $2,000","With a new bull run approaching, investing $2,000 on breakout coins such as LILPEPE, TON, SEI, and DOGE can grow your investment by 2026. These projects load meme energy while being technologically advanced and swiftly adopted, making them favourable for great gains during the next wave of cryptocurrency. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Current price: $0.002 Potential by 2026: $1+ Little Pepe is a fast-rising meme coin that blends community-driven hype with real utility through its Layer-2 blockchain. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on market sentiment, LILPEPE is building its zero-tax, bot-resistant Layer-2 chain optimized for launching and trading meme coins. Its presale is nearly sold out, signalling strong early interest, and the team plans multiple CEX listings post-launch. What makes Little Pepe especially compelling is its massive upside potential from its extremely low price point. An increase to just $0.01 would mean a 5,000%+ gain! That’s a lot, no doubt, but a climb to $1 would mean a 500,000x return, turning $2,000 into a whopping $1 billion! Such crazy profits are extremely hard to come by, but even a sliver of that target would yield profits in the millions. Why hold until 2026? Little Pepe is in its early phase and has yet to hit major exchanges. As its ecosystem matures and its Layer-2 solution gains adoption, it could mirror the meteoric rise of Shiba Inu and PEPE, with utility to back it up. Toncoin (TON) Current Price: ~$3.30 Potential by 2026: $15–$25 Toncoin, the native token of The Open Network, is making serious strides toward mainstream adoption, especially after integrating a Toncoin wallet directly into Telegram for 87 million US users. This move positions TON as one of the few Layer-1 blockchains with a real-world communication app driving daily usage. The newly established $400 million institutional treasury is even more significant, created without a traditional fundraising round. Supported by Kingsway Capital and top US venture firms, this war chest is earmarked for ecosystem development, liquidity support, and new partnerships, signalling long-term confidence in TON’s success. Technically, Toncoin has reclaimed its key $3.00 level and is poised for a 20–21% short-term breakout to $3.70 or higher. In the long term, the combination of Telegram-based retail adoption and institutional backing makes Toncoin a strong contender for a $15–$25 valuation by 2026. Why hold until 2026? TON has the infrastructure, partnerships, and user base to become a leading innovative contract platform — especially if Telegram becomes the “WeChat of crypto.” With a solid foundation and real-world utility, Toncoin is one of today’s most undervalued large-cap plays. SEI (SEI Network) Current Price: ~$0.35 Potential by 2026: $5–$7 SEI Network is a speedy Layer-1 blockchain for DeFi, trading, and gaming. SEI’s smart consensus model and lightning-fast transaction finality make it different. These features let SEI take on high-frequency trading workloads that older chains struggle to handle. The current technical setup is bullish across multiple timeframes. SEI recently broke out of a long-standing trendline resistance, retested support successfully, and maintains momentum above $0.345. With rising volume and RSI in the low 60s, there’s room for a parabolic move if key resistance levels are flipped. SEI is targeting $0.45 in the short term, but its long-term upside is far greater. With a rapidly maturing ecosystem and increased adoption in DeFi and GameFi sectors, SEI could realistically achieve a $5–$7 valuation within the next cycle. Why hold until 2026? SEI’s technical underpinnings and specific use-case focus make it one of the most scalable and utility-rich chains in development. As DeFi regains momentum, chains like SEI that optimize for speed and efficiency will be in high demand. Dogecoin (DOGE) Current Price: ~$0.25 Potential by 2026: $1.50–$3.00 Dogecoin is the first-ever meme coin and one of the strongest assets still trading in the crypto world. Even though some people still think of it as a simple prank coin, DOGE has grown a considerable fan base, has actual ways people use it daily (like tipping and sending payments), and even sees heavy trading from big institutions. As of late July 2025, Dogecoin is back in a key accumulation zone ($0.15–$0.22) that historically precedes explosive rallies. Analysts like Ali Martinez and TradingShot indicate that DOGE mirrors its 2021 breakout structure. A run to $0.50 by September is feasible, and a $1.50–$3.00 price by 2026 isn’t out of the question if historical trends repeat. Whale accumulation is surging, with over 1.08 billion DOGE scooped up in 48 hours. This, combined with a breakout above a descending trendline and bullish momentum on multiple timeframes, suggests that DOGE’s next parabolic phase may be approaching. Why hold until 2026? DOGE has proven staying power, wide retail recognition, and institutional support. Should another meme-fueled rally take place, particularly with new altcoin adoption cycles, there’s no doubt that Dogecoin could surpass its previous all-time high (ATH). Bottom line: turning $2,000 into $1,000,000 Let’s break down a sample investment strategy to aim for that elusive $1 million target: $500 in Little Pepe @ $0.0018 → Potential 555,000 LILPEPE → If LILPEPE hits $1 = $555,000 $500 in Toncoin @ $3.30 → ~151 TON → If TON hits $25 = $3,775 $500 in SEI @ $0.35 → ~1,428 SEI → If SEI hits $7 = $10,000 $500 in Dogecoin @ $0.25 → 2,000 DOGE → If DOGE hits $3 = $6,000 Even conservative estimates suggest huge upside, but if even one of these coins makes a 100x+ move — especially Little Pepe — it could carry the portfolio to millionaire status.

2025-08-04 08:30:30,49514527,1754296230,Meme coin rout drives traders to DeFi as Pepe gains 8.2% with huge volume,"Decentralized finance is again gaining momentum, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become one of the most watched presale tokens in this sector. Pepe secures smart 8.2% gains Pepe (PEPE) surged 8.2% in 24 hours, reaching ~$0.00001132, capitalizing on meme coin momentum, per CoinGecko data. The rally, driven by a 28.5% trading volume spike to $961 million, follows Binance.US’s listing and removal of the “Seed Tag,” signaling reduced risk perception. On-chain data shows a whale withdrawing 2 trillion PEPE, boosting confidence, though a 13.91% weekly dip reflects volatility. Technical indicators, with an RSI at 60 and a cup-and-handle pattern, suggest a potential 25% climb to $0.000014, with resistance at $0.00001214. Despite lacking utility, PEPE’s 1,764% yearly gain and $4.75 billion market cap highlight strong community support. However, 48% of holders being short-term adds sell-off risk. Posts on X note PEPE’s breakout potential, but competition from newer meme coins like Little Pepe could cap gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike meme-driven plays, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built to operate with two core income layers built into its ecosystem: stablecoin lending through its P2C (Peer-to-Contract) pools and interest-accruing mtTokens. These features allow users to actually earn yield in real time, not just speculate on price. Here’s how it works: when users deposit assets such as AVAX into a P2C pool, they retain full exposure to their original token while generating APY that automatically compounds. For example, a $2,000 AVAX deposit into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending pools will earn 9.8% APY without needing to sell the asset. The return is fueled by borrowers who lock collateral to access funds from the same shared pool. Since lending rates are algorithmically adjusted based on pool utilization, the system remains self-regulating and capital-efficient. MUTM buybacks and stablecoin expansion signal next-gen DeFi Lenders aren’t the only ones earning yield. Once users receive mtTokens (like mtAVAX or mtUSDT) after depositing into the platform, they can stake these tokens into designated smart contracts. Staking mtTokens adds a second revenue layer: MUTM token rewards. These rewards aren’t arbitrarily minted—instead, they are purchased back from the open market using the protocol’s revenue, offering long-term sustainability and market support. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a third innovation lined up: a decentralized stablecoin that will enter circulation through overcollateralized loans. Minting will be pegged 1:1 to the USD and tied directly to asset-backed borrowing, while burning will occur on repayments. This system is designed to maintain a $1 peg without relying on centralized reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance is currently in Phase 1 of its roadmap, with most of the foundational tasks already completed. As it prepares to enter Phase 2—’Building’—the focus will shift toward core smart contract development, DApp front-end and back-end construction, and implementation of advanced features. These steps will pave the way for Phase 3—’ Finalizing’—which includes beta testing, security audits, and preparation for launch. The final Phase 4—’ Delivering’—will see the full mainnet deployment, token listings, and expanded platform features, completing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s vision of a comprehensive and secure DeFi ecosystem. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035, with 10% of the 170 million token allocation already sold and over 14,800 holders onboard. The presale has now raised more than $13.9 million. With the next phase priced at $0.040, a 15% jump is imminent, creating urgency for investors aiming to lock in a lower entry point before listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale stages have already rewarded early participants handsomely. Investors from Phase 1, who swapped assets like Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL) at just $0.01 per MUTM, are now sitting on 3x returns. With the listing price set at $0.06, Phase 6 buyers at $0.035 stand to gain over 70% upon launch, without factoring in any additional upside post-listing. $100K giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also secured a high-level security profile through its partnership with CertiK. The protocol boasts a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. In addition, a $50,000 bug bounty is currently live to further harden the codebase. Community traction is growing fast as well, with over 12,000 followers on Twitter and a $100,000 giveaway campaign currently active, where 10 lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. As retail euphoria in meme coins fades just as fast as it rises, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building to offer a compelling long-term value proposition. Meme coins offer moments. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers mechanisms. From algorithmic lending pools to mtToken staking, and from stablecoin minting to revenue-backed buybacks, the foundation is being laid for a serious DeFi player. While the meme crowd chases the next 8.2% candle, forward-looking traders are securing future yield, ecosystem utility, and pre-listing upside with MUTM.

2025-08-04 08:30:12,49513080,1754296212,Bitcoin Demand: Unwavering Strength Despite Market Turbulence,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Demand: Unwavering Strength Despite Market Turbulence Bitcoin demand continues to be a central topic in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Even as the market experiences its inevitable dips and surges, a fascinating narrative emerges from the data: the underlying appetite for Bitcoin remains robust. This resilience challenges conventional wisdom that price volatility always dampens investor interest. Instead, we are witnessing a powerful testament to long-term conviction among Bitcoin holders. Recent insights from CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost on X shed light on this compelling trend. His analysis suggests that despite recent price volatility, the foundational Bitcoin demand is not just holding steady, but actively growing. Understanding the metrics behind this phenomenon is crucial for anyone seeking to grasp the true dynamics of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Understanding Sustained Bitcoin Demand: What the Data Reveals When the market experiences turbulence, many expect a significant exodus of capital. However, for Bitcoin, the story appears different. Darkfost’s analysis points to substantial accumulation, indicating a persistent belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. This isn’t just anecdotal; it’s backed by specific on-chain metrics that paint a clear picture of strong underlying Bitcoin demand . Significant Accumulation: Over the past 30 days, approximately 160,000 BTC have been accumulated. This figure compares new Bitcoin issuance with supply held in long-term inactive wallets, suggesting active absorption by buyers. Steady Buying Pressure: The addition of 160,000 BTC in a short period, even during price fluctuations, indicates consistent buying pressure. Dips are viewed as opportunities for acquisition. Market Absorption: This accumulation demonstrates the market’s capacity to absorb significant amounts of Bitcoin without drastic price depreciation, indicating healthy liquidity for persistent Bitcoin demand . This sustained accumulation highlights a market where participants are positioning themselves for long-term growth, reflecting a maturing asset class where conviction outweighs transient volatility. Who is Fueling This Unwavering Bitcoin Demand? It’s not just about the quantity of Bitcoin being accumulated; it’s also about the nature of the wallets doing the accumulating. Darkfost’s analysis provides a granular look at the types of holders contributing to this robust Bitcoin demand , offering insights into their investment philosophies. One particularly insightful metric highlights wallets that have consistently accumulated Bitcoin without making any sales. These “hodlers” are individuals or entities committed to holding their Bitcoin for extended periods, regardless of market conditions. Their behavior is a powerful indicator of deep conviction. Dedicated Accumulators: During the same 30-day period, nearly 50,000 BTC were added by wallets that have only ever accumulated Bitcoin, never selling. This cohort represents the most steadfast segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Reflecting Strong Conviction: The activity of these “accumulation-only” wallets underscores a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Their continuous additions, even during price declines, signify a strategic approach focused on future appreciation. Foundation of Stability: These long-term holders form a crucial foundation for Bitcoin’s price stability. Their unwillingness to sell during downturns helps absorb selling pressure, providing a bedrock of Bitcoin demand . This trend suggests a significant portion of the market comprises sophisticated investors or individuals with high conviction in Bitcoin’s future. They are not easily swayed by short-term price swings, preferring to ride out volatility in anticipation of future gains. This investor behavior is critical for the long-term health and growth of any asset class. What Do OTC Desks Reveal About Long-Term Bitcoin Demand? Beyond on-chain wallet behavior, the activity of Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks offers another compelling piece of the puzzle regarding sustained Bitcoin demand . OTC desks facilitate large, private transactions between institutional buyers and sellers, often bypassing public exchanges. The amount of Bitcoin held by these desks indicates institutional and high-net-worth individual interest. A significant observation from Darkfost’s analysis is the sharp decline in the amount of Bitcoin held by OTC desks. This trend is highly indicative of strong long-term absorption by large players. Metric September 2021 Current Holdings Implication for Bitcoin Demand BTC held by OTC Desks ~550,000 BTC ~145,000 BTC Significant decline suggests strong absorption by institutional buyers. The dramatic reduction from approximately 550,000 BTC in September 2021 to around 145,000 BTC today is a powerful signal. This isn’t just Bitcoin moving from one wallet to another; it’s Bitcoin moving from a liquidity provider (OTC desk) into the hands of long-term holders, often institutions or high-net-worth individuals who intend to hold these assets for an extended period. Reduced Supply for Large Buyers: A lower balance on OTC desks means less available Bitcoin for large, private purchases. This scarcity can contribute to upward price pressure as institutional Bitcoin demand continues. Institutional Absorption: The decline suggests large entities are actively buying Bitcoin and moving it off these desks, presumably into cold storage. This reflects a strategic, rather than speculative, investment approach. Indicator of Maturing Market: The shift away from readily available OTC supply towards long-term holdings signifies a maturing market where significant capital is deployed with a long-term horizon, lending credibility to Bitcoin as a serious investment. The convergence of these data points – consistent accumulation by general holders, unwavering commitment from accumulation-only wallets, and the significant draw-down from OTC desks – paints a cohesive picture of remarkably strong and resilient Bitcoin demand , even amidst prevailing market uncertainties. Navigating Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s Underlying Strength While daily price movements often dominate headlines, a deeper dive into on-chain analytics reveals a more profound narrative about Bitcoin’s intrinsic strength. The consistent Bitcoin demand , as evidenced by the metrics discussed, suggests that volatility is increasingly viewed as a temporary state rather than a fundamental flaw. Understanding these underlying dynamics is essential for investors looking beyond short-term fluctuations: Benefits of Long-Term Perspective: Focusing on accumulation trends and long-term holding patterns provides a more stable outlook than reacting to every price swing. It highlights that a significant portion of the market is playing a long game. Challenges of Short-Term Noise: The primary challenge for investors is often filtering out the short-term noise and emotional reactions. The data from CryptoQuant reminds us that the fundamentals of Bitcoin demand remain robust, even when headlines suggest otherwise. Actionable Insights for Investors: These insights suggest that dips may represent opportunities for accumulation rather than reasons for divestment. It encourages a disciplined approach focused on long-term growth, aligning with the behavior of seasoned holders. The consistent absorption of newly issued Bitcoin and the depletion of OTC reserves underscore a growing scarcity effect, further reinforcing the long-term bullish case. As more Bitcoin moves into long-term holdings, the available supply on exchanges for immediate sale decreases, potentially leading to increased price pressure when Bitcoin demand surges. This dynamic creates a virtuous cycle: strong conviction leads to accumulation, which reduces available supply, potentially driving prices higher, which in turn can reinforce conviction. Bitcoin’s unique on-chain transparency allows us to observe these underlying forces of demand and supply in a way that is often impossible for traditional assets. In conclusion, the narrative around Bitcoin’s market performance is often simplified to price charts, but a deeper dive into on-chain data reveals a far more nuanced and encouraging story. The unwavering Bitcoin demand , evidenced by significant accumulation from steadfast holders and the notable depletion of OTC desk reserves, paints a picture of robust underlying strength. Despite the market’s inherent volatility, the consistent absorption of Bitcoin into long-term holdings underscores a powerful conviction among investors. This isn’t just about weathering storms; it’s about actively building positions, reflecting a profound belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition and its role in the future of finance. The data suggests that for a growing segment of the market, Bitcoin is not merely a speculative asset but a strategic, long-term investment, reinforcing its position as a resilient digital store of value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Bitcoin Demand 1. What does “Bitcoin demand” mean in the context of market drops? Even during market downturns, “Bitcoin demand” refers to the continued interest and willingness of investors to buy and hold Bitcoin. This is measured by metrics like accumulation rates, the behavior of long-term holders, and the supply held by institutional desks. 2. How is strong Bitcoin demand identified from on-chain data? Strong demand is identified through several on-chain indicators, including: a) Net accumulation of BTC (new issuance vs. long-term inactive supply), b) Wallets that consistently accumulate without selling, and c) Declining balances of BTC held by Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks, indicating large purchases moving off-market. 3. What are OTC desks, and why is their BTC balance important for Bitcoin demand analysis? OTC (Over-The-Counter) desks facilitate large, private Bitcoin transactions, often for institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. A sharp decline in BTC held by these desks suggests that large buyers are actively acquiring Bitcoin and moving it into long-term storage, indicating robust institutional Bitcoin demand . 4. Does strong Bitcoin demand guarantee price increases? While strong Bitcoin demand is a significant bullish indicator and often correlates with upward price pressure over the long term, it does not guarantee immediate price increases. Market prices are influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment. However, sustained demand provides a strong foundation for future growth. 5. How does investor conviction play a role in Bitcoin demand? Investor conviction refers to a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, leading investors to hold or accumulate assets even during periods of volatility. This conviction is crucial for sustained Bitcoin demand as it reduces selling pressure during dips and supports a healthier, more stable market over time.

2025-08-04 08:27:49,49513959,1754296069,Market sees this altcoin delivering 30x before BTC’s next surge,"A presale gem with a roadmap to triple-digit gains MUTM is currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. At this rate, a move to $1.05—its projected post-listing target based on platform growth forecasts, tokenomics, and Layer-2 deployment—would represent a 30x return. Unlike vague memecoins or tokens with no real use case, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building the foundation for a decentralized lending ecosystem powered by P2P and P2C mechanics. And that’s exactly why attention is shifting from established coins to this rising DeFi star. More than 14,800 holders have already joined the project, and 7% of the allocated 170 million tokens in this round have been sold. The clock is ticking toward a 15% price increase in Phase 7, which will move the token to $0.040. But for those buying in now, the upside remains unmatched. At the time of writing, the listing price is already locked at $0.06, giving new buyers a guaranteed gain just by entering early. Long-term projections remain even more explosive. A wallet that entered Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 1 with just $3,000 rotated from Chainlink (LINK) is now sitting on roughly $10,500 worth of tokens. And based on post-launch projections toward $1, that’s a full 30x return within sight. For investors looking to outperform the broader market, this is not a development to overlook. Lending utility sets the foundation for DeFi expansion One of the biggest growth catalysts behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its two-pronged lending approach. On the P2C side, lenders will deposit blue-chip assets like Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, or stablecoins into liquidity pools and earn high-yield passive returns. For instance, a user depositing $8,000 in MATIC will be able to earn 9.5% APY—equivalent to $760 annually—just by contributing to the ecosystem. Borrowers, meanwhile, will tap into the same pool by putting up collateral. With a 65% loan-to-value ratio, that AVAX deposit will enable another user to borrow $5,200 in USDC, unlocking capital without selling long-term holdings. P2P lending will also be part of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blueprint, allowing users to directly negotiate loan terms on more volatile or meme crypto assets like DOGE, TRUMP, FLOKI, and BONK. This model will introduce flexibility and customization, attracting a broader range of DeFi users and enabling yield strategies beyond conventional platforms. But this is just the beginning. The development team has announced plans to integrate the platform on a Layer-2 network at launch. This will significantly reduce gas fees and improve transaction speed, critical for scaling user adoption. Combined with the upcoming decentralized stablecoin that will be minted and burned against loan creation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is laying the groundwork for long-term demand and consistent utility. Community building To instill trust and enhance security, the project has partnered with CertiK for a comprehensive audit. The platform scored 95.00 in the Token Scan and achieved a Skynet rating of 78.00. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty campaign is underway, inviting ethical hackers to rigorously test the code for vulnerabilities. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway is being offered to early believers, with ten winners walking away with $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. With more than 12,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) and rising, the community is expanding by the hour. But access to the $0.035 price level won’t last much longer. The current phase is nearing sellout, and once it closes, Phase 7 will push the token to $0.040. That’s a 15% bump—instantly increasing the entry price for anyone who hesitates. For those still on the sidelines, this is a rare moment in the DeFi cycle: a live presale with a locked-in listing price, audited smart contracts, active incentives, and a clear roadmap that supports long-term valuation. As other assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum move sideways, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to step into the spotlight. There’s still time to get in early, but not much.

2025-08-04 08:25:11,49512943,1754295911,YGG Treasury Management: A Bold New Era for On-Chain Guilds,"BitcoinWorld YGG Treasury Management: A Bold New Era for On-Chain Guilds The world of decentralized finance and blockchain gaming is constantly evolving, with innovation driving new approaches to digital asset management. One of the most significant shifts we are witnessing is in YGG treasury management , as pioneering entities move from simply holding assets to actively cultivating them for sustainable growth. Yield Guild Games (YGG), a leading decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the GameFi space, has just announced a groundbreaking initiative that sets a new standard for on-chain asset stewardship. This strategic move signals a profound commitment to long-term ecosystem health and value creation, moving beyond traditional passive treasury approaches. What is YGG Treasury Management’s Bold New Approach? Yield Guild Games has publicly stated its decision to allocate a substantial 50 million YGG tokens, valued at approximately $7.5 million, to a dedicated on-chain ecosystem pool. This pool will be overseen by a newly established proprietary guild, marking a pivotal transition. The core idea is to transform YGG’s treasury from a static vault into a dynamic, actively managed fund. This initiative is designed with several clear objectives: Generating Returns: By actively managing assets, the guild aims to deploy capital in strategies that yield positive returns, increasing the overall value of the treasury. Improving Sustainability: Active management can create new revenue streams, reducing reliance on token issuance and enhancing the long-term financial viability of the YGG ecosystem. Supporting Ecosystem Strategy: The managed assets can be strategically deployed to fund new GameFi projects, support community initiatives, and foster innovation within the YGG network, directly aligning with the guild’s mission. This move reflects a growing maturity in the DAO landscape, where organizations are recognizing the need for sophisticated financial strategies to ensure longevity and impact. It’s not just about accumulating assets; it’s about making those assets work for the community. Why is Active YGG Treasury Management Crucial Now? In the volatile and rapidly changing cryptocurrency market, passive asset holding can expose organizations to significant risks. The bear market of recent years highlighted the vulnerabilities of treasuries that simply held tokens without active strategies for growth or risk mitigation. YGG’s decision to pivot to active YGG treasury management is a proactive response to these market realities and a forward-looking strategy for resilience. Consider the contrast between passive and active treasury approaches: Aspect Passive Treasury Management Active YGG Treasury Management Primary Goal Asset preservation Growth, sustainability, ecosystem support Risk Exposure High exposure to market downturns Mitigated through diversification, active strategies Return Potential Limited to asset appreciation Potential for consistent yield generation Resource Utilization Assets sit idle Assets are put to work This strategic shift demonstrates a commitment to operational excellence and financial prudence, ensuring that YGG remains at the forefront of the GameFi sector, capable of adapting to market dynamics and seizing new opportunities. How Will the On-Chain Guild Operate for YGG Treasury Management? The newly formed proprietary guild will be at the heart of this active YGG treasury management . While specific operational details are likely to evolve, the fundamental principles will revolve around transparency, accountability, and strategic deployment. Being an “on-chain” guild implies that many of its operations, decisions, and transactions will be recorded and verifiable on the blockchain, fostering a high degree of trust and visibility for the YGG community. Key operational aspects may include: Investment Mandate: The guild will operate under a clear mandate outlining permissible investment strategies, risk parameters, and return objectives. This could include yield farming, liquidity provision, staking, or even strategic investments in emerging GameFi projects. Expertise and Governance: The guild members are expected to possess significant expertise in decentralized finance, GameFi economics, and market analysis. Decisions might be subject to multi-signature approvals or even broader DAO governance mechanisms, ensuring community oversight. Performance Tracking: Regular reports on the guild’s performance, asset allocation, and generated returns will be crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability to the YGG token holders. This data-driven approach allows for continuous optimization of strategies. The on-chain nature of this guild is particularly significant. It moves beyond traditional corporate structures, embedding financial operations within a transparent, decentralized framework. This innovation could inspire other DAOs to adopt similar models, pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance. What Are the Benefits of This Strategic YGG Treasury Management? The implications of YGG’s new treasury strategy extend far beyond simple financial returns. This move has the potential to create a ripple effect of benefits across the entire YGG ecosystem and potentially the broader GameFi industry. Enhanced Financial Resilience: By actively generating returns, YGG can build a more robust treasury, better equipped to weather market downturns and fund long-term initiatives without diluting its token supply through constant new emissions. This creates a more stable economic foundation. Increased Value for YGG Token Holders: A growing and sustainably managed treasury can directly contribute to the intrinsic value of the YGG token. While not a direct price driver, a healthy treasury signals strong fundamentals and long-term viability, which can positively influence investor confidence. Accelerated Ecosystem Growth: The ability to deploy capital strategically means YGG can more effectively support new game development, invest in crucial infrastructure, and expand its global reach. This fuels innovation and brings more value to players and developers within the ecosystem. Pioneering Decentralized Financial Models: YGG is setting a precedent for how DAOs can manage their assets in a sophisticated and decentralized manner. This could lead to the development of best practices and new financial primitives for the entire Web3 space, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with on-chain governance and finance. Greater Autonomy and Self-Sufficiency: Reducing reliance on external funding rounds or constant token sales for operational expenses empowers YGG to become more self-sufficient. This autonomy allows for more agile decision-making and a stronger focus on community-driven initiatives. Are There Challenges to Active YGG Treasury Management? While the benefits are clear, active treasury management in a decentralized context is not without its challenges. YGG, like any pioneering organization, will need to navigate potential hurdles to ensure the success of this initiative. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Even with active management, significant market downturns can impact treasury value. The guild will need robust risk management strategies to mitigate these effects. Operational Complexity: Managing a multi-million dollar portfolio on-chain requires sophisticated tools, expert personnel, and continuous monitoring. The operational overhead can be substantial. Governance and Accountability: While transparency is built-in, ensuring effective governance and holding the proprietary guild accountable for its performance will be an ongoing task. Striking the right balance between autonomy for the guild and oversight from the broader DAO is crucial. Security Risks: On-chain operations always carry smart contract risks, potential for exploits, or other security vulnerabilities. Robust auditing and security measures will be paramount. Talent Acquisition: Finding and retaining top talent with expertise in both DeFi and GameFi, who are also aligned with decentralized principles, can be challenging. Addressing these challenges proactively through robust governance frameworks, continuous security audits, and a commitment to transparency will be key to the long-term success of this innovative YGG treasury management approach. What Does This Mean for the Future of GameFi and YGG? YGG’s move into active treasury management is more than just an internal financial decision; it’s a statement about the future direction of GameFi and decentralized organizations. It signals a shift towards greater financial sophistication and sustainability within the Web3 gaming ecosystem. For YGG itself, this strategy aims to solidify its position as a leader in the GameFi space, enabling it to better support its network of subDAOs, scholarship programs, and game partnerships. A stronger treasury means more resources to invest in the play-to-earn economy, benefiting players, developers, and the broader community. More broadly, this could set a new precedent for other DAOs. As the Web3 space matures, the ability to manage assets effectively will become a defining characteristic of successful decentralized organizations. YGG is demonstrating a viable path forward, showcasing how DAOs can evolve beyond simple token distribution to become financially resilient and strategically astute entities. The integration of financial expertise with community governance, all operating on-chain, represents a powerful model for the future of decentralized autonomous organizations. It underscores the potential for Web3 to build not just new applications, but entirely new forms of economic and organizational structures. In conclusion, Yield Guild Games’ launch of a $7.5 million on-chain guild for active treasury management is a monumental step. It reflects a mature understanding of decentralized finance, a proactive approach to market challenges, and a deep commitment to the long-term sustainability and growth of its ecosystem. This bold initiative is poised to generate returns, enhance financial resilience, and further solidify YGG’s pioneering role in the GameFi industry, setting a new benchmark for sophisticated DAO operations. The future of decentralized asset management is here, and YGG is leading the charge.

2025-08-04 08:20:58,49512738,1754295658,Binance makes Bitcoin options writing available to all users,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has opened Bitcoin ( BTC ) options writing access to all users, responding to increased retail demand for strategic trading tools, according to information communicated to Finbold on August 4. The expansion allows users to express market views, manage risk, earn premiums, and enhance yield through options writing strategies beyond traditional long or short positions. Bitcoin options trading volume has grown significantly, reaching $138.76 billion in June 2025 from $4.11 billion in 2020, a 3200% growth in five years. The increased access enables a broader user base to deploy sophisticated trading strategies using options alongside futures contracts for hedging and profit opportunities. “Users around the world utilize Binance’s derivatives products for liquidity and hedging at highly-competitive prices and our Bitcoin options products will meet the growing retail demand for more and better trading tools,” said Jeff Li, VP of Product at Binance. “As with traditional markets, accelerating crypto adoption will increase demand for more sophisticated liquidity tools and we are committed to building a fuller suite of derivative products to support our users.” Trading fees promotion and enhanced program To celebrate the launch, all users receive a 20% discount on Taker and Maker trading fees for newly listed Options contracts, including ETH , BNB , and SOL contracts. Binance has also improved its Options Enhanced Program for high-volume and institutional traders, offering better maker/taker fees, lower qualification thresholds, and longer grace periods for onboarding. Binance implements risk management controls requiring option writers to post margin as collateral for their obligations. Users must complete a mandatory suitability assessment to access Binance Options products. The BTC Options use USDT as both collateral and settlement asset, with a contract unit of 1 and strike intervals ranging from ±0.05 to ±0.95 delta. The platform offers daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly expiration options, all expiring at 08:00 UTC on their respective dates. Transaction fees are set at 0.03% with exercise fees at 0.015%.

2025-08-04 08:19:12,49513957,1754295552,"Analysts say MUTM could rally 1600% as ETH nears $3,800","Low market cap, high momentum—why analysts are eyeing MUTM Ethereum’s rally is far from surprising; its Layer-1 dominance and integration into ETFs have long made it a favorite among institutions. However, the upside is becoming increasingly limited in percentage terms. This is precisely where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines. With a presale price of just $0.035 in Phase 6 and a capped total supply of 4 billion tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains heavily undervalued by market standards. Over $13.7 million has been raised so far, with 7% of Phase 6’s 170 million tokens already sold, and over 14,700 holders are onboard—indicators of growing demand even before launch. An early investor who swapped $5,000 worth of BTC in Phase 1 has already seen over 3.5x in unrealized gains. At listing, the price is expected to reach $0.06, but mid-term forecasts are pushing it as high as $0.56, which would translate to over 16x returns from entry. The next presale price bump to $0.040 will mark a 15% jump, reinforcing the urgency among investors to enter before Phase 7 triggers. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart isn’t just presale hype—it’s the project’s clear vision to redefine decentralized lending through smart contract-based automation, scalable infrastructure, and real token utility. The upcoming beta launch, scheduled alongside the listing, will introduce users to the platform’s advanced lending models on a Layer-2 network, ensuring minimal gas fees and ultra-fast transaction speeds. This is expected to attract both DeFi enthusiasts and newcomers alike, increasing adoption and, with it, demand for MUTM tokens. Further elevating Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s profile is the likely listing on top-tier exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken. These platforms not only provide deep liquidity but also act as trust amplifiers. Once Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is exposed to millions of retail traders via these exchanges, price discovery will naturally tilt upward as users interact with its core features firsthand. Real-world utility: the key to sustained demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance’s protocol will be centered on two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, lenders will earn attractive yields by depositing assets into smart contract pools, while borrowers will access overcollateralized loans. For instance, depositing $10,000 worth of SOL with an 80% loan-to-value (LTV) will unlock an annual return of around 6.5% APY, meaning $650 passive income per year. Simultaneously, a borrower will be able to take out $8,000 in DAI, maintaining exposure to their underlying SOL. The P2P model, on the other hand, will offer personalized term negotiation and will be ideal for users seeking higher yields through higher risk exposure. Both models will be designed to operate seamlessly with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming native stablecoin, which will be minted and burned based on real borrowing activity, ensuring tight control over supply and enhanced collateral backing. To strengthen investor trust, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance has partnered with CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. The project’s Token Scan Score stands at 95, while Skynet’s monitoring score is 78—both above-industry standards. Moreover, a $50,000 bug bounty program is currently live, incentivizing white-hat developers to audit and secure the platform. $100K giveaway Adding to its promotional drive, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign . Ten lucky participants will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, a move that not only drives viral interest but also encourages community growth across social channels. The protocol already boasts over 12,000 Twitter followers, and that number is expected to climb steeply as the listing date approaches. With strong fundamentals, real-world DeFi utility, upcoming beta functionality, and major exchange exposure on the horizon, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be more than just another token launch. As Ethereum inches toward $3,800 with limited upside, investors are turning their sights toward where real exponential growth lies—and that path seems to lead directly through MUTM. The clock is ticking—Phase 7 will raise the presale price to $0.040, and buyers waiting on the sidelines may find themselves priced out of one of 2025’s most anticipated listings.

In a notice to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the Arkansas-based Highlands Oncology Group says 113,575 Americans are impacted by a massive cybersecurity incident. In a data incident notice posted on its website, Highlands says that an unauthorized entity gained access to its systems and stole files that may include patients’ names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license/state identification numbers, passport numbers, credit/debit card numbers, financial account numbers, medical treatment records, medical record numbers, patient account numbers, and/or health insurance policy records. “Highlands Oncology Group PA recently discovered a data incident that may have involved the personal information for certain individuals. On June 2, 2025, Highlands discovered it was the victim of a cyber-attack, and certain Highlands files and systems were inaccessible… The forensic investigation determined that an unauthorized third party accessed Highlands’ computer network at times between January 21, 2025, and June 2, 2025, and encrypted some of its files. The investigation also determined that the third party may have accessed and acquired certain files from Highlands’ systems during this period.” Highlands offers a full spectrum of cancer care services, including chemotherapy, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, as well as supportive services like rehabilitation, massage, lymphedema therapy, genetic counseling and pharmacy. The firm says it has sent letters of notification to affected individuals, while offering complimentary identity theft protection services for those whose Social Security numbers, driver’s license or state ID numbers were involved in the incident.

2025-08-04 08:10:11,49512255,1754295011,Ethereum Whale Unveils Strategic Accumulation After Year of Selling,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Whale Unveils Strategic Accumulation After Year of Selling In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, the movements of large holders, often dubbed ‘whales,’ can send ripples across the market. Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with news concerning a particular Ethereum whale , an early participant in Ethereum’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This address, known for consistently selling ETH over the past year, has made a remarkable pivot, resuming significant accumulation. This shift by a prominent Ethereum whale signals a potential change in market sentiment and warrants a closer look. The Ethereum Whale’s Surprising Shift: What Happened? For over a year, this specific Ethereum whale address, which acquired ETH at the incredibly low price of $0.31 during the ICO, had been a net seller. Their actions often correlated with market downturns or periods of uncertainty. However, recent on-chain analysis, notably by @ai_9684xtpa on X, reveals a significant reversal in this pattern. Over the past three weeks, this address has aggressively accumulated 13,600 ETH, valued at approximately $47 million at current prices. The most recent withdrawal occurred just moments before the analyst’s report, highlighting the immediacy of this change. To put this into perspective, the last major accumulation phase by this Ethereum whale was two years ago, involving a deposit of 6,000 ETH to the OKX Exchange. This prior move was considerably smaller than the current withdrawals, underscoring the magnitude of the present accumulation. The wallet now boasts a holding of 59,718 ETH, worth around $210 million. This drastic shift from selling to buying suggests a renewed conviction in Ethereum’s future trajectory. Action Type Timeframe ETH Volume Approx. USD Value (Current) Previous Trend Past Year Net Selling Varies Current Accumulation Last 3 Weeks 13,600 ETH $47 Million Previous Major Accumulation 2 Years Ago 6,000 ETH Significantly Less Why is This Ethereum Whale Accumulating Now? The motivations behind such a significant shift are often multifaceted, but one prominent theory points to the classic market psychology of ‘Fear Of Missing Out’ (FOMO). After a period of price consolidation or even decline, a major holder might perceive that the market is on the cusp of a significant upward move. For an Ethereum whale who has seen multiple market cycles, recognizing potential inflection points is crucial. Several factors could contribute to this renewed confidence: Anticipation of Spot ETH ETFs: While not yet approved in all jurisdictions, the potential for spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could open the floodgates for institutional capital, significantly boosting demand for ETH. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: The continuous development of Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, DeFi protocols, and NFT ecosystem strengthens its long-term utility and value proposition. Macroeconomic Factors: A shift in global economic conditions, such as potential interest rate cuts or increased liquidity, could favor risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Technical Analysis Indicators: The whale might be reacting to specific technical chart patterns or on-chain metrics that suggest an imminent price rally. This Ethereum whale , having bought ETH at a negligible price, possesses an extremely low cost basis, giving them immense flexibility. Their decision to accumulate now, rather than continuing to take profits, suggests a strong belief that Ethereum’s price has substantial room for growth from its current levels. What Does This Ethereum Whale’s Move Mean for the Market? The actions of a large Ethereum whale , particularly one with such a historical connection to the asset, can have several implications for the broader market: 1. A Potential Bullish Signal When a large, sophisticated investor with deep knowledge and early access to an asset begins to accumulate, it is often interpreted as a bullish signal. It suggests that those with significant capital and insights are positioning themselves for an upward trend. This can instill confidence in smaller investors and potentially encourage broader market participation. 2. Impact on Supply Dynamics Accumulation by whales often involves withdrawing ETH from exchanges to private wallets. This reduces the readily available supply of ETH on exchanges, which, if demand remains constant or increases, can exert upward pressure on prices. The more ETH held off-exchange, the tighter the circulating supply becomes. 3. Shifting Market Sentiment News of a major Ethereum whale accumulating can significantly influence market sentiment. It can turn a neutral or bearish outlook into a more optimistic one, as participants perceive that smart money is re-entering the market. This psychological effect can lead to increased buying pressure from other market participants, creating a positive feedback loop. 4. Validation of Ethereum’s Long-Term Value An ICO participant accumulating after a year of selling reinforces the long-term viability and potential of Ethereum. It suggests that even after years of market volatility, significant players still see fundamental value and growth potential in the network and its native asset. Actionable Insights from Ethereum Whale Behavior While tracking Ethereum whale movements provides valuable insights, it’s important for individual investors to approach this information with a balanced perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Observe, Don’t Blindly Follow: Whale movements are one data point among many. They can indicate market trends or shifts in sentiment, but they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Understand On-Chain Analytics: Tools that track whale movements are part of a larger field of on-chain analytics. Learning how to interpret these data points can provide a deeper understanding of market flows and participant behavior. Focus on Fundamentals: Ultimately, an asset’s long-term value is driven by its utility, adoption, and development.

An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their transactions, especially large ones, can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their holdings. Q2: Why are Ethereum whale movements important? Whale movements are important because they can indicate shifts in market sentiment, potential future price trends, and the conviction of large, often sophisticated, investors. Their buying or selling can impact liquidity and supply on exchanges. Q3: What is on-chain analysis?

Lise, short for Lightning Stock Exchange, is set to be Europe’s first tokenized exchange focused on streamlining equity financing and public listings for smaller firms, CACEIS said in a press release on Monday. Lise is currently awaiting regulatory approval as a DLT Trading and Settlement System (DLT TSS) under the European pilot regime. If approved, it would allow companies to issue, trade, and settle financial instruments directly on a distributed ledger, cutting down the time and costs associated with traditional IPO processes. Lise would allow investors to trade shares on a secondary market that operates around the clock, without the bottlenecks of standard clearing houses, or lengthy coordination of multiple intermediaries. The move aligns with CACEIS’s broader push into digital assets, which saw it receive MiCA approval earlier this year. Founded in 2018, Kriptown develops infrastructure for tokenizing financial instruments, integrating both market and post-trade operations.

2025-08-04 08:05:37,49512119,1754294737,"Ripple CTO Once Said $1,000,000 Per XRP Is More Practical Than $1. Here’s why","A resurfaced comment from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has drawn renewed attention following a tweet from crypto investor XRP Governor. The tweet references Schwartz’s Quora response from several years ago, in which he argues that a high market price for XRP is beneficial for its use in large-scale payments, rather than a hindrance to adoption. XRP Governor highlighted the implications of Schwartz’s perspective with the assertion: “Ripple CTO David Schwartz says $1,000,000 per $XRP is more practical than $1. This isn’t fantasy — it’s coming from the architect of the XRP Ledger.” This claim is rooted in Schwartz’s original remarks addressing concerns that a finite and potentially high-priced XRP could obstruct mainstream adoption by banks . The concern, posed by a Quora user, suggested that if XRP cannot be mined and must be purchased, financial institutions might prefer the asset to remain low-priced to avoid increased costs. Schwartz rejected that view by explaining the underlying economic mechanics of high-value digital assets and their correlation with liquidity. BREAKING: Ripple CTO David Schwartz says $1,000,000 per $XRP is more practical than $1. This isn’t fantasy — it’s coming from the architect of the XRP Ledger. KNOW WHAT YOU HODL. pic.twitter.com/bHDGsfzCJr — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) August 2, 2025 David Schwartz’s Response on Asset Pricing and Liquidity Schwartz’s argument centers on the relationship between asset pricing, liquidity, and transaction efficiency. He stated clearly that to make a $1 million payment, one would always need $1 million worth of XRP , regardless of the unit price of the asset. According to Schwartz, the concern about high prices deterring adoption overlooks a critical dynamic: higher prices generally imply greater market liquidity, which makes it easier and cheaper to execute large payments without disrupting the market. To illustrate his point, Schwartz used the historical example of Bitcoin. He described a scenario in which a person attempted to use Bitcoin priced at $100 to buy a $1 million property. Such a purchase would have required buying a massive amount of Bitcoin, significantly moving the market upward during the purchase, and then driving the price downward again when the recipient attempted to convert it. Schwartz noted that this volatility and slippage would have rendered such a transaction impractical. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He contrasted this with the state of Bitcoin when it surpassed $10,000. At this higher valuation, one could acquire $1 million worth of Bitcoin using a far smaller portion of the total circulating supply, reducing the impact on market price and ensuring a smoother transaction. Schwartz concluded that this same principle applies to XRP. He wrote that “a higher priced asset is a better vehicle for payments, at least if you’re targeting high value payments.” XRP Governor Emphasizes the Practicality of High XRP Valuation XRP Governor’s tweet emphasized that these views were not speculative comments from an outsider but came directly from the CTO of Ripple and one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger. By highlighting the quote about $1 million per XRP being more practical than $1, XRP Governor framed Schwartz’s past remarks as validation for the long-term potential of XRP to reach high valuations, provided it becomes an asset used globally for large-scale cross-border payments. The tweet also included the statement “KNOW WHAT YOU HODL,” reinforcing a narrative that long-term XRP holders should consider Schwartz’s liquidity argument as part of their rationale for holding the asset. The suggestion is that mainstream utility of XRP at a high unit price is not incompatible with adoption, but rather may be an enabler of it.

2025-08-04 08:03:46,49512962,1754294626,Binance Opens 'Bitcoin Options Writing' to All Users,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Monday that it is opening access to bitcoin (BTC) ""options writing"" for all users. The move is a direct response to a significant increase in retail demand for more strategic and sophisticated trading tools. Options are derivative contracts that allow the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a pre-determined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market while a put option offers downside protection. Writing options refers to selling call or put, which is akin to offering insurance against bullish or bearish price moves in the underlying asset. The writer (seller) is compensated for the same in the form of an upfront premium. Sophisticated crypto holders are known to write options to earn extra yield on top of the spot market holdings. “Accelerating crypto adoption will increase demand for more sophisticated liquidity tools and we are committed to building a fuller suite of derivative products to support our users.” Jeff Li, VP of product at Binance, commented on the development. Binance said it will maintain robust risk management controls, requiring options writers to pass a mandatory suitability assessment and post margin to collateralize their obligations. The announcement comes as the broader BTC options market has seen explosive growth, with total trading volume soaring over 3200% from $4.11 billion in 2020 to $138.76 billion in June 2025, Binance's press release shared with CoinDesk said. By enabling a broader user base to write options, Binance aims to empower traders to express market views, manage risk, earn upfront premiums, and implement strategies that go beyond simple directional bets. To celebrate the launch, Binance is offering a 20% discount on Taker and Maker fees for all newly listed options contracts, including those for ether (ETH), BNB (BNB), and Solana (SOL). The exchange is also improving its Options Enhanced Program for high-volume and institutional traders, offering lower qualification thresholds and more attractive fee structures.

2025-08-04 08:01:13,49512960,1754294473,Coinbase Slides Nearly 20% in Worst Weekly Performance Since September 2024,"Shares in Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) tanked 19.6% to $314.69 last week, registering its worst performance since September 2024, according to data source TradingView. On Thursday, COIN published its second-quarter earnings report, revealing a net operating earnings per share of 12 cents, with an 88.8% year-over-year decrease in the bottom line. The $1.5 billion in revenue fell short of FactSet's $1.59 billion estimate, while the EBIDTA declined to $512 million as transaction revenue slipped 39% from the previous quarter. The price sell-off is consistent with the late June analysis by crypto research firm 10x , which stated that the second-quarter price rally appeared overstretched relative to fundamentals. The firm recommended shorting COIN while buying BTC. Early last month, investment firm H.C. Wainwright sharply downgraded Coinbase to Sell from Buy, saying that the second quarter rally outpaced fundamentals. COIN put options in demand The sell-off has traders chasing downside protection in COIN. As of Friday, the one-year put-call skew, which measures the implied volatility (demand) differential between put and call options, rose to 2.6%, the highest since April 21, according to data source Market Chameleon . In other words, put options, offering insurance against price losses in the underlying asset, traded at a 2.6 volatility premium to call options or bullish bets.

2025-08-04 08:00:29,49511898,1754294429,"Ethereum Eyes $5K, But Ozak AI’s Presale Could Deliver Bigger Gains","Ethereum’s price performance has been impressive. After briefly touching $3,900, it retraced to $3,500, yet analysts remain confident. Based on MVRV pricing bands, respected trader Ali Martinez believes ETH could still target the $5,000 level. On-chain signals and strong fundamentals are painting a bullish outlook for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. But while ETH stirs anticipation, early investors are shifting focus. Ozak AI’s presale presents a rare opportunity, one backed by utility, transparency, and real-world infrastructure. Ethereum Rally Signals Strength as MVRV Bands Flash Bullish Ethereum’s recent market rally to $3,900 is an indication of intent and confidence among investors despite a pullback to the $3,500 retracement level. To add to that, popular market analyst Ali Martinez noted that historical MVRV patterns suggest that ETH is on course to consolidate around a new ATH of $5000. Currently, ETH traded around $3,509 with a 24% increase in trading volume to take it to $40 million in the last seven days. Also, increasing open interest further backs Ethereum's bullish momentum, with crypto futures showing that more traders are solidifying their stance on Ethereum, signaling a potential for further uptrend. Presale Energy Around Ozak AI Is Catching Smart Money Attention Although Ethereum is enjoying a measure of increasing market rally, a new entrant, Ozak AI , is slowly making a name for itself despite being in the presale phase. The protocol fuses blockchain with AI to create a powerful tool, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). This tool provides data scalability and security in real time. The project is currently in its fourth phase of presale at $0.005, with over 67 million tokens having been sold so far. Conversely, more than $1.5 million in funds were raised, signalling increasing investors' interest. At launch, the protocol is expected to list at $0.05 with a possibility of soaring to $1. A Closer Look at Ozak AI’s Technical Architecture Ozak AI makes its mark by blending blockchain’s distributed records with smart contracts, deciding how data gets shared and stored, and IPFS nodes keeping it all decentralized. Ozak AI removes single points of failure, locking in security, backup, and smooth performance. This kind of setup is a must for industries where handling sensitive, real-time data isn’t optional and where trust and speed aren’t things you can afford to gamble on. Whether it’s powering self-driving cars or crunching numbers for financial models, Ozak AI keeps data moving fast, crystal-clear, and solid as a rock. Community Growth and $1M Giveaway Fuel Presale Demand The $1 million giveaway campaign is doing more than attracting attention; it’s building a strong early community. To participate, the bidders need to contribute just $100 worth of $OZ tokens, and over 100 winners have already been announced. The first prize is $100,000, while the second prize is $50,000. The transparency and steady pace of transparency and fundraising add a layer of legitimacy that’s often missing in early-stage Web3 projects. ETH is Maturing, But Ozak AI May Offer More Room to Grow Ethereum is holding strong, backed by seasoned investor trust and solid long-term fundamentals. But in a market where speed and timing can flip the game, newer plays like Ozak AI might bring bigger gains with way less capital to start. With a working product, a sharp tech stack, and early momentum, Ozak AI has the potential to be a real challenger in the data infrastructure space, while Ethereum stays focused on the marathon.

Key Takeaways: Trump Media plans to launch a Truth-branded token and digital wallet as part of a new rewards program. The token may see expanded use across the broader Truth ecosystem, signaling a deeper crypto push. The company is also pursuing crypto ETFs and holds $2B in Bitcoin-related assets. The disclosure marks the first official appearance of the initiative in public financial documents, months after it was first hinted at in a shareholder letter. The proposed token would be part of a larger “rewards program” tied to a “Truth digital wallet,” which will initially allow users to pay for Truth+ subscriptions. Trump Media Eyes Ecosystem Expansion with Truth Token Trump Media suggests the token may eventually be used across a broader range of products and services within the “Truth ecosphere,” hinting at an expanding digital footprint. Though the company avoids labeling the asset as a cryptocurrency, the language used in the Q2 filing strongly implies that blockchain infrastructure is involved. The move is part of a wider shift toward digital assets, as the firm deepens its crypto strategy. In July, Trump Media made headlines after deploying $2 billion into Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities, placing it among the top five public holders of BTC globally. Earlier, it secured $2.4 billion in a private placement round, with $1 billion now listed as restricted collateral for convertible notes. Trump has 3+ years in office. His company, Trump Media, bought almost 2B USD worth of $BTC and other cryptos. And you think the cycle top was in? Higher pic.twitter.com/w1k7Sq33GR — Degen Ape Trader (@DegenApe99) August 3, 2025 Beyond token plans, Trump Media’s fintech division, Truth.Fi, has filed for several crypto exchange-traded funds , including products linked to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a broader “Crypto Blue Chip” index. Despite posting its first positive operating cash flow, $2.3 million for the quarter, the company still recorded a net loss of $20 million, citing stock-based compensation and costs tied to its 2024 SPAC merger. CEO Devin Nunes has positioned the company’s crypto efforts as a defense mechanism against what he describes as financial censorship and discrimination by traditional institutions. Trump Nets Over $26M in Crypto Donations This Year As reported, the crypto industry has donated over $26 million to Donald Trump this year, according to newly released campaign finance filings. Campaign finance records show that contributions to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., came from some of the biggest names in crypto. Blockchain.com led the list with a $5 million donation. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz each gave $3 million, while Gemini Trust added nearly $3 million. Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss also contributed $500,000 each personally. Other major donors include Ondo Finance with $2.1 million and Paradigm, which gave $1.2 million. Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth . Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates that TMTG stock represents $2.2 billion of Trump’s $6.6 billion fortune.

2025-08-04 07:55:10,49511669,1754294110,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unveiling Crucial Rallies Before Market Correction,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unveiling Crucial Rallies Before Market Correction The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, constantly evolving and keeping investors on their toes. For many, the burning question remains: What’s next for Bitcoin? A prominent voice from CryptoQuant, analyst Axel Adler Jr., has unveiled a compelling Bitcoin price prediction that suggests two more significant rallies are on the horizon before the market potentially shifts into a correction phase. This insight offers a fascinating glimpse into the immediate future of the world’s leading cryptocurrency, sparking discussions and strategic planning among enthusiasts and seasoned traders alike. Understanding the Bitcoin Price Prediction: What’s the Outlook? Axel Adler Jr.’s recent analysis, shared on X, provides a nuanced Bitcoin price prediction . He anticipates that Bitcoin will experience two additional upward movements, or rallies, before the selling pressure from investors eventually outweighs the demand, leading to a market correction. This perspective is rooted in observing shifts in investor behavior and market dynamics. According to Adler, a key indicator of this impending shift is the weakening of investor risk appetite, a common occurrence as a bull cycle matures. In the final stages of a bull market, investors typically become more cautious. The initial euphoria and aggressive buying gradually give way to a more conservative approach, where profit-taking becomes a dominant theme. This change in sentiment is crucial for understanding the analyst’s Bitcoin price prediction , as it directly impacts market liquidity and price sustainability. As more participants look to secure gains, the collective selling pressure naturally increases, setting the stage for a potential downturn. Key Metrics Driving the Bitcoin Price Prediction Adler’s Bitcoin price prediction is not just based on sentiment; it’s backed by specific on-chain metrics. He highlights a particular Bitcoin metric that surpassed a value of 1.9 in both March and December 2024. What’s significant now is that this same metric is forming a lower peak. This pattern is a critical signal, indicating that more holders are actively selling their Bitcoin, which consequently puts downward pressure on prices. It suggests a gradual shift from accumulation to distribution among long-term holders. Let’s break down what this metric behavior implies: Profit-Taking Continues: Despite price surges, the analyst notes that profit-taking activities are persistent. This means that even as Bitcoin’s value rises, a significant portion of holders are choosing to sell, locking in their gains rather than holding for further appreciation. Diminishing Margins: Each subsequent price surge, while positive, is yielding a smaller margin above investors’ original cost basis. This indicates that the market is becoming less efficient in generating substantial new profits for existing holders, making the incentive to sell stronger. Supply-Demand Imbalance: The lower peak in the key metric suggests a subtle but growing imbalance where the supply of Bitcoin being sold starts to outpace the demand from new buyers. This fundamental shift is a precursor to a potential correction, aligning with the analyst’s Bitcoin price prediction . To visualize the typical phases of a market cycle and how such metrics might align, consider the following simplified representation: Market Phase Investor Sentiment Metric Behavior (General) Accumulation Skepticism/Hope Low Activity, Gradual Buying Bull Run (Early/Mid) Optimism/Greed High Activity, Rising Metrics Bull Run (Late) Exuberance/Caution High Metrics, Forming Lower Peaks Correction/Bear Fear/Despair Falling Metrics, Low Activity External Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Price Prediction Beyond on-chain data, macroeconomic factors play a significant role in any Bitcoin price prediction . Axel Adler Jr. specifically points to the two expected interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year as further support for his outlook. Historically, periods of lower interest rates tend to make riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies, more attractive to investors. When the cost of borrowing money decreases, capital often flows into higher-yielding investments, including digital assets. However, the timing and magnitude of these rate cuts are crucial. While they can provide a tailwind for asset prices, their impact can also be complex. If rate cuts are perceived as a response to weakening economic conditions, they might not always translate directly into sustained rallies. The market’s interpretation of these monetary policy decisions is key. In this context, the expected rate cuts could fuel the anticipated two rallies by injecting fresh liquidity and boosting investor confidence, but their eventual effect could also align with the weakening risk appetite as the market anticipates a broader economic slowdown or a ‘sell the news’ event. Navigating the Market: What Should Investors Consider with this Bitcoin Price Prediction? For investors considering this Bitcoin price prediction , understanding its implications is vital. While the prospect of two more rallies is exciting, the subsequent correction highlights the inherent volatility and cyclical nature of the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights and considerations: Risk Management: It’s crucial to have a robust risk management strategy in place. This includes setting clear profit targets and stop-loss levels. Given the prediction of a correction, being prepared to protect capital is paramount. Diversification: While Bitcoin often leads the market, diversifying one’s portfolio across different assets, including other cryptocurrencies and traditional investments, can help mitigate risks during a downturn. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market metrics, economic news, and expert analyses. The crypto market moves quickly, and staying updated can help in making timely decisions. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term trading opportunities presented by the rallies and a long-term investment strategy. A correction might be a buying opportunity for long-term holders, but a challenging period for short-term traders. Emotional Discipline: Market predictions, especially those involving corrections, can trigger strong emotions. Maintaining emotional discipline and sticking to a predefined strategy is essential to avoid impulsive decisions. The challenges in this market scenario primarily revolve around timing and managing expectations. Predicting exact peaks and troughs is notoriously difficult. The benefit, however, lies in being forewarned. Knowing that a correction might be on the horizon allows investors to adjust their strategies, potentially securing profits or preparing for future buying opportunities. Conclusion: A Prudent Bitcoin Price Prediction Axel Adler Jr.’s Bitcoin price prediction offers a valuable perspective on the immediate future of the crypto market. His analysis, grounded in on-chain metrics and macroeconomic factors like interest rate cuts, paints a picture of two final rallies before a potential correction. This outlook underscores the importance of vigilance, strategic planning, and understanding the evolving sentiment within the crypto community. While the allure of further gains is strong, the anticipation of a subsequent correction serves as a vital reminder for investors to approach the market with caution and well-defined strategies. As the market continues its dance between supply and demand, staying informed and adaptable will be key to navigating the exciting yet unpredictable journey of Bitcoin.

In the firm’s latest Fintech Newsletter, a16z general partner Alex Rampell says that crypto may be looking at “Chokepoint 3.0” – or a sequel to the Biden administration’s attempts to debank and deplatform crypto companies, commonly referred to as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Rampell is referring to JPMorgan’s recent decision to begin charging fees to crypto and fintech companies to access simple data about the bank’s customers, like routing codes or account numbers. Rampell says the new fees, which are “insanely high,” are about strangling the competition, not about generating new revenue. “JPMorganChase is an $800 billion company. Make no mistake: this isn’t about a new revenue stream. It’s about strangling competition. And if they get away with this, every bank will follow… The crazy thing is that sometimes this data is just your account number and routing code. That’s right: information that’s printed on the bottom of every check. And yet, if delivered electronically, somehow banks are asserting that it should come with tremendous fees – paid to banks that were collectively bailed out by taxpayers a mere 17 years ago. If it suddenly costs $10 to move $100 into a Coinbase or Robinhood account, maybe fewer people will do it. Or if it costs $10 to get a cheaper loan from a fintech, maybe you’ll be forced to take a crappier one from JPM. And if JPM and others can block consumers from connecting their own freely chosen crypto and fintech apps to their bank accounts, they effectively eliminate competition.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With market momentum slowing down, these cryptocurrencies might be gearing up for significant moves. Find out which coins are primed for growth and could potentially reward investors despite the current trend. Aptos Price Trends and Key Trading Zones Aptos prices have experienced notable declines recently, with a one-month drop of around 12.40% and a half-year decrease of about 36.27%. This downward trend reflects growing bearish pressure amidst cautious market sentiment. Price retracements and waning investor confidence are significant factors behind these declines. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 33.30 suggest oversold conditions, while oscillators indicate a potential short-term rebound that remains unconfirmed. Currently, Aptos trades within a range of approximately $3.65 to $5.60, facing near-term resistance at $6.89 and a secondary target at $8.84. Key support exists around $2.98, with a deeper level at $1.02. The recent performance indicates significant bearish sentiment, driven by a one-week decline of 13.46%. Mixed signals from technical indicators and the RSI at 33.30 suggest caution, as bears dominate the market and a clear upward trend is lacking. Trading strategies may involve looking for potential rebounds around $2.98 while monitoring resistance levels at $6.89 and $8.84 for short opportunities. Pi Network Price Trends and Trading Opportunities Past month PI performance shows a notable decline with a drop of 26.32%, while the past six months witnessed a significant surge of 263.9%. Price action reflects bearish pressure with a 17.56% decrease over one week, indicating heightened volatility. The chart highlights a transition from recent bearish sentiment to strong upward movement in the six-month period. While the longer-term outlook displays considerable gains, the near-term trend has faced pressure, hinting at potential corrections. Momentum indicators have dimmed, and recent declines suggest short-term resistance that may challenge traders even after substantial gains. The current price range of Pi Network oscillates between $0.36 and $0.49, with support at $0.32 and resistance at $0.57, extending to a second support of $0.19 and a second resistance at $0.70. Bulls are finding support at the lower boundary, yet a low RSI of 27.64 and negative momentum show that bears are still influential. The trading zone between key levels presents opportunities for timely entries anticipating an uptrend. Short-term traders might consider buying near the support zone while monitoring resistance levels. Without a clear trend, traders must assess the risks between oversold conditions and potential pullbacks from resistance levels as market sentiment fluctuates. Mantle: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Weakness Mantle recorded an 18.59% rise over the last month, contrasting sharply with a 43.26% drop over the past six months. The recent upward movement hints at some recovery and renewed investor interest despite a longer-term weakening trend. This short-term rally stands in stark contrast to the prolonged decline observed over half a year. The price movement reflects a potential bargain for those seeking quick gains, even as concerns about sustained strength linger due to the overall downward trajectory. The coin now trades in a range from $0.58 to $0.88, with key levels clearly defined. Immediate resistance appears near $1.01, while solid support is found at $0.42. A mixed picture emerges from current indicators; a recent drop of 12.51% and slightly negative momentum suggest bearish influence, yet other factors indicate resilient buyers. The market lacks a clear trend, with bulls trying to regain ground while bears remain cautious. Trading strategies may involve entering near support and taking profits at resistance, requiring careful position management and close monitoring of market indicators. Conclusion APT , PI , and MNT are at a pivotal point as they face declining momentum. Markets have shown slow but steady movement. These coins, however, exhibit potential for a rebound. APT could see increased activity due to recent developments. PI shows promising trends with consistent interest from the community. MNT also hints at a possible upturn with new partnerships on the horizon. Watching these coins closely in the coming week is advisable.

2025-08-04 07:50:10,49511506,1754293810,Ethereum Whale Withdrawal: Unpacking the $10 Million Kraken Move,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Whale Withdrawal: Unpacking the $10 Million Kraken Move In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, few events capture attention quite like a significant Ethereum whale withdrawal . Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a massive 2,850 ETH, valued at an astonishing $10.09 million, being moved from the Kraken exchange. This isn’t just a large transaction; it’s a potential signal from one of the market’s most influential players, and understanding its implications is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset landscape. Let’s dive into what this major move signifies for the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market. What Does a Large Ethereum Whale Withdrawal Mean? When an anonymous entity, often referred to as a “whale” due to their immense holdings, moves a substantial amount of cryptocurrency off an exchange, it typically signals a shift in strategy. In this particular instance, an address identified as 0x1c11 executed a significant Ethereum whale withdrawal from Kraken. Data from Onchain Lens on X confirmed this transaction, highlighting the transfer of 2,850 ETH, equivalent to over $10 million at the time of withdrawal. This address now holds a staggering 18,111 ETH, valued at approximately $64 million, suggesting a long-term conviction in Ethereum’s value rather than short-term trading. Such withdrawals are generally interpreted as a move towards holding, or “hodling,” as it removes assets from immediate trading liquidity. This contrasts sharply with deposits to exchanges, which often precede selling pressure. The sheer scale of this particular Ethereum whale withdrawal commands attention because whale movements can sometimes precede broader market trends, acting as an indicator for smaller investors. It suggests that a powerful market participant sees more value in holding their ETH off-exchange than in keeping it readily available for sale. Why Do Whales Withdraw ETH from Exchanges? The motivations behind a significant Ethereum whale withdrawal are multifaceted, but they generally revolve around a few key strategic decisions: Enhanced Security: Moving funds from an exchange to a private, self-custodied wallet (often a hardware wallet) significantly reduces counterparty risk. While exchanges offer convenience, they are susceptible to hacks, regulatory issues, or operational failures. A whale, with millions at stake, prioritizes the security of their assets above all else. Long-Term Holding (Hodling): A withdrawal indicates an intent to hold assets for an extended period, rather than actively trade them. This suggests the whale believes Ethereum’s value will appreciate over time, making short-term price fluctuations less relevant to their strategy. It’s a vote of confidence in the asset’s future potential. Staking or DeFi Participation: Once off an exchange, ETH can be used for various decentralized finance (DeFi) activities or staked to earn yield. With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking ETH is a popular way to earn passive income, and it requires holding ETH in a non-custodial wallet to participate directly. Reduced Trading Temptation: By removing funds from an active trading platform, whales can avoid impulsive trading decisions driven by market volatility. This disciplined approach aligns with a long-term investment philosophy, protecting their substantial capital from short-term market noise. To illustrate the difference in asset management strategies, consider the following comparison: Aspect Holding on Exchange Self-Custody (Post-Withdrawal) Security Risk Higher (Exchange hacks, regulatory risks) Lower (User controls private keys) Purpose Active Trading, Quick Access Long-Term Holding, Staking, DeFi Control Exchange controls keys User controls keys Liquidity High (Ready to sell) Lower (Needs to be redeposited to sell) The decision to move assets from an exchange is a strategic one, often reflecting a long-term bullish outlook. Ethereum Whale Withdrawal: Unpacking the $10 Million Kraken Move How Do Whales Influence the Ethereum Market? The actions of whales, especially a significant Ethereum whale withdrawal , can send ripples through the market. While no single whale can unilaterally control the entire market, their movements are closely watched for several reasons: Sentiment Indicator: A large withdrawal is often seen as a bullish signal. It suggests that a major holder is not planning to sell in the near future, reducing potential selling pressure. Conversely, large deposits to exchanges can indicate an impending sell-off, which traders often interpret as a bearish sign. Supply Dynamics: When ETH is moved off exchanges, the circulating supply available for immediate trading decreases. In theory, if demand remains constant or increases, a reduced supply on exchanges could lead to upward price pressure. This basic economic principle of supply and demand plays out vividly in the crypto markets. Follow-the-Leader Effect: Smaller investors and algorithmic traders often monitor whale movements. If a prominent whale makes a move, others might follow suit, amplifying the initial signal. This herd mentality can sometimes accelerate market trends, whether positive or negative. However, it is crucial to remember that whale movements are not infallible predictors. The identity and exact intentions of the anonymous whale remain unknown. They could be moving funds for private sales, institutional transfers, or other reasons not immediately apparent to the public. Therefore, while this Ethereum whale withdrawal is noteworthy, it should be considered as one data point among many when assessing overall market conditions and future price action. What are the Challenges and Risks of Tracking Whale Movements? While on-chain data provides unprecedented transparency into cryptocurrency movements, interpreting whale activity, such as a large Ethereum whale withdrawal , comes with its own set of challenges and risks: Anonymity: Blockchain addresses are pseudonymous. We can see the transactions, but we don’t know who owns the address (an individual, an institution, a fund, or even multiple entities). This anonymity makes it difficult to ascertain the exact motivations behind their actions, adding a layer of uncertainty. Misinterpretation: A withdrawal might not always mean “hodling.” It could be a transfer to another wallet for security reasons, an OTC (over-the-counter) sale that doesn’t involve an exchange, or preparation for a large institutional transaction. Without complete context, interpretations can be speculative and potentially misleading. Market Manipulation: Sophisticated whales might intentionally make movements to influence market sentiment, creating FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) to benefit their own trading strategies. While less common with withdrawals for holding, the possibility of deceptive moves exists. Data Overload: The sheer volume of on-chain data can be overwhelming for the average user. Identifying truly significant whale movements requires specialized tools and expertise, like those provided by Onchain Lens, to filter out noise and identify meaningful patterns that are genuinely indicative of market shifts. Therefore, while observing a significant Ethereum whale withdrawal offers valuable insights, it is vital for investors to combine this information with broader market analysis, fundamental project developments, and macroeconomic factors before making investment decisions. Relying solely on whale movements can lead to incomplete or inaccurate conclusions. Actionable Insights for Investors from This Ethereum Whale Withdrawal For the average investor, the news of a substantial Ethereum whale withdrawal can be more than just an interesting headline; it can offer valuable perspectives for refining one’s own investment strategy. Here are some actionable insights you might consider: Consider Your Time Horizon: If large players are moving assets for long-term holding, it encourages retail investors to re-evaluate their own time horizons. Short-term trading is high-risk and often leads to losses, while a long-term view, similar to that implied by whale withdrawals, can often yield better and more stable results. Prioritize Security: The whale’s move to self-custody highlights the importance of securing your assets. For smaller amounts, a reputable exchange might suffice, but as your holdings grow, exploring hardware wallets and other self-custody solutions becomes increasingly important to protect your investments from external risks. Diversify Information Sources: Do not rely solely on whale movements. Combine on-chain data with fundamental analysis of Ethereum’s ecosystem, technological advancements (like scaling solutions and upgrades), adoption rates, and overall macroeconomic trends. A holistic view provides a more robust understanding. Avoid Emotional Decisions: While a whale withdrawal can spark optimism, resist the urge to make impulsive buys. Instead, use such data points to inform a well-thought-out investment plan based on your own risk tolerance, financial goals, and thorough research, rather than reacting to every market signal. Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analytics providers and crypto news sources to stay updated on significant market movements. Understanding these trends, including large transfers like this Ethereum whale withdrawal , can provide an edge in anticipating potential shifts and making more informed decisions. This particular Ethereum whale withdrawal from Kraken serves as a powerful reminder that significant capital is being positioned for what appears to be a long-term play on Ethereum’s future. It underscores the ongoing maturation of the crypto market, where sophisticated investors are making calculated moves beyond daily price swings, focusing on the underlying value and long-term potential of digital assets. The recent Ethereum whale withdrawal of $10.09 million from Kraken by address 0x1c11 is a notable event in the crypto space. This substantial movement of 2,850 ETH off an exchange suggests a strong intent to hold assets for the long term, rather than for immediate trading. While whale actions can influence market sentiment and supply dynamics, it is crucial for investors to interpret such data cautiously, combining it with comprehensive research and a disciplined approach. This event reinforces the growing trend among large holders to prioritize security and long-term conviction in their digital asset strategies, highlighting the importance of understanding on-chain analytics in today’s crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH), typically enough to significantly influence market sentiment or price movements with their transactions. These holdings often range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of ETH. 2. Why are whale withdrawals from exchanges considered significant? Whale withdrawals are significant because they often indicate an intent to hold assets for the long term (hodling) rather than selling them immediately. Moving funds off an exchange reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market and can be interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting the whale has strong conviction in the asset’s future value. 3. How does an Ethereum whale withdrawal affect ETH price? While not a direct cause-and-effect, a large Ethereum whale withdrawal can positively influence market sentiment by reducing the supply of ETH available on exchanges for immediate sale. This perceived scarcity, combined with the “follow-the-leader” effect, can sometimes contribute to upward price pressure, though it’s one of many factors influencing price. 4. Is it safer to keep ETH in a self-custodied wallet than on an exchange? Generally, yes, for large amounts. Self-custody, especially with hardware wallets, provides greater security as you control your private keys, eliminating counterparty risk from exchange hacks or failures. However, it also places full responsibility for security on the user, requiring careful management of private keys and recovery phrases. 5. What is Onchain Lens, and how does it track whale movements? Onchain Lens is a blockchain analytics tool or platform (as referenced in the article) that monitors and interprets real-time data from public blockchains. It identifies large transactions, tracks specific addresses, and provides insights into market movements, including significant whale activities like the Ethereum whale withdrawal discussed. 6. Can I track Ethereum whale movements myself? Yes, to some extent. You can use public blockchain explorers (like Etherscan) to view transactions. However, interpreting these movements, identifying whale addresses, and understanding their broader implications often requires specialized on-chain analytics platforms and expertise, as raw data can be complex and overwhelming for casual observers. Did you find this analysis of the Ethereum whale withdrawal insightful?

JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.595, resulting in a correction to $1.479. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO up today? JTO’s price gained strong buying pressure around local lows, resulting in a strong push. This created a push above $1.7. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction August 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price.

2025-08-04 07:48:49,49514813,1754293729,"Falling Market - Is It Strategic Time To Collect Meme Tokens? Can SPX, DOGE & PEPE Trigger Massive Moves In August?","With the crypto market in decline, the spotlight turns to meme tokens. Could strategic investments in SPX , DOGE , and PEPE lead to significant gains in August? This article delves into whether these popular coins are poised for a breakthrough, offering insights into potential growth opportunities amid market turbulence. SPX6900 Momentum Surge and Key Levels Amid Recent Pullback SPX showed a strong performance with a 21.44% gain over the last month, signaling positive trader sentiment. In the past six months, it appreciated by 73.60%, showcasing robust long-term enthusiasm. A recent one-week correction of -21.12% interrupted this upward trend, revealing short-term volatility. The trading range between $1.03 and $2.26 highlights moments of both bullish strength and volatility, indicating that while investor confidence remains strong, occasional setbacks are part of the journey. Currently, SPX6900 is navigating a contested range as buyers and sellers compete. Resistance is marked at $2.89, with a secondary level at $4.11, while support stands firm at $0.44. Mixed indicators show modest upward energy on the Awesome Oscillator, but the Momentum Indicator and RSI near 44 suggest a neutral position. Bulls aim to surpass $2.26 for breakout chances, while bears have recently affected pricing. Traders should monitor reactions around $2.89 and consider dips for entry, using tight stops below support. Dogecoin: Recent Moves and Key Levels for Traders A one month increase of 14.20% contrasts with a six month decline of 31.51%. Price activity shows a rapid rebound in the short term followed by a notable correction in the longer view. The coin has experienced gains in recent weeks even as broader market forces have pulled the overall trend down during the half-year period. Past performance reflects moments of recovery and periods of downward pressure, highlighting a divergence between short-term optimism and long-term caution. The current DOGE price range sits between $0.15 and $0.28. Immediate support is near $0.09 while resistance is marked at $0.35, with a secondary level around $0.48 presenting a potential target for upward moves. Technical signals offer mixed views. Negative values in the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator alongside an RSI below 50 indicate a cautious market with bear influence in the short term. Bulls have pushed prices upward recently, but bears remain active near the resistance zone. Trading ideas favor watching for a breakthrough above $0.35 to signal a bullish move or looking to short if prices drop below the support at $0.09. The current picture suggests a range-bound market where careful monitoring of these key levels could yield promising opportunities. PePe (PEPE) Altcoin Price Action and Key Market Levels Overview Over the last month, Pepe managed a modest rebound of about 1.74% after a sharp one-week drop of nearly 16.91% that caught several traders off guard. Over the six-month window, a decline of roughly 6.37% was recorded, underscoring a longer-term challenge despite intermittent positive movements. Price fluctuations have maintained a relatively narrow range, indicating consolidation periods followed by quick reversals that amplified market uncertainty. The interplay between a brief monthly uptick and a broader half-year downturn highlights the coin’s volatile nature, with short-term trading sentiment occasionally clashing with medium-term performance trends. At present, PEPE trades within a tight corridor between roughly $0.00000839 and $0.00001396, with a clear resistance at about $0.00001714 and a stronger barrier around $0.00002271 that could halt upward moves. Support is seen near $0.00000599, with an even deeper level at roughly $0.0000004187 offering potential stability. Negative readings on the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator point to selling pressure, while an RSI of 36.74 is close to oversold territory. This mix of signals leaves the trend unclear, as bears currently dominate market sentiment. Trading ideas focus on monitoring these key levels closely, considering cautious buy entries near support, with stop-loss settings if prices slide further, while a breach above resistance could spark bullish activity. Conclusion The current market downturn presents a potential opportunity to collect meme tokens. SPX , DOGE , and PEPE could see significant movement in August.

2025-08-04 07:47:31,49513643,1754293651,Rebound Or Fall? Litecoin & Uniswap Faces Crucial Crossroads - Future Value Goals For LTC And UNI,"The future of Litecoin and Uniswap hangs in the balance, teetering between resurgence and decline. Investors are keeping a close eye on key indicators as these cryptocurrencies approach a critical juncture. What lies ahead for LTC and UNI? Explore the potential paths and their implications for future value. The stakes have never been higher. Litecoin Price Action: Rapid Month Rise and Defined Support-Resistance Zones Litecoin experienced a dynamic shift with a 21.24% jump over the past month despite a slight weekly dip of 5.29%. Over the last six months, the coin managed a modest gain of 0.79%, reflecting limited long-term movement. Short-term price fluctuations have stood out against this broader stability, inviting traders to examine the heightened month-over-month activity while remaining cautious of the prevailing overall stagnation. Currently, Litecoin trades within a defined range marked by a price spread between $84.91 and $124.80. The immediate resistance level stands near $143.51, while additional resistance appears at approximately $183.40. On the downside, the nearest support is around $63.72, with another floor at $23.82. The market displays mixed signals as short-term indicators suggest potential selling pressure. However, some momentum readings indicate underlying strength. Traders may consider buying opportunities at support around $63.72 and taking profits near the $143.51 resistance level. The absence of a clear long-term trend necessitates caution as bulls and bears contend for market control. Uptrend Amid Volatility: UNI Price Action in Focus UNI showed a mixed performance over the last month and six months. The coin recorded a notable one-month gain of nearly 20% but also experienced a significant one-week drop exceeding 15%. Over the six-month period, UNI witnessed an overall decline of about 10%. Variations in these intervals point to a market with strong upward spurts and drawn-down corrections. Price fluctuations highlight inconsistent investor sentiment, with short-term optimism failing to fully offset the longer-term bearish pull. These numerical shifts indicate a market oscillating between rebound efforts and underlying weaknesses, suggesting that traders are adjusting their positions based on perceived near-term gains while navigating overall downward trends. Current trading shows UNI oscillating between a price range of roughly $6.68 to $11.87 with key levels clearly defined. The range is anchored by a solid support level at about $4 and met with resistance near $14.37, while a second, stronger resistance emerges around $19.56. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator hint at some bullish energy, yet negative momentum and an RSI hovering in the mid-40s indicate significant bearish pressure. The market lacks a strong, clear trend, resulting in a balancing act between bulls and bears. Traders might consider accumulation near support with caution, using resistance levels as potential exit points. Focusing on short-term gains while managing risk could prove beneficial during this period of alternating sentiments. Conclusion LTC and UNI are at critical points in their development. Both coins have shown potential for significant gains. However, their future value will depend on upcoming market conditions and investor confidence. LTC's performance may hinge on upcoming upgrades and increased adoption. UNI's growth will likely be influenced by the overall performance of decentralized finance. Investors should watch market trends closely as these will play a key role in the future direction of both LTC and UNI. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-04 07:46:15,49512509,1754293575,Will Bitcoin Crash On Fear Selling? Here's What Cardano And XRP Holders Should Understand,"Bitcoin’s recent volatility has sparked concerns of a steep decline as nervous traders offload their holdings. Amid this turmoil, Cardano and XRP might emerge as surprising contenders. This article delves into the market dynamics that could decide the fate of these coins, providing insights for investors on potential growth opportunities amid the uncertainty. Cardano Price Movement: Past Trends and Present Key Levels Cardano showed an 18.83% gain over the last month, rebounding after a half-year decline of 12.30%. A recent weekly drop of 13.05% underlines the choppy nature of its performance. Price movements over these periods reveal a coin that recovered in the short term despite longer-term pressure. The figures indicate varied sentiment among traders, with short-term enthusiasm contrasting with more reserved long-range expectations. The coin currently trades in a range between $0.539 and $0.938, with the nearest resistance at $1.136 and a second hurdle at $1.535. A robust support exists at $0.338, offering traders a potential cushion during dips. Indicators show a mix of signals; the Awesome Oscillator is almost neutral at 0.00341, while the Momentum Indicator leans slightly negative at -0.092. The Relative Strength Index, at 43.57, suggests a balanced outlook without one side clearly dominating. This trading range invites ideas such as setting tight stops near support and looking for a breakout above resistance. XRP Price Action: Steady Growth and Tactical Range XRP experienced a strong one‐month advance with a 25.50% increase and a moderate six‐month gain of 4.81%. A short‐term dip over the past week brought a 10.52% drop, highlighting recent volatility amid an overall upward push. The coin has managed to bounce back over the month while maintaining modest gains over the half-year, showcasing a mix of resilience and temporary weakness. Current prices are found in a tight range between $2.23 and $3.74. The first barrier for buyers lies at the resistance level of $4.45, while the nearest support is clearly at $1.43. A secondary resistance around $5.97 may test bullish strength if momentum picks up. The indicators show mixed signals with a neutral RSI at 44.28, creating a balanced field between bears and bulls with no clear trend. Trading within these levels could involve entering near support while watching for a push above $4.45 to signal a breakout. Conclusion Fear of selling might impact Bitcoin, but it's essential for ADA and XRP holders to stay focused. While short-term volatility can be challenging, it's crucial to consider the long-term potential. ADA and XRP have strong communities and unique features that differentiate them. Long-term growth depends on their development and adoption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-04 07:45:10,49511365,1754293510,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Why a Crucial Pullback Looms,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Why a Crucial Pullback Looms The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, constantly influenced by a myriad of factors. For anyone invested in Bitcoin, understanding these underlying currents is crucial. Recently, a notable observation from crypto on-chain analyst AbramChart has sparked discussions about a potential temporary correction. This isn’t about widespread panic, but rather a calculated assessment of market dynamics, particularly concerning the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs). Understanding Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Long-Term Holders Before diving into the analyst’s insights, let’s clarify who Bitcoin short-term holders and long-term holders (LTHs) are, and why their actions matter. These groups are defined by how long they hold their Bitcoin: Short-Term Holders (STHs): These are addresses that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. They are often more sensitive to price fluctuations and are quicker to realize profits or cut losses. Their trading activity can significantly impact immediate market movements. Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are addresses that have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days. LTHs are typically considered the ‘strong hands’ of the market, less likely to sell during volatility, and often accumulate during dips. Their conviction forms a foundational support for Bitcoin’s price. The distinction between these two groups is vital because their collective behavior often signals different phases of the market cycle. LTHs tend to drive bull markets through accumulation, while STHs can introduce volatility through profit-taking. What is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) Indicator? AbramChart’s analysis hinges on the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator. This powerful on-chain metric provides insight into the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market. It calculates the difference between realized profit and realized loss, normalized by the market capitalization. In simpler terms, it tells us how much unrealized profit or loss exists in the market at any given time. The NUPL indicator is particularly insightful when broken down by holder type: LTH NUPL: When LTH NUPL is high, it means long-term holders are sitting on significant unrealized profits. This often indicates a strong bull market, as LTHs are not selling. STH NUPL: When STH NUPL fluctuates at lower levels, it suggests that short-term holders are either at break-even or experiencing minor losses, or that their profits are not as substantial as LTHs. This makes them more prone to selling once prices rebound even slightly, to secure small gains or avoid further losses. Why Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders a Concern Now? According to AbramChart’s recent update on X, the LTH NUPL currently resides above 0.5, firmly in the profit zone. This reinforces the overall bullish sentiment driven by long-term conviction. However, the analyst points out that the NUPL metric for Bitcoin short-term holders is ‘fluctuating at lower levels.’ This is the key insight. Consider the following scenario: Holder Group NUPL Status Potential Behavior Long-Term Holders (LTHs) Above 0.5 (Significant Profit) Continued Holding, Market Support Short-Term Holders (STHs) Fluctuating at Lower Levels Increased Selling Pressure on Rebound This dynamic creates a situation where, even if the overall market trend remains bullish due to LTHs, any significant price rebound could trigger selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders looking to exit positions at break-even or with minimal profit. This ‘take profit’ mentality from STHs can lead to a temporary pullback, essentially a minor correction, before the broader bullish trend potentially resumes. How Does This Impact the Bitcoin Price? The immediate impact of selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders is a potential cooling-off period for the price. Imagine a car accelerating, but then hitting a small bump in the road. The bump doesn’t stop the car, but it might momentarily slow it down. Similarly, STH selling can: Create Local Resistance: As price approaches certain levels, STHs who bought at those levels (or slightly higher) might sell, creating resistance. Increase Volatility: The sudden influx of sell orders can lead to increased price swings in the short term. Offer Buying Opportunities: For long-term investors, these pullbacks often represent opportunities to accumulate more Bitcoin at a discount. It’s important to stress that this is projected as a ‘temporary pullback,’ not a market crash. The underlying strength from LTHs suggests that the overall bullish trend is still intact. However, investors should be prepared for potential short-term volatility. What Actionable Insights Can Investors Gain? Understanding the potential for a pullback from Bitcoin short-term holders allows investors to refine their strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Risk Management: If you’re a short-term trader, be mindful of your entry and exit points. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect profits or limit potential losses during a pullback. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, a temporary pullback can be an excellent opportunity to continue or start dollar-cost averaging. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price, reducing the impact of volatility. Patience and Conviction: If you’re an LTH, maintaining conviction during short-term dips is key. The analyst’s report suggests that the broader market trend remains bullish, supported by LTHs. Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics and analyst insights. The crypto market evolves rapidly, and staying updated helps in making informed decisions. Are There Any Challenges or Uncertainties? While on-chain analysis provides valuable insights, it’s not without its challenges. Market sentiment can shift quickly, and unforeseen macroeconomic events or regulatory news can override even the strongest on-chain signals. The ‘temporary’ nature of the pullback also implies a degree of uncertainty regarding its duration and depth. Predicting exact price movements is inherently difficult, and analysts provide probabilities based on observed data. Furthermore, the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders can be influenced by various factors beyond just NUPL, such as news cycles, social media sentiment, and broader financial market conditions. Therefore, while AbramChart’s analysis offers a compelling perspective, it should be considered as one piece of a larger puzzle in your investment decision-making process. Concluding Thoughts on Bitcoin Short-Term Holders The insights from analyst AbramChart highlight a crucial dynamic in the current Bitcoin market: while long-term holders provide a strong foundation for bullish momentum, the cautious positioning of Bitcoin short-term holders suggests a potential for temporary selling pressure. This isn’t a signal for alarm, but rather a call for informed awareness. Investors who understand these subtle shifts in holder behavior are better equipped to navigate the market’s ebb and flow, turning potential volatility into strategic opportunities. The market continues its fascinating dance, and staying attuned to the rhythm of its participants, especially the actions of Bitcoin short-term holders, is key to success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main takeaway from AbramChart’s analysis regarding Bitcoin short-term holders? The main takeaway is that while the overall Bitcoin market trend remains bullish due to long-term holders, there’s a likelihood of a temporary pullback. This is attributed to potential selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders who are currently at lower unrealized profit/loss levels and might sell when prices rebound. Q2: How do Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs) differ in their market impact? LTHs, holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, typically provide market stability and drive bull trends through accumulation. STHs, holding for less than 155 days, are more reactive to price changes and can cause short-term volatility or pullbacks through profit-taking or loss-cutting. Q3: What does the NUPL indicator tell us about Bitcoin short-term holders? The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator for Bitcoin short-term holders, when fluctuating at lower levels, suggests that these holders are either at break-even or have minimal profits. This makes them more inclined to sell their holdings once Bitcoin prices see even a slight rebound, leading to increased selling pressure. Q4: Should I be worried about a significant market crash based on this analysis? The analysis points to a ‘temporary pullback,’ not a significant market crash. The strong position of Long-Term Holders (LTHs) with high NUPL indicates continued underlying bullish sentiment. The expected selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders is likely to cause only short-term volatility or a minor correction. Q5: What can investors do to prepare for a potential pullback from Bitcoin short-term holders? Investors can consider strategies like risk management (e.g., setting stop-loss orders), dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to accumulate during dips, and maintaining patience and conviction if they are long-term holders. Staying informed about on-chain metrics is also crucial. Did you find this analysis on Bitcoin short-term holders insightful?

2025-08-04 07:44:34,49511253,1754293474,"Alt Season Pushed Back Or....? Here's The Essential Prices To Track For SUI, TON And DOT For Coming Weeks","Crypto investors eagerly await the next big altcoin rally, but is the wait getting longer? Key price levels for SUI , TON , and DOT may hold the answer. Discover which cryptocurrencies show promise for the coming weeks and what prices to watch to catch the next wave. Sui Coin Experiences Volatility with Fluctuating Market Sentiment Sui has shown varied performance over the recent month and half-year. Price changes indicate a bounce in the short term with a 12.29% increase in the past month, even as the six-month performance slipped by 7.07%. A steep drop of 18.34% in the past week points to recent volatility and bear pressure in the very short term. Price action over these periods reflects a coin that has seen ups and downs, confirming the patchy market sentiment and fluctuating investor confidence. Current action finds Sui trading between a low of $2.70 and a high near $4.49, with key levels playing critical roles. The nearest support sits roughly at $1.78 while resistance is seen at $5.36, and an additional level at $7.16 could restrict a move higher. Technical indicators show mixed results: the Awesome Oscillator sits slightly positive at 0.012, while the momentum indicator remains in the red at -0.317. Bulls may attempt to push the price upward if resistance is broken, whereas bears could gain control if it falls below support. Trading strategies should focus on cautious entries and exits, with buyers looking for rebounds at support and sellers targeting resistance traps. Toncoin Price Trends and Key Levels Offer Trading Opportunities Toncoin experienced a notable surge over the past month with a price increase of 26.42% and a weekly gain of 9.28%. However, the six-month period shows a decline of 11.58%. These price movements indicate a blend of rapid short-term gains and a cautious longer-term outlook. Recent advances highlight increased buyer interest, despite the overall downtrend when viewed from a broader perspective. Current prices fluctuate between $2.93 and $3.91, with key resistance around $4.28 and support near $2.34. Bulls seem to dominate as the coin approaches resistance, although the RSI sits at 68.60, suggesting overbought conditions. The absence of a clear long-term trend raises the possibility of continuing the short-term rally or retracing to support levels. Traders may look to buy near support and monitor for breaks above resistance, planning exits near $5.26 while maintaining stop-loss orders just below $2.34 for risk management. Polkadot Market Update: Mixed Signals Amid Bearish Pressure DOT past performance shows a clear downward trend over the last six months, with prices dropping by nearly 32%. Over the most recent month, the decline nearly halted with a slight change of -0.28%. The one-week performance remains weak with a decline of over 14%, suggesting that short-term recovery efforts have not yet overcome the long-term bearish pressure. Historical data points to persistent struggles, with continuous price erosion affecting overall market sentiment. Current price action is centered between a support level at about $2.44 and a key resistance level at around $5.30, while a lower support at roughly $1.01 and a higher resistance at near $6.73 provide additional trading markers. Price oscillators and momentum indicators lean towards the bearish side, and a relative strength index of 37 implies that buyers are still not in control. The bears dominate, and no clear uptrend is in place. Traders may consider looking to sell near the resistance zones and watch the support levels for potential entry points if prices dip further. Conclusion Monitoring SUI , TON , and DOT prices is crucial in the coming weeks. These coins could see significant movement and present opportunities. Keeping track of their respective trends and fluctuations may offer valuable insights. Watching these coins closely will help in making informed decisions. Staying updated on their price changes can be beneficial for anyone interested in these specific assets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-04 07:40:11,49511076,1754293211,Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Warning of Further Weakness Ahead,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Warning of Further Weakness Ahead The cryptocurrency market is once again at a critical juncture, with Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset, facing significant headwinds. Recent reports confirm a notable Bitcoin price drop , as BTC has slipped below the crucial $112,000 support level that it had managed to hold for several weeks. This development has sent ripples of concern across the investor community, signaling a potential shift towards a more pronounced bearish outlook. For anyone tracking digital asset trends, understanding the forces behind this downturn is paramount, as it reflects a complex interplay of technical indicators and broader economic realities. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Drop Below $112,000? The recent dip in Bitcoin’s value is not an isolated event but rather a confluence of several factors, as highlighted by crypto services provider Matrixport. Their recent update on X (formerly Twitter) pinpointed the breach of the $112,000 support as a key indicator of increasing bearish sentiment. This level was a psychological and technical benchmark for many traders and investors. Its failure suggests a weakening of buyer conviction and a potential capitulation among those who held out hope for a quick rebound. The initial break of such a significant support level often triggers automated sell orders and prompts further re-evaluation of positions across the market, contributing to the accelerating Bitcoin price drop . One significant contributing factor, often overlooked by those new to the market, is the typical August seasonality. Historically, August has often presented challenges for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is sometimes attributed to lower trading volumes during summer holidays, which can amplify price movements, or simply a cyclical pattern observed over several years. This year appears to be no exception, with the seasonal pattern coinciding with renewed macroeconomic uncertainty, creating a particularly challenging environment for cryptocurrencies. The macroeconomic landscape plays a pivotal role in shaping investor sentiment and capital flows. Recent weaker U.S. labor data, specifically indicators suggesting a cooling job market, has fueled concerns about the health of the global economy. Such data points often lead economists and investors to anticipate shifts in monetary policy. This current situation draws parallels to last year’s unexpected Federal Reserve rate cut, which also significantly impacted market sentiment and led to a broader de-risking trend across financial markets. Currently, the market has priced in two potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with the first likely anticipated as early as September. Such aggressive monetary policy adjustments, particularly those driven by underlying economic weakness rather than strength, tend to exert considerable pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin. Investors become more cautious, prioritizing capital preservation and seeking safer havens over speculative growth assets. Until a clear and sustained path to economic recovery becomes evident, this pressure is expected to persist, potentially leading to further weakness in the Bitcoin price drop narrative and broader market corrections. Understanding Bearish Sentiment and its Impact on the Bitcoin Price Drop When market analysts refer to “bearish sentiment,” they are describing a prevailing negative outlook among investors, where the expectation is that asset prices will fall. This sentiment can become a self-fulfilling prophecy; as fear and uncertainty spread, they lead to increased selling pressure, pushing prices lower. For Bitcoin, this means a reduced appetite for risk, with investors potentially liquidating existing positions or delaying new investments until more clarity emerges. The collective fear can outweigh positive news, leading to prolonged periods of decline or stagnation. The impact of deeply entrenched bearish sentiment extends beyond just immediate price depreciation. It can lead to a cascade of effects throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Decreased Trading Volume: As uncertainty mounts and prices fall, many investors may choose to sit on the sidelines, leading to significantly lower trading volumes. This reduced liquidity can amplify price swings, making the market more volatile and unpredictable. Increased Volatility: Even minor news or data releases can trigger sharp price movements, both up and down, as the market reacts nervously. This heightened volatility makes it challenging for short-term traders and can be unsettling for long-term holders. Flight to Safety: During periods of significant risk aversion, capital often flows out of volatile assets like cryptocurrencies and into more traditional safe-haven assets such as gold, government bonds, or even cash. This rebalancing act further contributes to the selling pressure on digital assets. Reduced Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors, often bound by stricter risk mandates, may pause or significantly reduce their crypto exposure during periods of heightened bearishness. Their absence of buying power can remove a crucial support for prices. Negative News Cycle Reinforcement: A falling market often generates more negative news headlines, which in turn can reinforce bearish sentiment, creating a feedback loop that is difficult to break. The current environment, marked by the ongoing Bitcoin price drop , suggests a period where extreme caution is warranted. The market is processing not just crypto-specific news but also broader economic signals, regulatory shifts, and geopolitical tensions, making it a particularly complex landscape to navigate for even seasoned investors. What Key Factors Will Influence Bitcoin’s Near-Term Outlook? The path forward for Bitcoin is shaped by a variety of interconnected factors, both internal to the crypto market and external from the global economy. Monitoring these elements can provide investors with a clearer picture of potential future movements and help in anticipating whether the Bitcoin price drop will deepen or reverse course. Here are some critical factors to consider: Macroeconomic Data Releases: Upcoming U.S. labor reports (e.g., non-farm payrolls, unemployment rates), inflation figures (Consumer Price Index – CPI, Producer Price Index – PPI), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates will be closely watched. Stronger-than-expected data could alleviate some concerns about a recession, potentially boosting risk appetite. Conversely, continued weakness could intensify bearish pressure on all risk assets, including Bitcoin. Federal Reserve Monetary Policy: The timing and magnitude of any interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will be a major determinant. While rate cuts typically aim to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper, if they are perceived as a desperate reaction to severe economic weakness, they might initially signal further trouble for risk assets rather than a green light for rallies. The Fed’s forward guidance and statements from its officials will be scrutinized for clues about future policy. Global Geopolitical Events: Unforeseen global events, such as new conflicts, significant political instability in major economies, or trade disputes, can profoundly impact investor confidence. These events often trigger a “flight to safety,” where capital moves out of riskier assets and into more stable ones, directly affecting the Bitcoin price drop trajectory. Regulatory Developments: While not the primary driver of the immediate price drop, ongoing discussions and potential new regulations in major economies (e.g., the U.S., EU) could influence market sentiment and institutional participation in the crypto space. Clearer regulatory frameworks could attract more institutional capital long-term, but restrictive or uncertain regulations could deter it. On-Chain Metrics and Whale Activity: Analyzing data directly from the Bitcoin blockchain, such as transaction volumes, active addresses, mining difficulty, and large holder (whale) movements, can offer unique insights into underlying network health and investor behavior. Significant outflows from exchanges, indicating a preference for self-custody, or large accumulation by whales at lower prices could signal a potential bottom or a shift in market dynamics. Market Sentiment Indicators: Tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, social media sentiment analysis, and funding rates on derivatives exchanges can provide a real-time pulse of investor psychology. Extreme fear, paradoxically, can sometimes signal a potential reversal point, as it suggests capitulation. Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst the Bitcoin Price Drop Navigating a period of a significant Bitcoin price drop requires a strategic and disciplined approach. While past performance is not indicative of future results, understanding market dynamics and adopting a well-thought-out investment strategy can help mitigate risks and potentially identify opportunities for the long term. Strategy Description Potential Benefit/Challenge Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations. This strategy averages out the purchase price over time. Benefit: Reduces the risk of trying to “time the market” and can lead to a lower average cost basis during a downturn. Challenge: May miss out on rapid rallies if prices suddenly reverse, and requires consistent capital allocation. Robust Risk Management Implementing strict stop-loss orders for trades, only investing capital one can genuinely afford to lose, and maintaining a diversified portfolio. Benefit: Limits potential losses during sharp declines and protects capital. Challenge: Can trigger premature exits in highly volatile markets, potentially missing a rebound. Portfolio Diversification Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ethereum, stablecoins) and potentially other asset classes (e.g., traditional stocks, bonds, real estate). Benefit: Reduces concentration risk specific to Bitcoin and can provide stability if other assets perform better. Challenge: Requires thorough research into multiple assets and may dilute potential high returns from a single asset. Maintaining a Long-Term Perspective Focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition, its adoption curve, and its role as a decentralized digital asset over a multi-year horizon, rather than reacting to short-term price swings. Benefit: Less susceptible to emotional decisions driven by daily fluctuations; aligns with the growth potential of disruptive technologies. Challenge: Requires significant patience, strong conviction, and the ability to withstand substantial drawdowns. It is crucial to conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor, especially given the inherent volatility and speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. The current market conditions, characterized by the Bitcoin price drop , underscore the importance of having a well-thought-out strategy rather than reacting impulsively to daily price movements or relying solely on news headlines. Understanding your risk tolerance and investment goals is fundamental before making any financial decisions in this dynamic space. The breaking of the $112,000 support level for Bitcoin is a significant technical event that confirms a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. Driven by typical August seasonality and renewed macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly weaker U.S. labor data and anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, risk assets like BTC are under considerable pressure. While the outlook remains cautious until economic recovery becomes more evident, understanding these underlying factors allows investors to approach the market with informed strategies. This period of weakness, while challenging, also highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the constant interplay between digital assets and broader economic forces. Investors who remain informed and disciplined are better positioned to navigate these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Bitcoin’s price dropping below $112,000 significant? A1: The $112,000 level served as a key support, meaning buyers historically stepped in at this price. A sustained break below it signals a weakening of buyer confidence and could indicate further downside potential, confirming a bearish outlook. Q2: How do macroeconomic factors influence the Bitcoin price drop? A2: Macroeconomic factors like U.S. labor data, inflation, and interest rate policies directly impact investor sentiment. Weak economic data or anticipated rate cuts (especially if driven by economic weakness) can lead investors to pull out of riskier assets like Bitcoin and seek safer investments, causing prices to fall. Q3: Is August seasonality a real factor for crypto prices? A3: While not a guarantee, historical data suggests that August can be a challenging month for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This seasonality is often attributed to factors like lower trading volumes during summer holidays, which can amplify price movements, or simply a recurring market pattern. Q4: What should investors do during a period of Bitcoin price drop? A4: During a downturn, strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), robust risk management (e.g., setting stop-losses, only investing what you can afford to lose), and portfolio diversification can be beneficial. Maintaining a long-term perspective and conducting thorough personal research are also crucial. Q5: Will the Federal Reserve’s potential rate cuts help or hurt Bitcoin? A5: The impact is complex. While rate cuts typically aim to stimulate the economy, if they are seen as a reaction to severe economic weakness, they might initially signal further trouble for risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors become more cautious. The market’s interpretation of the reason for the cuts is key. Did you find this analysis on the recent Bitcoin price drop insightful?

2025-08-04 07:39:00,49511974,1754293140,Best $0.035 crypto this August may deliver 900% gains before ETH regains ATH,"Mutuum’s ecosystem is built for long-term use, not just hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t another meme-fueled pump and dump. Its strength lies in the functional economy it is building—a system where both borrowers and lenders can participate in a scalable, efficient, and transparent way. The entire platform is anchored by mtTokens, which are issued when users deposit stablecoins or other supported assets into the lending pool. These mtTokens automatically increase in value based on interest earned from borrowers. But the ecosystem goes further. mtTokens can also be staked in smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards, creating a feedback loop where protocol activity generates real returns. Revenue from loan activity is designed to fund protocol-led buybacks of MUTM tokens from the open market and return to the mtToken stakers, boosting long-term demand and value without needing to artificially deflate supply. One of the biggest competitive advantages is the upcoming Layer-2 integration, which will allow the platform to function with dramatically lower gas fees and faster speeds. That’s a game changer in DeFi, where congested Layer-1 networks have often turned away users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to eliminate that friction and improve user retention by making borrowing and lending smoother, cheaper, and accessible at scale. Alongside its smart contract lending pools, the platform is preparing to introduce a fully decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin, engineered to maintain a $1 peg. Rather than arbitrary inflation, minting of this stablecoin will only occur when a loan is issued, and tokens will be burned on repayment, ensuring a tightly controlled supply. Combined with Layer-2 speed and reduced costs, this stablecoin could quickly become one of the most attractive options in the DeFi space. Adding to its upcoming releases is a dual-model structure. The P2C (peer-to-contract) lending model will automatically match borrowers and lenders from shared liquidity pools. Here, lenders will earn APY based on pool utilization, while borrowers can access loans with overcollateralization, such as putting up $10,000 in ETH to borrow $6,500 in stablecoins at a stable rate. For users looking for direct deals, the P2P (peer-to-peer) model will offer negotiated terms, particularly useful for trading higher-risk memecoins or NFT-based assets. Rising demand before the next presale hike The project’s social momentum is equally strong, boasting over 12,000 Twitter followers and a fully detailed four-phase roadmap. Investors are also eyeing the ongoing $100,000 giveaway , which will see 10 winners receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens—further fueling community buzz and participation. This event, alongside the upcoming staking programs, is expected to increase wallet count and accelerate token distribution across new wallets. With over $13.85 million already raised, and 7% of Phase 6’s 170 million token allocation sold, the token’s growing traction speaks for itself. More than 14,800 holders are already onboard, and with the price set to increase by 15% in Phase 7—from $0.035 to $0.040—the window for early accumulation is rapidly narrowing. At launch, the listing price will be $0.06. But market projections already foresee significantly higher valuations driven by real-world usage. Rigorous security audit Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also undergone a rigorous security audit with CertiK, delivering a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. The audit process included both manual code review and automated vulnerability scanning, with the most recent updates logged in May 2025. That, coupled with a $50,000 bug bounty in collaboration with CertiK, reinforces confidence in the platform’s security-first approach. A Phase 2 buyer who swapped just 10 ETH at $3,000 into MUTM when the token was priced at $0.015 would now be sitting on 2 million tokens. When the token hits $2 next year—a target many analysts see as achievable based on product delivery and protocol revenue—that’s a $4 million return on a $30,000 input. This is the kind of upside ETH investors dreamt of in its early days. While Ethereum (ETH) continues its slow grind back to previous highs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a rare opportunity to move ahead of the market. With price, product, and momentum all aligning, this may very well be the best $0.035 opportunity DeFi has delivered in 2025.

The proposal passed with 74% in favor and authorizes the disbursement of 96 million ADA, or roughly 13% of the protocol’s treasury, to IOG. Payments will be milestone-based and overseen by Intersect, a member-driven governance body. Smart contracts and an independent committee will add additional oversight, IOG said. Key deliverables include Hydra, a layer-2 scaling product for faster and cheaper transactions, and Project Acropolis, which aims to re-architect the Cardano node for greater modularity and ease of developer onboarding. The team also plans to reduce memory usage and improve operational costs for validators. Such implementations can eventually lead to increased developer activity and new use cases on the Cardano network, contributing to demand for ADA, the network’s gas token. The proposal, which has been under discussion since the start of the year, faced a degree of opposition, with some critics arguing that it lacked granular breakdowns and questioned whether it should have been split into smaller, individually voted items. A rival proposal by Cardano’s Technical Steering Committee was ultimately rejected despite gaining early traction. Rival chains are also pushing ahead with upgrades.

2025-08-04 07:30:52,49510790,1754292652,DeepSeek ADA Price Prediction: 2025–2030,"Cardano (ADA) continues to attract attention as one of the most actively developed layer-1 blockchains, and DeepSeek AI’s latest forecast paints an optimistic future for the token. The new projections highlight ADA’s potential to deliver solid returns for long-term holders, especially as the network’s scalability upgrades and ecosystem growth begin to gain traction. Meanwhile, as retail traders scan the markets for early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing a wave of investor momentum. The project has just recorded a new all-time high in daily participation, suggesting that fresh capital is actively rotating into emerging assets with strong community backing. DeepSeek’s Outlook for ADA DeepSeek’s AI-driven model estimates that Cardano could trade between $1.80 and $2.30 by the end of 2025, fueled by improved network efficiency and growing adoption of Hydra, its scaling solution. Looking further out, the model projects ADA reaching $4.00 to $6.50 in 2027, provided DeFi and identity applications continue to develop on-chain. By 2030, DeepSeek sees Cardano potentially climbing into the $9.00 to $13.00 range. This projection relies on macroeconomic tailwinds, expanded regulatory clarity, and widespread institutional use of the network for real-world utilities such as education, supply chain tracking, and digital ID systems. A Newcomer with Fast-Moving Potential While ADA offers a steady long-term growth path, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting short-term buzz for its breakout momentum. With daily investor sign-ups hitting record highs, the project is gaining ground among those seeking to enter early, before major exchange listings kick in. Momentum-driven traders are pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few altcoins showing explosive potential right now, with some predicting that its current phase could mirror the early-stage breakout patterns seen in previous cycles. Cardano’s Core Strengths Remain Cardano’s development team, led by IOHK, has remained focused on slow, research-based improvements. Initiatives like Mithril and the Midnight sidechain are seen as key additions that will boost both scalability and privacy in the years ahead. Importantly, Cardano’s proof-of-stake model continues to attract environmentally conscious investors and developers, especially as regulations around energy usage tighten. Conclusion DeepSeek AI’s ADA forecast offers a long-term bullish case, grounded in Cardano’s commitment to scalability, decentralization, and real-world use cases. But for those seeking quicker upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s surge in user participation suggests that it may be the breakout altcoin of the moment. As 2025 unfolds, keeping an eye on both could prove to be a smart strategy.

2025-08-04 07:30:16,49510724,1754292616,"Dogecoin Just Hit A Prime Risk-Reward Entry, Says Analyst","The Dogecoin weekly chart is back at a cluster of technical levels that one market watcher says offers a favorable entry. The pseudonymous trader Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) posted a TradingView snapshot and wrote, “I bought a little bit more DOGE and Fartcoin last night, but you pretty much knew that. I think it’s great risk-reward here and that I’ll do what I can to buy anyway.” In a follow-up note attached to the same chart, the analyst summarized the setup as a “DOGE Bull market support band back-test. Diagonal bear market trendline breakout and back-test.” Best Dogecoin Buy Signal? The chart, created August 3,, tracks DOGE/USD (Coinbase) on the weekly timeframe and shows price pulling into the Bull Market Support Band—an envelope indicator plotted as two lines—now marked around $0.19025–$0.20703. At the time of the screenshot, the weekly candle displayed O: $0.24076, H: $0.24860, L: $0.18855, C: $0.19945, reflecting a drop of roughly 17.15% on the week with hours left in the session. The drawdown follows a sharp two-week advance that pushed Dogecoin into the upper $0.20s before sellers faded the move. Technically, the image highlights two elements beyond the support band. First is a descending trendline drawn across lower weekly highs, which price moved above on July 16 and is now testing from the topside. Second is the confluence between that trendline and the bull market support band, a zone that trend followers often watch to judge whether a breakout is holding or failing. Related Reading: Historical Data Predicts Dogecoin Price Crash In August — But There’s A Silver Lining The analyst’s post frames the current retreat as a “back-test” of both features rather than a breakdown, implying that demand near the band could keep bulls in control if the level continues to act as support. While the post is explicitly bullish, the evidence presented is descriptive rather than predictive. However, the weekly candle has closed above the crucial area. So, the configuration is clear: after piercing a long-running diagonal barrier, DOGE is revisiting the $0.19–$0.21 area, where the support band is aligned with the former downtrend line. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Loses This Level, Expect A Major Crash: Analyst Warns Traders who subscribe to momentum-and-trend methodologies often evaluate such retests for confirmation—looking for stabilization, shrinking downside momentum, or a swift recovery back above the midline of the band. Cantonese Cat’s message distills that view into a simple risk stance. By stating “I think it’s great risk-reward here,” the commentator is signaling that, in his opinion, the nearby technical levels define risk tightly relative to potential upside should the breakout sustain. As always, that is one analyst’s interpretation of the chart at a specific moment in time; Dogecoin remains volatile, and this week will be pivotal for bulls attempting to confirm the momentum, but the risk-reward ratio seems quite good.

2025-08-04 07:30:05,49511081,1754292605,Trump floats tariff dividend for middle and lower income Americans,"US President Donald Trump suggested that middle and lower-income Americans might receive some form of dividend from the tariff revenue. Until now, most US companies have shouldered the tariff cost burden rather than passing it on to consumers. But the latest inflation numbers suggest that might be starting to change, with the rise in consumer prices. Just before boarding Air Force One after leaving his golf club in New Jersey, Trump told reporters , “There could be a distribution or a dividend to the people of our country, I would say for people that would be middle-income people and lower-income people, we could do a dividend.” According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the tariffs have already brought in $100 billion for the US and could generate as much as $300 billion annually. Trump said they were considering rebate checks earlier Nearly two weeks ago, Trump said his administration was considering sending rebate checks to Americans, funded by tariff revenue. He mentioned that the payments might be targeted at “people of a certain income level,” though he didn’t specify the threshold. At the time, however, he emphasized that while the rebate plan was on the table, the administration’s top priority was reducing the national debt. Currently, the US federal debt stands at over $36 trillion , which analysts believe will only rise, especially due to the new tax cuts and spending package enacted by Trump on July 4. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the Big Beautiful Bill Act could inject $3.4 trillion into the federal deficit in the next ten years. In February, Trump had initially floated the idea of rebate checks, noting that a portion—specifically 20%—of the savings generated by Elon Musk’s cost-cutting initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), could be used for direct taxpayer payments. However, to issue rebates, Congress would have to pass legislation granting the Treasury Department the authority to send out payments. The White House extended its deadline to August 7 Trump has slapped levies on most of America’s trading partners to correct the trade imbalance . In April, the US President first announced “reciprocal tariffs,” which had immediate global repercussions, with stock markets plummeting and investor confidence shaken. Trump then opted to delay the full implementation of tariffs, imposing a 90-day moratorium and applying a baseline rate of 10%. This pause provided an opportunity for negotiations with the federal government. Originally due to expire on July 9, the moratorium was extended to August 1, allowing several nations to reach agreements with the U.S. However, the White House has once again pushed back the deadline, giving countries until August 7 to negotiate. Inu Manak, a trade policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said many nations are likely to use the extra time to try to strike better tariff terms. She pointed out that those facing steep tariffs—15% or more—particularly, have a real incentive to come to the discussion table. So far, the Trump administration has managed to strike deals with countries like Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, and the European Union. Get seen where it counts.

2025-08-03 21:30:03,49486056,1754256603,"ETH Steals Bitcoin’s Spotlight as ETFs Explode—Could XRP, Solana, and Sui Investors Shift to This 12,000% ROI  Altcoin?","Ethereum (ETH) has stolen the limelight from Bitcoin (BTC), drawing unprecedented institutional attention with a massive influx into Ethereum ETFs. Last week alone, Ethereum ETFs attracted over $2.2 billion in inflows—marking one of the largest institutional movements into any cryptocurrency product this year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs witnessed minimal action, leading many market participants to question if Ethereum’s moment in the sun is truly here. But the crypto narrative is always shifting, and savvy investors holding positions in major altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and now Sui (SUI) are already looking beyond ETH. According to analysts, there’s one particular altcoin quietly gaining momentum with potential returns of up to 12,000% : MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum’s ETF Surge: Why Institutions Are Dumping BTC Ethereum ETFs have surged amid growing institutional adoption, marking an unprecedented shift away from Bitcoin-focused funds. The figures speak volumes: Ethereum ETFs saw a record $2.2 billion inflow in one week. Digital asset funds have achieved 14 consecutive weeks of inflows. Ethereum-based institutional products now total over $220 billion in assets under management. Ethereum’s appeal lies in its active and evolving DeFi ecosystem, combined with clearer regulatory frameworks, making ETH an attractive bet for traditional financial institutions. But while ETH has managed to eclipse Bitcoin in recent weeks, market experts suggest even more aggressive ROI opportunities lie beyond Ethereum, in rapidly emerging altcoins. XRP, Solana, and Sui Investors Eyeing Bigger Gains Despite XRP’s recent bullish performance— trading around $3.14 —and Solana hovering at $179.90 , both face inherent limitations: XRP continues to grapple with regulatory uncertainty despite bullish ETF rumors. Solana (SOL) has institutional backing but faces competition from newer Layer-1 chains like Aptos and Sui . Sui, while gaining attention as a next-generation chain, still struggles with early-stage volatility and user traction. As institutional focus intensifies on Ethereum ETFs, crypto investors traditionally loyal to XRP, SOL, and SUI are now actively seeking projects that can offer higher exponential returns in shorter periods. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Quietly Attracting Whales Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE —a new altcoin capturing investor attention with bold predictions of returns reaching up to 12,000% . With its unique blend of political symbolism and robust DeFi mechanics, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly carved out a niche as a high-potential investment. Here’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is on analysts’ watchlists: Deflationary Economics: MAGACOIN FINANCE employs a scarcity-driven token model, with regular burns reducing circulating supply and increasing token value. Institutional Audits: Already HashEx-audited with a CertiK audit underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides investor confidence amid a turbulent market environment. Staking Utility Live from Day One: Unlike competitors such as Bitcoin Hyper, MAGACOIN FINANCE has launched with immediate DeFi functionalities including staking, governance voting, and community reward programs. While Ethereum ETF growth underscores institutional appetite, investors looking for explosive returns are increasingly pivoting to newer, riskier assets with massive upside—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is firmly positioned at the front of this new wave. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Be the Next Big Crypto Winner? Crypto market veterans know that timing is everything. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive early-stage growth, combined with institutional-grade auditing and unique DeFi integrations, positions it as one of 2025’s potential breakout stories . Early analysts have openly compared MAGACOIN’s current trajectory to historic meme-coin successes like Shiba Inu and early-stage Pepecoin—both famously delivering life-changing gains for their early backers. As Ethereum ETFs dominate headlines, behind-the-scenes whale movements indicate a clear shift toward altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, hinting that the smart money is quietly accumulating positions before wider market discovery. Bottom Line: Why Investors Should Act Now Ethereum ETFs’ record-breaking inflows show that institutional money is hungry for crypto exposure, yet the largest ROI opportunities remain in high-upside altcoins. With analysts predicting MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver returns upwards of 12,000% , it’s little wonder why seasoned investors from XRP, Solana, and Sui communities are pivoting to capture this potentially explosive upside. The crypto market’s next significant opportunity may not be Ethereum or Bitcoin—but an altcoin like MAGACOIN FINANCE , already on the radar of savvy investors and poised for a monumental breakout.

2025-08-03 21:21:24,49485642,1754256084,Ethereum Price Prediction: Post-Rally 13% Drop – Is ETH Eyeing Deeper Correction or New Highs?,"Ethereum’s latest retreat, a 13% drop from recent highs, marks its first weekly loss in over a month, breaking a steady uptrend that saw ETH testing multi-week highs. The correction, which briefly dragged prices below $3,400, has sparked debate: Is this a pause before a breakout, or the start of a more profound decline? A fascinating counter-narrative has emerged: a whale bought $300 million of ETH , indicating they believe this dip is temporary. Someone is playing big on $ETH . Instead of bloodbath whale loading their bags with only ETH. In the last 3 days, he purchased $300M ETH from Galaxy Digital OTC. What a confidence, zero hesitation. Now, its current worth $264M is currently down 8.7%. While you are selling,… pic.twitter.com/iHUTRAuNKH — Henry (@LordOfAlts) August 3, 2025 On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows the massive purchase happened as prices were dropping – a “buy the dip” strategy from a high-conviction entity. This, as the broader market is reeling from macro pressures: a strong US dollar and weak non-farm payroll data, which triggered risk-off sentiment. ETH price drop : -13% from July highs Whale purchase : $300 million in ETH Market cap : $422B Trading volume : $28.8B (past 24h) This divergence between price action and whale behavior suggests a potential reversal. While many traders are exiting on fear, the aggressive accumulation indicates a medium to long-term recovery outlook. It also comes as Ethereum is an institutional asset tied to upcoming ETFs and on-chain upgrades. Ethereum (ETH) Price Tests Critical Zones Ethereum price prediction is turning bullish as ETH is trying to recover from $3,374 – its lowest since early July. Price is testing the 0.236 Fib at $3,491, a level that was both support and resistance before. A clean break above this could lead to $3,564 (38.2% Fib) and $3,623 (50%), with ultimate recovery at $3,681 (61.8%), which is also the 50-period SMA at $3,711. #Ethereum Price Prediction ETH bounces from $3,374 support but faces major resistance at $3,564 (Fib 38.2%). RSI still weak at 39.5. Watch: Break above $3,681 = bullish continuation Rejection = drop to $3,267 likely Whale bought $300M ETH – confidence or trap? #ETH #Crypto pic.twitter.com/S7h4jBgF32 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 3, 2025 Momentum is still weak. The 4-hour RSI is at 39, just below the 50 neutral zone. Without bullish divergence or volume confirmation, the price may stall at resistance. A reversal candle (bullish engulfing) above $3,564 would add to the recovery. But rejection at $3,491 or $3,564 would be bearish and could drag ETH back to $3,374 or even $3,267. Ethereum Trade Outlook: Watch the $3,564 Breakout If ETH breaks above $3,564 with volume and a bullish candlestick, traders can target $3,681 and $3,765. This is Fibonacci and historical resistance, a high probability setup.

2025-08-03 21:05:04,49484982,1754255104,"XRP Has Formed Golden Entry, Analyst Says This Is Your Final Chance to Get Rich","Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has ignited fresh excitement across the XRP community by identifying what he calls a “Golden Entry” on the monthly chart. This is a rare technical pattern that historically preceded explosive price action. According to him, this could be investors’ final opportunity to accumulate XRP before a major breakout, echoing the asset’s legendary 2017 bull run. Echoes of 2017: History May Be Repeating In a striking side-by-side comparison, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlights XRP’s current monthly chart structure and compares it to the 2017 cycle. Back then, XRP formed a symmetrical triangle before breaking out and skyrocketing from below $0.01 to an all-time high of $3.84 in just a few months. #XRP HAS FORMED THE GOLDEN ENTRY! This is your final chance to get rich. pic.twitter.com/w6xJgKH4TL — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 That triangle pattern—marked by narrowing price action followed by a powerful breakout—was what the analyst termed the “Golden Entry.” Now, in 2025, XRP appears to be replicating that exact formation. After a strong rally that began in late 2024, XRP entered a months-long consolidation phase just below $3.50. As of report time, the asset has broken out of that triangle pattern, confirming what the analyst sees as another “Golden Entry” moment, potentially signaling the start of a major upward move. XRP Price Update: Breakout Confirmed XRP is currently trading at $2.90. The breakout from the consolidation triangle has now been confirmed on the monthly time frame, with the August candle showing strong bullish momentum. Crucially, XRP has reclaimed the $2.95–$3.00 zone, a key resistance range that has repeatedly stalled previous rallies. With this barrier now broken , traders are eyeing a push toward $3.50, followed by a possible surge to $5.00 and beyond. If the current pattern continues as it did in 2017, analysts believe a move to $10 or higher is within reach. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Fundamentals Support the Rally XRP’s bullish momentum isn’t just technical—it’s also being driven by expanding ecosystem developments and rising institutional interest. Ripple’s launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD, in December 2024 has brought new liquidity and real-world utility to the XRP Ledger. Additionally, the expected deployment of FXRP, which enables trustless bridging between XRP and other networks, such as Flare, is generating further excitement. While some concerns were raised after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold $200 million worth of XRP in July, market sentiment remains firmly bullish. Trading volumes have increased, and technical indicators are flashing green across multiple time frames. Golden Moment or Missed Opportunity? Skeptics may brush off the “Golden Entry” as overhyped, but the technical signals and historical parallels are difficult to ignore. XRP has broken out of a textbook triangle formation on the monthly chart, just as it did before its explosive rally in 2017. If this setup repeats, the upside potential could be substantial. According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, this may very well be the last chance for investors to enter before XRP embarks on its next major leg up.

2025-08-03 21:00:47,49484919,1754254847,Crypto Capital Rotation: XRP Investors Eye New Altcoin With High Growth Potential,"As XRP continues to move sideways, many investors are beginning to pivot toward opportunities with higher near-term potential. Altcoin interest is surging again, and one project in particular—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is beginning to draw serious attention from traders looking for stronger momentum plays. XRP Fails to Break Key Levels XRP has held steady around the $3 mark for weeks, showing resilience but little upside action. Even as large wallets continue to accumulate and network usage grows, the lack of a breakout is leaving short-term traders frustrated. While long-term prospects remain intact, there’s growing demand for tokens with faster growth potential and more immediate returns. Early Investors Are Targeting the Next Big Opportunity That appetite for action has triggered a rush toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new player that recently saw its presale round close faster than expected. Now entering its next funding wave, the project is generating FOMO across crypto channels. Analysts are pointing to a potential 5,000% return , noting that even a small investment could grow into a fortune. The hype isn’t just talk—community numbers are growing, and early backers are comparing this moment to the breakout phases of past meme coin legends. Traders Grow Restless as XRP Lacks Catalysts Back on the XRP front, hopes are still pinned on regulatory clarity and a potential ETF listing—but timelines are uncertain. Some are holding, but others are clearly moving funds into faster-developing projects. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP isn’t delivering the action many traders are chasing right now, and attention is drifting. Conclusion XRP may still see its moment, but right now, capital is flowing to altcoins with stronger short-term upside. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid presale and 5,000% ROI prediction, it’s clear which way momentum is shifting. For investors who don’t want to miss the next breakout, early positioning is everything.

2025-08-03 21:00:00,1703334,1754254800,"Ethereum price prediction 2025-2031: Will ETH reach $5,000 soon?","Key takeaways Ethereum price prediction suggests an average market price of $4,688 by the end of 2025. In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $14,529 and $17,204, with an average expected price of $14,949 In 2031, ETH could trade between $45,184 and $51,567 with an average price of $46,747. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $3,465 Market cap $418.47B Trading volume (24-hour) $28.43B Circulating supply 120.71M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $3,515.43 24-hour low $3,357.94 ET price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 14.41% 50-day SMA $2,991.37 200-day SMA $2,458 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green days 20/30 (67%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis ETH daily chart signals fading momentum below $3,600 with RSI cooling from overbought territory 4-hour chart shows sideways consolidation around $3,460 amid weak MACD and bearish balance of power Bulls need to break $3,600 to resume the rally or risk retesting lower bands near $3,300 Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum Holds $3,260 Support as Bulls Eye Recovery Toward $3,627 Based on the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) on Aug 3, the price has recently pulled back from its peak near $4,200 and is now consolidating around the $3,460 mark. The RSI has cooled to 52.49, indicating a transition out of overbought conditions, while the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, hinting at weakening momentum. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The Bollinger Bands are wide but starting to contract slightly, suggesting reduced volatility. Support is currently near $3,260, while resistance lies around $3,627. If buyers fail to regain strength above the midline, Ethereum may continue to range sideways or revisit support. Reversal signals remain inconclusive without volume confirmation. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: “Ethereum Struggles to Reclaim Mid-Band Support as $3,460 Holds the Line Based on the 4-hour Ethereum chart, the recent price action reflects a continuation of bearish correction from the $3,880 region, with current consolidation near $3,460. The Bollinger Bands show price stabilizing near the lower band, suggesting oversold conditions might be easing. ETHUSD chart by TradingView However, the MACD remains deeply in negative territory at -3.28 with no bullish crossover in sight, and the Balance of Power reading of -0.44 indicates sellers still control momentum. Unless ETH closes above the 20-SMA near $3,567 with volume confirmation, further downside toward $3,307 support is likely. Caution is warranted until a stronger bullish reversal pattern is confirmed. ETH technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2,952.26 BUY SMA 5 3,356.45 BUY SMA 10 3,567.51 SELL SMA 21 3,540.58 SELL SMA 50 2,991.37 BUY SMA 100 2,693.71 BUY SMA 200 2,458.00 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3,370.71 BUY EMA 5 3,131.23 BUY EMA 10 2,762.85 BUY EMA 21 2,414.35 BUY EMA 50 2,288.06 BUY EMA 100 2,455.35 BUY EMA 200 2,665.39 BUY What to expect from ETH price analysis next? Based on the 1-day and 4-hour ETH/USD charts, Ethereum shows signs of short-term stabilization but remains technically vulnerable. On the daily chart, ETH has pulled back from the $4,000 region and is hovering near the 20-day SMA at $3,627.03, with the RSI falling from overbought levels around 72.56 to a more neutral 52.49. This suggests a cooling-off phase with potential for either a bounce or further downside. On the 4-hour chart, price is consolidating around $3,460, beneath the middle Bollinger Band. Momentum indicators remain bearish, implying that bulls must reclaim $3,600 to avoid deeper corrections toward $3,300. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,019 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $36,694 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,133 and a high of $11,875. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,866. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $51,567 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum Ethereum Celebrates 10 Years as DeFi’s Foundation Ethereum marks its 10th anniversary, transforming from a visionary whitepaper into the backbone of decentralized finance. Since its launch, Ethereum has enabled billions in value to move seamlessly across a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. The transition to proof-of-stake following The Merge has established staking as a core network feature, attracting over one million validators who now secure the network. Institutions increasingly choose platforms like Figment to stake, citing non-custodial options, SOC 2 Type II compliance, robust MEV policies, and audit-ready reporting. As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to shape an open, secure financial future. 🎉 @ethereum turns 10!

2025-08-03 20:52:52,49485149,1754254372,A Bitcoin whale opened a $45M 40x long that liquidates at $105K,"A whale just placed a massive Bitcoin bet, $45 million worth, with 40x leverage, according to data from Coinglass. The trade was opened with a liquidation line at $105,000, and if Bitcoin hits $125,000, it’ll trigger $5.6 billion in short liquidations, most of which are clustered near $121,000. At press time, Bitcoin is trading just above $114,000, which puts the whale’s stop-loss level only a few thousand dollars away. But while some short-term traders are sweating it out, long-term holders aren’t budging. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for Long-Term Holders (LTH) remains above 0.5, meaning they’re still sitting comfortably in profit. These holders are showing no signs of panic, unlike Short-Term Holders (STH), who are now stuck deciding whether to sell at a loss or hold on in underwater positions. STH wallets are lingering close to breakeven and are contributing to sell pressure during every minor price rally, per data from CryptoQuant. Selloff on Binance reveals where longs got wiped On August 1, Binance’s cumulative net taker volume dropped sharply, falling past -$1 billion and crashing to -$1.5 billion, levels not seen since July 25. That metric tracks the difference between aggressive buys and sells, and a deep negative print means the sellers were in full control. The decline came right after a liquidation that wiped out long positions around $114,000, with a heatmap on Coinglass showing a cluster of liquidations hitting that level, likely from traders who bought into the previous rebound and got caught when the trend reversed. Also, around the same time, funding rates across Binance, Bitmex, and Deribit all dipped into negative territory, meaning more people started opening shorts, expecting Bitcoin to fall further. These zones are often referred to as “cold zones” in trading circles, times when traders become heavily tilted toward one side of the book, in this case, shorts. The combination of falling funding and increased short exposure laid the groundwork for massive open interest buildup on the downside. Retail traders appear to be repeating the same behavior seen in all previous cycles, which is buying near tops and selling near bottoms.” That’s exactly what happened last week, when panic-selling followed long liquidations, then flipped instantly into short builds. It’s the same reflexive loop again; Get long late, get liquidated, get short late, and possibly get squeezed. Demand-side data shows continued strength Despite the noise, demand indicators haven’t turned bearish. A chart measuring apparent demand, the difference between newly issued Bitcoin and coins untouched for over a year, shows that the market has absorbed about 160,000 BTC in the past 30 days. That figure means more buying is happening than new supply hitting the market. Wallets labeled as accumulator addresses, those that only buy and never sell, added close to 50,000 BTC during the same timeframe. These addresses are seen as signals of high conviction buying. There’s no selling history behind them, and they’ve consistently been stacking during the latest price chop. Off-chain activity shows OTC desks sitting on less Bitcoin than they’ve held in years, per CryptoQuant. Four years ago this time, these desks held roughly 550,000 BTC, but are now at about 145,000 BTC, a 74% tumble. That means big players aren’t offloading. Instead, it looks like the inventory is getting bought and not replaced. There’s no current sign of demand collapse. Metrics from accumulators, OTC desks, and dormant supply all suggest that long-term positioning is intact. Volatility has affected short-term activity, but longer-term metrics remain stable.

2025-08-03 20:30:47,49485061,1754253047,XRP to $10? This Altcoin Could Deliver 34x Returns,"XRP is back in the spotlight after an explosive rally in July pushed the token above $3.10 for the first time in years. With renewed optimism surrounding the long-awaited ETF decision and legal clarity slowly emerging, investors are now wondering whether $10 is finally on the horizon. Some analysts believe it is. Major investment newsletters have started calling XRP one of the few legacy altcoins with enough liquidity and momentum to make a serious move in this cycle. While Bitcoin takes a breather, XRP is quietly building strength with growing whale activity and steady volume near $7 billion a day. This comes as MAGACOIN FINANCE begins attracting attention from savvy investors looking to diversify before the next big breakout . XRP’s Path to $10 The token’s latest breakout saw a vertical rise from under $2.00 to over $3.60 before settling near the $3.13 range. This performance has reignited talk of XRP reaching double digits—a feat that would require a 3x from current levels. With ETF speculation heating up and the token now a confirmed participant in the upcoming Midnight airdrop, the momentum could build quickly. Why This New Contender Is Gaining Traction While XRP commands headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building something big in the background. With 34x reward potential flagged by multiple top-tier newsletters, the token is becoming a standout in early-stage investing circles. What’s fueling the buzz is not just hype—it’s performance. The most recent presale round closed in record time, and analysts are pointing to the fastest growth curve since the early days of SHIBA INU. For investors who missed previous cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the comeback opportunity . Will XRP Sustain Its Momentum? Despite the strong rally, XRP still faces resistance around $3.60 and psychological pressure near the $5 mark. However, the technical structure remains bullish, and several macro catalysts—including regulatory announcements and institutional inflows—could tilt sentiment sharply. If the current pace holds, a $10 target by late Q4 2025 isn’t out of the question. Conclusion XRP has reentered the race with strong tailwinds, and investor optimism is rising. But for those chasing bigger upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its 34x return potential and explosive presale data. With early access windows closing fast, smart money is moving quickly to get in before the next leg up.

2025-08-03 20:30:24,49484295,1754253024,The Second Circuit has set SBF's appeal hearing for November 2025,"Sam Bankman-Fried’s ( SBF) appeal hearing has been scheduled to begin in the week of November 3, 2025, exactly two years after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy following the widely chronicled collapse of his FTX exchange in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried’s appeal of his conviction and 25-year sentence is set to be heard by the Second Circuit in the week of November 3, 2025. SBF’s appeal hearing is scheduled for November 2025 The proposed calendaring order was originally filed on July 30, 2025, which put the case on the docket two years after his conviction. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) handed SBF a 25-year sentence on March 28, 2024, after a conviction on November 3, 2023, on seven counts, including wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. Sam Bankman-Fried’s case has been moving through the Second Circuit since the spring of 2024, with multiple filings from both sides arguing over the fairness of SBF’s trial, sufficiency of the evidence, and alleged procedural errors. What’s next for SBF? The exact arguments from SBF’s legal team’s formal notice of appeal to the Second Circuit, seeking to overturn his conviction, remain sealed or partially redacted in public filings. However, previous court proceedings suggest SBF is most likely challenging the court’s handling of key evidence, jury instructions, and restrictions on his testimony. The play here would be to get a new trial or a reversal of the conviction. The U.S. government filed its reply on December 13, 2024, where government prosecutors maintained that SBF received a fair trial, and the verdict was backed by strong proof of criminal misconduct. Like the original trial, the crypto sector and beyond will be tuned in to the progress of Bankman-Fried’s appeal . Notably, there is a perception that regulators ramped up the scrutiny on the crypto industry after the dramatic collapse of FTX . If the conviction is confirmed by the Second Circuit, SBF’s remaining legal options will be limited to seeking an en banc rehearing, which is a rare review by all the judges of the Second Circuit. He could also file a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court reverses or erases any portion of the verdict, the case could be remanded for a new trial or resentencing.

2025-08-03 20:30:22,49484080,1754253022,Crypto Funding Hits $1.6B in a Week as Treasury Bets Grow,"The crypto funding in the market is growing fast again. Between July 28 and August 2, crypto companies raised over $1.6 billion. Big investors are now backing projects that connect crypto to real-world uses like payments and finance. This shows growing trust in crypto’s practical future. There is also a growing interest in regulations and financial transparency. Companies are raising capital to prepare for new laws, especially around stablecoins and treasury management. MARA Leads with $850 Million in Crypto Funding MARA, the largest public Bitcoin mining company, made headlines by securing an $850 million private offering through zero-coupon convertible notes due in 2032. The offering targets qualified institutional buyers. It also includes a potential $150 million upsell, possibly bringing the total close to $1 billion. The crypto miner plans to use most of the money to buy more Bitcoin, pay off some debt, and protect its stock from big price swings. The deal is tied to the company’s stock price, showing that investors believe in the company’s strong market position. Furthermore, Mill City Ventures became the first publicly listed company to launch a crypto treasury strategy backed by the Sui Foundation. Through a private placement, Mill City invested $450 million to buy 76.3 million SUI tokens at $3.64 each. The company saw support from Karatage and the Sui Foundation. Mill City plans to keep adding more tokens through OTC deals and public market purchases. FG Nexus Backs Ethereum with $200M Raise FG Nexus, formerly Fundamental Global, raised $200 million to buy Ethereum (ETH) and invest in staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). The move marks Ethereum’s 10th anniversary and a shift to using ETH as its main treasury asset. This initiative was supported by big names such as Galaxy Digital, Kraken, Hivemind Capital, and Digital Currency Group. This strategy puts FG Nexus among the leading corporations pushing Ethereum adoption. In parallel, the ETH Strategy campaign added another 12,342 ETH worth $46.5 million, primarily through private sales. Most of the ETH will go toward staking and liquidity, with the rest supporting audits, growth, and community incentives. Web3 Projects Attract Millions as Stablecoin Momentum Grows Some Web3 and infrastructure-focused projects also secured funding during this period. RD Technologies raised $40 million to build stablecoin infrastructure just as Hong Kong’s stablecoin licensing framework came into effect. Billions Network raised $30 million from Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and Polygon. Backed by ZA Bank, the company plans to launch regulated digital products like HKDR and a cross-border wallet. Tether-backed Stable raised $28 million to build a blockchain for stablecoin payments, led by Bitfinex and Hack VC. The gasless blockchain supports USDT and follows the new GENIUS Act. Likewise, Zodia Markets, backed by Standard Chartered, raised $18.25 million to grow its platform for stablecoin trading and cross-border payments.

2025-08-03 20:06:09,49482570,1754251569,"Experienced Analyst Reveals Options, Bullish and Bearish Price Predictions for Bitcoin Price in the New Week","In his latest report, cryptocurrency analyst Axel Adler evaluated Bitcoin and the general crypto market within the framework of macroeconomic developments, price momentum, and the options market. According to Adler, external risks such as weak employment data and rising trade tariffs have reduced risk appetite in markets, leading to sharp corrections in Bitcoin. According to Adler's analysis, weak nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data released in the US, the Fed's fifth consecutive interest rate cut, and a wave of new tariffs have driven investors to safe havens. Stocks have sold off during this period, and Bitcoin's price has fallen from $119,000 to $112,000. Bitcoin's 30-day momentum has fallen from 8.6% to 3%. Despite increasing short-term market pressure, Adler notes that major companies, particularly Coinbase, Tether, and institutional strategy funds, have made approximately 30,000 BTC worth of new purchases. Coin outflows from exchanges also continue. Related News: Bitcoin Miners' Profit Margin Reaches Highest Level in Recent Times - What Does This Mean? According to Adler, the $119,000 level remains a key resistance level, while the $112,000 level is currently a critical support area. A break above this level could lead to the price testing $110,000, while $108,000 acts as psychological support. A decline in 30-day momentum to 3% indicates a significant weakening of the uptrend, according to Adler. A rebound above 8–10% could indicate buyers are re-entering the market. The Maximum Loss price, which is the level at which the highest loss will occur in the Bitcoin options market, is at $118,000 for the expiration date of August 8, 2025. The sharp decline in option selling volume at levels above $110,000 suggests that bearish positions are weakening, according to Adler. Adler also outlined bull and bear scenarios for the BTC price: Bullish scenario: If the $118,000 level holds and call volume continues to increase, the price could test the $122,500–$125,000 range. A break above this level could bring targets of $130,000 and above to the forefront. Bearish scenario: If the $118,000 level is broken and the put option volume in the $112,500–$115,000 range exceeds $1 million, the price may pull back to the $110,000–$112,500 range. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-03 20:05:33,49482541,1754251533,Analyst: Should We Ignore This XRP Sell Signal?,"Crypto analyst StephisCrypto has shared a weekly chart of XRP paired with the U.S. dollar on Bitstamp, highlighting what the analyst describes as a potentially significant sell signal. The chart features candlestick data extending into mid-2025 and shows that XRP recently climbed to a high above the $3.50 level before a small retracement. Red arrows are marked at prior points of price peaks, suggesting a repeated pattern where these signals coincided with market pullbacks. The chart also shows that the recent upswing in XRP followed a period of sideways price consolidation, culminating in a large green candlestick that propelled the token past the $3 mark. The pattern appears consistent with previous movements where price rallies were accompanied by elevated stochastic relative strength index readings. Should we ignore this #XRP sell signal? pic.twitter.com/qBXPbBGWfo — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 Stochastic RSI Readings and Interpretation In the lower panel of the chart, the stochastic RSI is plotted with two lines colored blue and orange, displaying current readings of approximately 77.65 and 85.77. Historically, each red arrow was placed when the stochastic RSI reached or exceeded similar levels, which often preceded corrective price activity. The analyst appears to be emphasizing that the current stochastic RSI is again in the higher range. While the stochastic RSI can be an indicator of overbought conditions, it is not definitive evidence of an imminent reversal without considering broader market context and price structure. The attached commentary suggests that the analyst is urging caution among traders who rely on technical signals for short-term positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses to the Observation Several users on platform X provided their perspectives on the analysis. An account named X Finance Bull commented , stating that momentum looks stretched but that structural factors are more important to their strategy. This response indicates a preference for prioritizing longer-term support and resistance zones over momentum oscillators alone. Another user, MJS, contributed a perspective suggesting that different investors interpret these signals based on their objectives. MJS noted that if individuals are involved with XRP due to expectations about its role in the future financial system, they should maintain a longer time horizon and not react impulsively to individual technical readings. The statement closed with a remark implying that not all market participants will endure volatility successfully. Considerations for Traders and Investors The chart and commentary illustrate an ongoing debate between technical trading disciplines and broader investment theses. While the stochastic RSI is elevated, suggesting a possible overextension in short-term momentum, other considerations such as overall market structure, adoption trends, and sentiment toward XRP’s long-term utility may influence decisions. The historical examples marked on the chart show that similar stochastic RSI conditions coincided with price pullbacks. However, whether this pattern will repeat depends on factors including liquidity conditions, macroeconomic trends, and developments specific to XRP’s ecosystem. As with any trading decision, participants are encouraged to consider multiple timeframes and to remain aware of the inherent risks in digital asset markets.

2025-08-03 20:00:56,49484988,1754251256,Ethereum vs. Solana: Which Altcoin Will Be the Bull Market Leader?,"Ethereum and Solana are once again drawing headlines as the altcoin market shows renewed signs of life. With Ethereum approaching the $4,000 mark and Solana hovering near $180, investors are comparing the two for leadership in the next bullish leg. But while these giants battle for dominance, another project—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is quietly drawing early-stage attention for those looking beyond the obvious names. Ethereum Shows Strength Into Q3 Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $3,801, up 1.48% in the past 24 hours and 5.42% over the last week. The token’s momentum is being fueled by surging institutional interest, with over $5.4 billion in ETF inflows recorded this month. On-chain data also shows aggressive whale accumulation, with large holders scooping up more than $4 billion in ETH. The rally has been steady, supported by solid fundamentals and a favorable technical setup. RSI indicators remain balanced, showing room for growth without signaling overbought conditions. As a result, Ethereum is once again being positioned as the altcoin market’s pace-setter. Away from the headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own breakout story. The project’s current presale round has eclipsed all previous cycles in demand , with retail and strategic buyers moving in rapidly. Investors are already eyeing amazing returns if the growth curve mirrors early-stage altcoin cycles like SHIBA or PEPE. As major exchange listings loom, access is tightening fast, making early entry more urgent than ever. Solana Faces Pullback After Strong Rally Solana (SOL), now trading at $179.42, is down nearly 6% on the week, even as its long-term chart remains bullish. The RSI reading is slipping below 37, often a sign of oversold conditions, though no strong rebound has formed yet. SOL had previously pushed above $200 but has since retreated as traders rotated profits elsewhere. Despite its drop, Solana maintains a sizable market cap of $96.5 billion, keeping it firmly in the large-cap category. Still, in the current cycle, Solana is showing less resilience compared to Ethereum’s sustained strength. Conclusion In summary, Ethereum appears to be regaining its leadership role thanks to strong ETF inflows and growing institutional demand.

2025-08-03 20:00:26,49484078,1754251226,Spartans Changes the Game with Big Bonuses and a Huge Game List While Betano Focuses on Sponsorships,"The sports betting world is growing fast, not just from big-name deals or large events. The real shift is happening where users play. While Betano has become the new title sponsor of Portugal’s Supertaça and works to increase its name across football, Spartans is standing out in another way. It offers 300% welcome bonuses, 5,963 games, and crypto payouts that are processed right away. This platform gives value now, not later. Today’s users want quick access, fair terms, and smooth payouts. They are starting to care less about big names and more about real use. Betano struggles to match that. Traditional sportsbooks like Betano focus on growing through ads and football deals, while Spartans is showing what a modern betting site can really do. There are no KYC forms, no delays with banks, and no lack of games that offer fast fun and easy access. Betano Partners with FPF to Sponsor Portuguese Super Cup The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) has announced that Betano will sponsor the Supertaça Candido de Oliveira in 2024. Betano is an online betting brand owned by Kaizen Gaming. The agreement is already active. It makes Betano the title sponsor of the Super Cup game between Sporting CP and SL Benfica, which takes place on July 31 at Estadio Algarve. Joao Medeiros Cardoso, head of marketing at FPF, said this deal will raise the Supertaça’s profile and help bring Portuguese football to a wider global audience. The deal also includes matchday events and ways for fans to engage more. Ricardo Branquinho, Betano’s country manager in Portugal, said the company wants to grow its sports support and get closer to fans. Betano is also known for backing FC Bayern, the 2025 Copa América Femenina, and the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. These deals show Betano’s push to become a top name in global football. Esports Toto: South Korea’s Plan to Regulate Esports Gambling South Korea may soon launch “Esports Toto,” a betting system backed by the government. Proposed by KeSPA, this system would allow legal betting on top games like League of Legends and Dota 2. The idea is to build on the country’s Sports Toto model. If approved, it could bring money into leagues, improve esports structures, and add to the National Sports Promotion Fund. The idea is gaining support, especially from South Korea’s Democratic Party, which supports tech. Supporters believe it could fight illegal gambling, bring more trust to the market, and give pro esports teams new backing. But not everyone agrees. Some worry about young people getting hooked on gambling too early. Studies show students already face risks from illegal betting, which now controls 80% of gambling in the country. Critics say that if rules are too weak, Esports Toto could make gambling too normal. Still, if this plan works, South Korea could become a leader in legal esports betting. It might shape how other countries in Asia treat esports and gambling in the future. How Spartans Puts Players First with Fast Access and Big Bonuses While sites like Betano focus on branding and sports sponsorships, Spartans.com takes a direct path to the user. It uses only crypto payments, removing delays from banks and skipping slow checks. Winnings are sent right away, and players can withdraw smoothly at any time. Spartans stands out with over 5,963 games, including slots, blackjack, crash games, roulette, baccarat, and live shows. It also offers a full sportsbook that covers EPL, NBA, UFC, and more. With over 43 providers, the platform has options for all types of players and game styles. Spartans focuses on clear terms, fast features, and full access. There are no delays in getting started, no confusing bonus terms, and no limits based on your location. It’s made to work well for crypto users who want easy use and fair play, not just another big brand. Players can log in on any device, anytime. The site is built for mobile use, and no app is required. Every part of the experience is made to be quick, smooth, and ready for action across all crypto methods. Final Say Betano is gaining attention with more sports deals, but its actual site use is not moving fast enough for crypto users. Spartans puts the focus on the things that matter: more games, stronger bonuses, and fast money out. This is not just about which brand is louder. It’s about which one gives more value. Spartans does that with rewards that don’t take time or steps. Whether you are spinning slots, betting live, or playing table games with crypto, everything works right away and without guesswork. So while Betano builds its name through ads and deals, Spartans gives players something more real. In the fast world of crypto betting, that’s what matters. That’s why more serious players are moving to Spartans now.

2025-08-03 20:00:18,49484076,1754251218,"2025’s Top Crypto Performers: BlockDAG’s BTC Auction Gains, Pi Hits 60M, ENA Moves 17.6%","Strong performance often shows under pressure, and three crypto names are now in focus. Pi Network is moving fast, reaching 60 million users, and Ethena is climbing after a key price breakout. Both are moving forward, but BlockDAG stands out for its structured progress. Its 10 BTC Auction is now live, rewarding presale participants ahead of the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With $360 million raised and 24.6 billion BDAG sold, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focused on results, not just attention. For those watching the top crypto performers of 2025, this approach offers a clear edge. BlockDAG Activates Final Auction Phase Before August 11 Launch BlockDAG has entered the final part of its presale with strong momentum. To raise engagement, it has launched a 10 BTC Auction worth more than $1.1 million. This final move is set to drive activity right before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This is not just a regular giveaway. It works by linking every BDAG purchase before the deadline to the auction. The more one buys, the higher the possible share of the Bitcoin pool. This event is the final stage in a larger plan. So far, BlockDAG has raised $360 million, sold 24.6 billion BDAG, and recorded a 2,660% ROI since Batch 1. Batch 29 is now priced at $0.0276, but a short-term $0.0016 price window remains open, giving new users more potential for gain. BlockDAG’s method is simple and focused: reward those who act, grow user support, and finish strong. With the auction ending soon and winners to be revealed on launch day, the timeline is clear and urgent. Those following the top crypto performers of 2025 will see that BlockDAG is focused on real outcomes. This campaign is designed to turn users into part of the project’s future. With the auction active, the final week offers a clear reward path for those ready to join. Pi Network Progress: User Growth Drives New Phase The current Pi Network outlook shows rising momentum as the platform moves past 60 million registered users. This signals strong traction across its ecosystem. Its Open Network is now live, and over 12 million users have completed the migration from mining to active use on the mainnet. This marks a major shift. Users are now moving from collecting to real participation. This rise in verified users is leading to improved ecosystem use. Pi Network outlook now highlights expanding real-world utility through early apps, growing merchant interest, and wallet features. The launch of Pi App Studio also adds to the pace, inviting developers to build inside a decentralized space backed by a wide user base. Even though price clarity is still unfolding, more listings and better liquidity are expected to help define value. What remains clear is the consistent growth in participation and the steady release of supply. Pi Network is turning community support into real forward movement. Ethena ENA Moves Up: Technical Breakout Builds Strength Ethena ENA technical outlook has shifted after a sharp breakout. In the past week, ENA rose about 17.6 percent after breaking above the $0.485 level, which has now turned into solid support. This move brought new buying interest and higher trading activity. New on-chain data shows more than 1.07 billion ENA taken off exchanges. This suggests lower short-term selling pressure and stronger holding behavior. ENA is now above both its 50-day and 200-day EMAs, pointing to steady upward movement. Forecasts now place the next price zone between $0.60 and $0.70. If momentum keeps building, a run toward $1.00 or more is possible. Still, some short-term risks remain, as RSI and MACD indicators show strong momentum that may lead to a pullback before further gains. BlockDAG Marks a Clear Path in the 2025 Crypto Landscape As Pi Network expands user activity and Ethena moves forward with new technical strength, BlockDAG is following a clear and structured plan. Its 10 BTC Auction links buying activity to reward, forming a presale model focused on timing, planning, and results. BlockDAG has raised over $360 million and is preparing for its GLOBAL LAUNCH on August 11. This effort shows more than potential. It shows real movement. For those reviewing the top crypto performers of 2025, BlockDAG’s progress shows how connecting structure with delivery can set a project apart. The current campaign shows what can happen when every action is designed to create outcome. Among the top crypto performers , BlockDAG is showing how strategy, structure, and timing come together to move forward with purpose.

2025-08-03 20:00:00,49483362,1754251200,"Higher Bitcoin ETF Options Limits May Cut Volatility, but Boost Spot Demand: NYDIG","Bitcoin’s trademark volatility may be entering a new phase thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency's decision to raise position limits on options for most bitcoin ETFs could help smooth price swings by encouraging strategies like covered call selling, which caps the upside in exchange for steady income, according to NYDIG Research. That increase in position limits for options trading on IBIT came as the regulator approved in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs. By letting traders hold ten times more contracts than before, NYDIG wrote, the SEC has opened the door to more aggressive and sustained options activity. Covered call strategies, in particular, work best at scale. They’re designed to earn yield from existing holdings by selling upside exposure, which can naturally suppress price movement if done across large portfolios. Bitcoin’s volatility has already been on the decline, with Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index ( DVOL ) showing a steady decline from around 90 to 38 over the past four years. Still, it stands out compared to bonds, stocks, and other traditional assets. That makes it a tempting target for investors trying to collect income from market swings, effectively harvesting volatility, but also risky for institutions that require stable exposures. “As volatility declines, the asset becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. This dynamic could reinforce spot demand,” NYDIG’s analysts wrote. Ray Dalio, one of the earliest champions of such risk-parity strategies, recently suggested a 15% allocation to gold and crypto amid rising debt levels. “The feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand,” the firm concluded.

2025-08-03 20:00:00,289092,1754251200,Sonic price prediction 2025-2031: Will S reach $1 soon?,"Key takeaways : The average Sonic price prediction for 2025 is $0.5664 Holders can anticipate a maximum price of $1.77 in 2028. By 2031, Sonic (S) might touch $5.58. Fantom Integrates to Sonic (S) Chain On March 25, 2024, Fantom CEO Michael Kong announced the launch of the Sonic mainnet following the completion of its testnet. The proposal included a decentralized bridge to Ethereum for improved security, streamlined staking options, and the introduction of liquid staking. Michael Kong Unveils Sonic’s Launch and Beyond TL;DR Sonic will be used to create a new best-in-class shared (decentralized) sequencer for L1 and L2 chains, capable of 180M daily transactions at sub-second finality, and serve as the foundation to relaunch Fantom as an entirely… pic.twitter.com/AFEYxddC09 — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) March 25, 2024 Fantom fully rebranded as Sonic on January 16, 2025, to reposition itself within the market. As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.2997 Market Cap $863.39M Trading Volume (24-hour) $98.34M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.3042 24-h Low $0.2808 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 9% 50-Day SMA $ 0.340139 14-Day RSI 34.94 Green Days 15/30 (50%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) 200-Day SMA – Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : SONIC is showing a mild recovery but still stuck below major resistance near $0.34 Indicators across both timeframes suggest weak momentum and indecision Key support lies at $0.27 while resistance remains at $0.31 and $0.34 Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day SONIC/USD chart on Aug 3, the asset is attempting a mild rebound, rising approximately 3.20% to $0.3000 after touching lower Bollinger Band support near $0.2753. However, the broader trend remains bearish, with the price significantly below the 20-day SMA at $0.3439 and the upper band resistance at $0.4124. The RSI remains weak at 39.38, indicating that SONIC is still in oversold territory and lacks strong momentum. The MACD remains negative, showing no crossover, which implies that downward pressure could persist. Unless it breaks decisively above the $0.343 resistance, SONIC risks revisiting its lower support zone around $0.27 or lower. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour SONIC/USD chart, the price has rebounded slightly to $0.30, but it remains beneath the midline of the Bollinger Bands ($0.3088), suggesting limited bullish strength. The MACD is flat with both the signal line and MACD line converging near zero, which reflects market indecision and absence of strong trend momentum. The Balance of Power indicates neutral pressure, meaning buyers and sellers are evenly matched. Until the price breaks above $0.31 convincingly, upside remains capped. The lower Bollinger Band at $0.2778 acts as key support, while resistance lies near $0.3398. Consolidation or minor pullback remains likely short-term. Sonic technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.366244 SELL SMA 5 $0.368736 SELL SMA 10 $0.35256 SELL SMA 21 $0.36674 SELL SMA 50 $0.341324 SELL SMA 100 $0.41696 SELL SMA 200 No Data No Data Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.343261 SELL EMA 5 $0.353779 SELL EMA 10 $0.3858 SELL EMA 21 $0.431521 SELL EMA 50 $0.490106 SELL EMA 100 $0.535243 SELL EMA 200 No Data No Data What can you expect from the Sonic (prev.FTM) price analysis next? Based on SONIC’s 1-day and 4-hour charts, the token is showing signs of tentative recovery but remains in a broader bearish structure. On the daily chart, SONIC recently bounced from the lower Bollinger Band and now hovers near $0.30, though it still faces overhead pressure near the $0.3439 mid-band. RSI on the 1-day is weak at 39, indicating limited bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart shows some stabilization but no strong breakout signals, with MACD flat and Balance of Power neutral. Until $0.31–$0.34 is broken with volume, SONIC likely continues in a sideways-to-down trend with resistance overhead and support at $0.27. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5664 price by 2025 and $3.63 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.15 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.63. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.58. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.15 and $3.63, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

2025-08-03 19:55:49,49482071,1754250949,Canadian Teen Convicted in $37M Bitcoin Heist and 2020 X Hacking Spree,"A Canadian teen has been sentenced for a $37 million Bitcoin (BTC) heist and the hacking of several X accounts. This follows on-chain sleuth ZachXBT’s calls for stricter penalties against SIM swapping and social engineering fraudsters. Suspect’s Sentence ZachXBT revealed via a July 29 X post that Cameron Redman had been convicted and ordered to pay compensation following his involvement in a $37 million Bitcoin theft and a related X hacking case that the investigator had uncovered. Court documents show that Redman has been sentenced to 12 months and 1 day, followed by a three-year supervised release term for each count, with all sentences to be served concurrently. He has also been ordered to pay a $400 special assessment, $248,257.07 in restitution, and a $60,000 fine. On February 22, 2020, the Canadian teenager used a SIM swap attack to take control of crypto investor Josh Jones’s mobile number, allowing him to bypass two-factor authentication and access his wallets. He then stole 1,547 BTC and 60,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), valued at around $37 million at the time. Following the theft, Redman began laundering the stolen assets through hundreds of small transactions. These tokens were eventually funneled through centralized exchanges in an attempt to hide the trail. The perpetrator was later linked to phishing scams and the hacking of several NFT profiles on X. According to ZachXBT, in June 2022, Redman offered access to an internal X panel for sale on the platform SWAPD. This was then sold for 250 ETH and led to the compromise of over 10 accounts and the theft of millions through phishing scams. The detective added that the Canadian youth initially used fake identity documents on SWAPD before submitting his real information, withdrew the sale proceeds through Tornado Cash, and then deposited the funds into a Stake account. On-chain data linked the wallet he used to the compromised X accounts. The investigation identified victims, including Beeple, DeeKay, Zeneca, Nouns DAO, and JRNY Club. Calls for Tougher Rules The suspect was formally charged on November 17, 2021, by Hamilton Police in Ontario. Authorities recovered $5.4 million in crypto, but the remaining $31.5 million is still missing. At the time of his arrest, Redman was still legally underage, which meant his name remained sealed and his photo was not released. ZachXBT has previously highlighted how this kind of secrecy is part of the problem, saying the convicted criminal’s identity should have been revealed earlier on to prevent further unlawful conduct. Such cases are on the rise, with research from Keepnet Labs showing a 1,055% increase in SIM swap incidents in the UK in 2024. Elliptic’s State of Crypto Scams 2025 analysis also highlighted phishing as a key method used by cybercriminals like North Korea’s Lazarus, with attackers increasingly automating campaigns using AI tools. Meanwhile, ZachXBT previously reported that between November and December last year, a single hacker breached over 15 X accounts, stealing more than $500,000.

2025-08-03 19:48:57,49481811,1754250537,XRP flashes major ‘sell signal’ as temporary price buffer is identified,"Although XRP has gained some ground in the last 24 hours in a bid to breach the $3 resistance, the asset’s technical structure is painting a concerning picture for the short term. According to analysis by Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential recently flashed a sell signal on the three-day chart, prompting a notable price pullback below the $3 mark, he noted in an X post on August 3. The warning signal came after XRP reached highs above $3.60, with the bearish cue suggesting that the latest rally could be running out of steam. The 9-count TD Sequential signal, known for predicting trend exhaustion, appeared just as XRP approached a resistance zone between $3.60 and $4. Since then, prices have been sliding steadily, and the token is now approaching a key short-term support level. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, on-chain data shows that past accumulation behavior points to $2.80 as a temporary buffer for XRP, but real support begins below $2.48. To this end, Martinez identified $2.40 as the critical zone to watch. If XRP continues to bleed lower, this level could act as a final line of defense for bulls to regroup. A failure to hold above $2.40 may open the door for deeper losses, possibly revisiting the $2.00 region. XRP URPD price chart.

XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current value, XRP’s 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) of $2.65 shows the price is holding above the short-term trend, hinting at bullish sentiment.

2025-08-03 19:30:56,49481165,1754249456,Shiba Inu Faces New Competition—Altcoin Investors Shift to This Trending Token,"Altcoin investors are known for their agility—moving capital toward the next breakout before it hits the mainstream. That’s why all eyes are now on the meme coin sector, where legacy players like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are starting to show signs of exhaustion. SHIB, despite its iconic run, has stalled in recent weeks, leaving some holders to explore fresher, lower-cap alternatives. These moves often happen before the crowd notices, and this time, one particular token is drawing that attention. Analysts now predict a potential 27x return from MAGACOIN FINANCE if current adoption patterns hold. Why SHIB Momentum May Be Peaking After peaking in early 2021, SHIB’s community remained one of the strongest in crypto. But in 2025, price action has been relatively flat. As market-wide liquidity picks up, especially in the meme sector, investors are beginning to rotate funds from older assets into tokens that have yet to experience exponential gains . Blockchain data already shows capital migration toward emerging tokens with meme power, tight supply curves, and high virality. For SHIB holders seeking the next wave, the challenge lies in identifying early-stage projects before listings drive prices up . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Giant Before the Roar One such project now gaining momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With politically charged branding, a fast-expanding online community, and explosive early-stage engagement, it’s emerging as a major contender. According to recent projections, a 27x price explosion might be on the table if current trajectory and adoption patterns continue. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE unique is its combination of viral market appeal and early access scarcity. Market researchers now compare its adoption velocity to the early days of SHIB itself – a coin that also saw explosive early growth due to community intensity and narrative pull. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently in a limited-access stage, and as new investors pile in, the window for strategic entry narrows with each passing day. Analysts and early traders are calling this moment one of the final chances to participate before it hits broader exchanges. Conclusion As the meme coin cycle enters a new phase, projects with strong branding and active communities are dominating social charts. While SHIB’s role in the meme ecosystem remains foundational, capital tends to flow toward asymmetrical opportunities. That dynamic shift is now favoring tokens still in their early momentum phase. Meme coin cycles reward timing. SHIB had its moment, but new tokens are attracting both retail attention and analyst optimism. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 27x upside now circulating among researchers and trading desks, many believe it may be the next to explode. Whether it surpasses SHIB remains to be seen—but the clock for early access is ticking .

2025-08-03 19:30:10,49481069,1754249410,"Bitcoin Treasury Companies Are ‘Logical’ As Government Severely Devalues $37,000,000,000,000 US Debt: Macro Guru Luke Gromen","Macro guru Luke Gromen says the rise of Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury companies is a logical response to the US government’s continued debasement of the dollar. In a new video update on YouTube, Gromen says investors are currently reacting to a large-scale financial bubble that has been “kicked upstairs” through the stock, banking, and housing markets before finally being pushed into the Treasury market. Gromen notes that the only way for the US government to maintain the bubble – rather than face a default or a severe depression to get its fiscal situation back in order – is to devalue its debt via inflation. Now that such a reality is becoming clear to market participants, Gromen says it makes perfect sense that many corporate entities are creating shareholder value by taking advantage of BTC’s strict supply cap. “In my opinion, it’s critical to remember how we got here. We had an equity bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the banking sector and the housing sector, it created a housing bubble, it popped, we kicked the problem upstairs to the Treasury market by backstopping virtually everything… Now the credit risk is at the Treasury market level, except, Treasuries have no credit risk. The government can always just print the money to make interest payments and avoid default. So there’s no credit risk in Treasuries, only inflation risk. So in my opinion, what we’re seeing in Bitcoin treasury companies in particular is logical, in light of this primrose path we’ve followed over the past 25 years. As more and more people begin to realize the only way out of this is severe devaluation of US debt, of US sovereign debt, of Western sovereign debt. In that case, I would expect credit spreads to remain relatively low, because all else equal, I’d rather own an Apple bond or a Microsoft bond than a US Treasury bond.” At time of writing, the US government’s national debt is about $37 trillion.

2025-08-03 19:21:40,49480777,1754248900,Bitfinex Whale Buys 300 $BTC Per Day During Crypto Market Crash,"The crypto market is on the back foot after Bitcoin retreats below the $113K threshold, losing over 21% in trading volume over the past 24 hours. The community sentiment is also pushing into the bear zone as the Fear and Greed Index retreats to neutral. Despite the looming trend, one Bitfinex whale decided this is the right time to invest and started gobbling up Bitcoins at a rate of 300 per day. Blockstream CEO, Adam Back, is the one who pointed it out , while also reminding the community that the same whale was acquiring $BTC at a rate of 1,000 per day back in February. This type of investment in a crypto market has ‘buy the dip’ written all over it, in preparation of an even bigger bull. The Market Goes Down as Eric Trump Pushes ‘Buy the Dip’ Message Eric Trump joins the ‘buy the dip’ crowd by sending the message loud and clear on X . Eric posted the message just as Bitcoin was sinking to $112,724, displaying his undying confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to bounce back. This was expected, given that Eric Trump’s Bitcoin stake is about to get $367M fatter. This would be the direct result of the merger between American Bitcoin Corp. and Gryphon Digital Mining, which would give Eric Trump access to over 367M shares, each valued at $1. The deal is set to undergo stockholder approval on August 27, 2025, and 10 AM ET. The merger, announced on July 29 , would make Eric Trump one of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto sphere, which would rush in a new era for Bitcoin and, by extension, the entire crypto market. But why is the crypto market backpedalling? The most obvious reason is Trump’s tariff suspension ending on Friday , which puts pressure on the global economic system once more. On the bright side, the trade agreement saw tariffs go down for US’s trading partners, especially for countries like the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the EU. Despite that, the feeling of economic uncertainty and turmoil lingers, which, ultimately, benefits the crypto market. This means that we should expect a crypto resurgence once Bitcoin bounces back, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will become top gainers thanks to their blockchain utility. Why Snorter Token ($SNORT) is Perfect for Opportunistic Investors Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the perfect ecosystem for opportunistic investors thanks to Snorter Bot, the trader’s best sniper friend. Snorter Bot is the ideal solution to manual coin hunting, which is typically ineffective and exposes you to scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot circumvents these problems by: Instituting real-time alerts to protect against suspicious projects Sniping hot tokens in milliseconds after liquidity appears; so, no lost opportunity Operating in its Telegram chat-only, eliminating the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions The Copy Trading perk is also great for replicating proven strategies to increase your chance of success. All these advantages recommend Snorter Token ($SNORT) as the best choice for opportunistic traders who lack the time or know-how to engage with the market actively. With Snorter Token, you just tailor the Aardvark Bot according to your needs, give it the sniper rifle, and set it loose. $SNORT is still in presale now with a cash pool of $2.7M and growing and a token price of $0.1001. So, if you want to join the project, you should do it while $SNORT is still at its presale price. Given the project’s utility and following post-launch mainstream adoption, $SNORT could experience a massive chart boost in 2025. You can buy your $SNORT by going to the presale page today. When Will the Crypto Market Recover? With Bitcoin already back above the $114K threshold and a 24-hour growth rate of 0.55%, it’s safe to say that the market is already pushing back. While it’s too early to say whether this is a small bump or the sign of a sustained climb, one thing is certain: Bitcoin will bounce back. And when it does, we should expect a new ATH, following July’s $123,153.22, which will drag the entire market along for the ride. That’s when utility-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) could also see an investor surge. This isn’t financial advice.

Arkham pointed out that the address that moved the $ETH already bought another $800M previously for SharpLink Gaming, with the latest transaction of $108.6M going to Galaxy Digital OTC. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve places SharpLink Gaming second on the list of companies with the largest $ETH reserves, with 438.2K tokens.

According to the same data, 2.26% of the total $ETH supply is spread out between 63 strategic reserves, amounting to 2.73M coins with a value of $9.39B. Institutional Interest for $ETH is Going Up as Bitmine’s Tom Lee Predicts a $60,000 $ETH The data shows that public institutions show an increased interest in Ethereum, with some entities exhibiting aggressive buying strategies. The Ether Machine is one such case, after adding 15,000 $ETH to their treasury recently at an average price of $3,809.97 for a total investment of $56.9M. Moreover, the company also announced that they plan an additional $407M investment , which, if it goes through, would more than double Bitmine’s current $ETH reserves of 625K. As the company put it in their X post, this investment strategy isn’t about profit hunting: ‘We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term – not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.’ Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, also pointed out that Ethereum ETFs are experiencing a price surge , with massive inflows hitting the market. Ethereum’s ETF inflows are currently outperforming Bitcoin, up 13% to Bitcoin’s 8% loss over the past two months. This pro-ETH context, with Wall Street becoming increasingly more interested in the asset, drove Tom Lee, chairman of Bitmine, to put $ETH’s Estimated Value Potential (EVP) at $60,000+ . He also thinks that the ETH/BTC ratio is off right now and that it’s likely to match 2024’s numbers soon, which would force $ETH up to $5,707 in the near future. With $ETH booming in charts and a bull run waiting to happen, ERC-20 projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) are likely to catch steam first. How $BEST Fuels One of the Best Non-Custodial Wallet Ecosystems $BEST is the official token of the Best Wallet ecosystem, a non-custodial, KYC-free service that’s perfect for novice and experienced traders alike. Best Wallet’s non-custodial profile translates to higher security, as you control the private key and, thus, the funds. The wallet also offers access to a variety of features, including the Token Launchpad, which grants exclusive access to upcoming tokens, allowing you to invest early. The Market Insights feature is another useful addition, feeding you real-time updates on hot projects, market sentiment, and chart trends. This allows you to make more informed decisions before investing. $BEST is currently in presale with over $14.4M already in the bank. This makes $BEST one of the most successful presales of 2025 and one that sets Best Wallet on the road to success. Based on Best Wallet’s features, public appeal, top security, and the fact that it’s free to use, we expect $BEST to experience a chart boom post launch. $BEST’s growth will further feed the Best Wallet ecosystem, pushing it closer to its underlying goal: to capture over 40% of the crypto wallet market share by 2026 . You can buy $BEST at its presale price of $0.025425 by visiting the official presale page. Will We See Another $ETH ATH in 2025? Given the rising investor interest in $ETH, we may see another Ethereum rally soon, pushing the asset to the psychological threshold of $4,000. We may not get Tom Lee’s $60K Ethereum in 2025, but a goal of $5,700 isn’t impossible, once $ETH clears the $4,000 resistance point. When that happens, projects like Best Wallet ($BEST) will be among the first to see the benefits. This isn’t financial advice.

According to the company's data, the price of BTC fell by 4% in a short period of time, from $118,920 to below $114,000. This move occurred immediately after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs. During the drop, over $195 million worth of long positions in futures were liquidated. At the same time, a total of 21,400 BTC belonging to short-term investors were transferred to exchanges at a loss. CryptoQuant noted that this behavior has been observed in similar price drops before. For example: July 15, 2025: 50,134 BTC moved to exchanges July 25, 2025: 39,105 BTC sent to exchanges Related News: A New Claim About Satoshi Nakamoto's Identity Has Been Made: Could It Be That He Has Been Right in Front of Us All Along? This move has brought Bitcoin to the edge of a critical on-chain support cluster, according to the firm's analysis. CryptoQuant noted that this level is defined as a “gap” below which there is weak liquidity and weak support. According to the analysis firm, the critical areas to watch for the BTC price are as follows: Onchain support: $111,600 Technical support (previous ATH): $112,000 Traders' Realized Price: $105,500 *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-03 19:05:00,49480184,1754247900,Bitcoin Crashes Below $115K as Trump Sparks Nuclear Tensions and Fed Turmoil,"Bitcoin plummeted to $113,164 on Friday, losing nearly 8% within hours and triggering over $200 million in liquidations. The downturn coincides with former President Donald Trump’s aggressive political maneuvering and amid rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia. The market’s dramatic downturn reflects growing investor anxiety as Trump reenters the political landscape with incendiary foreign policy statements and attacks on U.S. economic institutions. Trump Orders Sub Repositioning Amid Russia Standoff Trump’s latest posts on Truth Social revealed a major military action: he ordered two nuclear submarines to reposition amid threats from Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. Medvedev had dismissed Trump’s demand to stop the war in Ukraine within ten days as a “step towards war.” Trump responded, stating that there were now “unintended consequences” with military assets being moved. Markets quickly reacted to the escalation, with Bitcoin leading the retreat. Risk assets faltered as the prospect of renewed nuclear tension rattled global investors. Trump Blasts Fed and Jobs Figures Ahead of Election In a separate series of posts, Trump accused Labor Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of fudging job numbers to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’s chances in the 2024 election. He demanded that she be fired and referred to the numbers as “fake.”. Trump also criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him “a stubborn MORON” and demanding now rate cuts. He urged the Federal Reserve Board to work around Powell’s control, an unprecedented suggestion that breaks with decades of central bank independence. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler Resigns, Opening Trump Path Amidst growing political pressure, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler resigned Friday. Though she gave no definite reason, Kugler’s early departure leaves a key vacancy at the central bank—one Trump would be in a position to fill. Kugler, a Biden appointee and vocal supporter of rate stability, had sat out this week’s policy vote. Her resignation adds to the uncertainty at a time when institutional credibility is under assault from the top offices. Bitcoin in the Crosshairs of Political and Market Uncertainty Bitcoin’s steep drop reflects the market’s flight from risk amid global uncertainty. It now trades 7% beneath its all-time high of $123,182, which was reached a few weeks ago. Analysts point to tightening futures premiums and decreased leveraged activity as signs of momentum that is fading. Against expectations that Bitcoin would serve as a haven during political conflict, the asset has instead followed tech stocks, contradicting the safe-haven narrative. Investors are now shifting to short-term bonds and cash positions. Gold has also held firm at around $3,350, but even it has not been able to offer much comfort. Dalio Reassesses Bitcoin Amid U.S. Debt Fears Amidst the turmoil, some long-term investors are giving Bitcoin’s prospects a second thought. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, now recommends allocating as much as 15% of portfolios to Bitcoin or gold as a hedge against inflation and debt. “The U.S. is beginning a debt doom loop,” Dalio warned, referring to a $12 trillion Treasury forecast. While cautious about Bitcoin’s volatility, he acknowledged its evolving character as a store-of-value asset. Conclusion Bitcoin’s fall below $115,000 is more than a matter of price volatility—it is an indicator of a broader investor flight driven by political uncertainty and economic doubt. As Trump reshapes the narrative on nuclear policy and economic rectitude, Bitcoin’s future trajectory will be determined not just by charts but by politics.",Blockchain|Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,bitcoin plummeted friday losing nearly within hour triggering million liquidation downturn coincides former president donald trump aggressive political maneuvering amid rising geopolitical tension russia market dramatic downturn reflects growing investor anxiety trump reenters political landscape incendiary foreign policy statement attack economic institution trump order sub repositioning amid russia standoff trump latest post truth social revealed major military action ordered two nuclear submarine reposition amid threat dmitry medvedev deputy chairman russia security council medvedev dismissed trump demand stop war ukraine within ten day step towards trump responded stating unintended consequence military asset moved market quickly reacted escalation bitcoin leading retreat risk asset faltered prospect renewed nuclear tension rattled global investor trump blast fed job figure ahead election separate series post trump accused labor commissioner erika mcentarfer fudging job number boost vice president kamala harris chance election demanded fired referred number trump also criticized fed chairman jerome powell calling stubborn moron demanding rate cut urged federal reserve board work around powell control unprecedented suggestion break decade central bank independence fed governor adriana kugler resigns opening trump path amidst growing political pressure federal reserve governor adriana kugler resigned friday though gave definite reason kugler early departure leaf key vacancy central trump would position fill kugler biden appointee vocal supporter rate stability sat week policy vote resignation add uncertainty time institutional credibility assault top office bitcoin crosshairs political market uncertainty bitcoin steep drop reflects market flight risk amid global uncertainty trade beneath high reached week ago analyst point tightening future premium decreased leveraged activity sign momentum fading expectation bitcoin would serve political conflict asset instead followed tech stock contradicting narrative investor shifting bond cash position gold also held firm around even able offer much comfort dalio reassesses bitcoin amid debt fear amidst turmoil investor giving bitcoin prospect second thought ray dalio founder bridgewater associate recommends allocating much portfolio bitcoin gold hedge inflation debt beginning debt doom loop dalio warned referring trillion treasury forecast cautious bitcoin volatility acknowledged evolving character asset conclusion bitcoin fall matter price indicator broader investor flight driven political uncertainty economic doubt trump reshapes narrative nuclear policy economic rectitude bitcoin future trajectory determined chart politics,0.234,0.645,0.121,-0.9936,0
2025-08-03 19:04:30,49480084,1754247870,Did China Ban Cryptocurrency? What The Story Is Really About,"False reports are circulating claiming that China has issued a new ban on cryptocurrency. Some accounts are spreading rumors that China has banned cryptocurrencies again, without any evidence. These claims lack any official statement or legal text. They rely solely on hearsay. According to Bitcoin Junkies, China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China imposed its last major restrictions in September 2021, targeting mining and exchange activities. That policy remains unchanged. No fresh edicts or directives have emerged from Beijing in 2025. WARNING: False reports are circulating claiming that China has issued a new ban on cryptocurrency. China has not made any recent announcements regarding crypto regulations. China banned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies back in 2021, and that policy remains unchanged. pic.twitter.com/6jiasBWEea — Bitcoin Junkies (@BTCjunkies) August 3, 2025 Bitcoin trades at $114,071 USD, with a live market cap of $2.27 trillion. It sees $53.98 billion in 24-hour volume and holds the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. This positions Bitcoin as the leading digital asset, far ahead of competitors in liquidity and adoption. The four key facts you need to know: Hong Kong as a pilot zone embraces crypto. Hong Kong has launched initiatives to attract exchanges and token issuers. Its regulators have rolled out a licensing regime for spot trading platforms. China never banned individual crypto transactions. Private peer-to-peer transfers remain legal. Only institutional participants, banks, payment firms, and funds are prohibited from offering crypto services. Bitcoin mining still occurs in China. Many miners displaced in 2021 shifted abroad, but some resumed operations in regions with looser enforcement. Estimates suggest China still accounts for around 15% of global hash rate. Stablecoins and RWAs gain traction among officials. Chinese authorities explore tokenized real-world assets and regulated stablecoins for on-chain use cases. Pilot programs in Guangdong and Shanghai test asset-backed instruments. What Beijing’s 2021 Ban Covered Exchange closures. All domestic crypto trading platforms were ordered to cease operations. Mining shut-down. Major mining provinces rescinded power allocations for crypto-heavy users. Financial institutions barred. Banks and payment providers were forbidden from clearing crypto transactions. That framework persists today. No new clauses have been introduced. No new fines have been announced. Hong Kong SAR operates under a separate legal system. It launched its new crypto licensing regime in June 2024. The Securities and Futures Commission now issues licenses to spot exchanges and custodians. This makes Hong Kong one of Asia’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Its pilot zone model aims to draw talent, capital, and blockchain projects away from Silicon Valley and Dubai. On-chain Reality Shows China’s Strong Belief Despite official bans, Chinese nationals still hold and transact crypto. Peer-to-peer OTC desks thrive on messaging apps. VPN-enabled access to foreign exchanges remains common. On-chain data shows persistent activity. Bitcoin’s on-chain transfer volume averages over $20 billion daily, with a sizeable share originating from IPs linked to China. Further Considerations China continues to explore digital currency with its central bank digital currency (e-CNY). That project does not equate to an outright ban on all private crypto. Instead, it reflects a desire to maintain monetary sovereignty and clamp down on illicit finance. As regulators study tokenized stocks, bonds, and commodities, China may issue further guidelines on real-world assets (RWAs) and stablecoins. These moves will shape the next phase of blockchain adoption on the mainland. In sum, the rumor of a fresh China crypto ban is just that, a rumor. China’s 2021 restrictions remain in force. No new prohibitions have been introduced. Meanwhile, Hong Kong forges ahead with open-market policies, and private transactions continue on Chinese-controlled networks. The crypto community can rest easy: nothing new has changed in Beijing’s rulebook. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The bond, denominated in U.S. dollars with a size capped at $300 million and a three-year maturity, is the first digitally native bond from a Chinese brokerage to be offered to the public. The offering was carried out through HSBC Orion, a distributed ledger-based digital assets platform, with GTJAI serving as both lead joint coordinator and issuer. @MichaelLINY, a crypto educator on X, revealed that the digital bond was minted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The digital bond uses blockchain infrastructure to enhance transparency, streamline issuance, and reduce settlement inefficiencies common in traditional finance. The company says this move aligns with its broader push for innovation in financial services, particularly through technologies that support programmable and secure instruments. GTJAI stated that it will use this issuance as an opportunity to explore cross-border digital asset issuance and other innovative finance applications. First ever Chinese Digital Bond minted on the #XRP Ledger GTJAI Successfully Issued the First Publicly Offered Digital Bond of a Chinese Securities Firm ..This transaction demonstrates the capabilities of HSBC Orion to enable both a broader range of digital bonds and issuers.… pic.twitter.com/EbuKp7jUcz — The light shines in the darkness (@MatthewLINY) August 2, 2025 Signs of XRP’s Growing Infrastructure Role HSBC Orion has developed capabilities that can integrate with various DLT environments, including those supported by Ripple’s institutional-grade custody partner, Metaco. Notably, HSBC and Ripple-owned Metaco entered into a partnership in late 2023 to launch tokenized securities custody solutions, a move that firmly aligns the bank with Ripple’s blockchain ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The XRPL is recognized for its efficiency in settling tokenized assets and other fixed-income products, such as bonds and treasury bills . Although it was not directly referenced in the GTJAI deal, its technological compatibility and Ripple’s growing institutional presence are increasingly relevant as firms like HSBC expand custody and issuance infrastructure for digital bonds. The involvement of Ripple-linked entities in key layers of infrastructure hints at the possibility of XRP or XRPL-related rails used in future capital market deployments, especially as the tokenization market grows . Institutional Leaders Embrace Blockchain Technology Zhang Xueming, GTJAI’s Chief Financial Officer, described the issuance as both a proof of technological leadership and a demonstration of the firm’s commitment to next-generation financial services. HSBC’s John O’Neill, who leads the bank’s digital assets division, commented that the partnership allows HSBC Orion to support “a broader range of digital bonds and issuers.” With the bank already embedding custody infrastructure through Ripple’s Metaco, HSBC’s role in bridging traditional finance and tokenized instruments continues to deepen.

2025-08-03 19:00:55,49480085,1754247655,Best Way to Make Money With Crypto,"In the world of crypto, one principle remains undefeated: timing. Not just buying low and selling high, but entering before the wave begins. From Bitcoin’s earliest days at under $1 to Ethereum’s quiet beginnings at $0.30, the biggest winners were not those with the most capital—but those with the most foresight. Fast forward to 2025, and the opportunity hasn’t disappeared. If anything, it’s evolved. Now, smart investors are hunting for tokens that offer asymmetric upside—projects with strong narratives, emerging communities, and clear signals of momentum before mainstream exposure kicks in. This approach is what turns $500 into $50,000, and helps level the playing field between retail traders and institutions. Today’s profit strategies go beyond holding Bitcoin or earning yield through DeFi. While those approaches offer stability, the fastest gains still come from early entry into under-the-radar altcoins —especially those with viral branding, limited access windows, and traction that mirrors early crypto giants. But identifying the right project requires more than hype. With tools like on-chain analysis, Telegram activity trackers, and social volume aggregators, today’s investor has sharper insight than ever before into what’s building beneath the surface. Why Early-Stage Tokens Still Offer the Best ROI Most projects don’t go 100x. But those that do usually share a few common traits—and they all rewarded those who recognized the patterns early. In recent months, one particular token has been making waves for just that reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention across platforms like X and Telegram not simply for its meme appeal, but for the velocity of its adoption. Crypto research groups tracking social metrics say its early trajectory mirrors the rise of Ethereum Classic, two tokens that generated major returns for initial adopters. But unlike older assets that are now deep into their market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth curve . The project’s viral branding, combined with a limited-access phase, has created a rush among early participants. Every round has seen rapid sellouts, and the project’s social growth has already rivaled meme giants like Dogecoin in their infancy. Analysts now forecast that its current pricing window may be one of the last remaining chances for sharp asymmetric entry before broader exchange access resets the opportunity. How to Spot High-Upside Tokens Before the Crowd Spotting altcoins before they explode isn’t about luck—it’s about pattern recognition. Historically, the biggest crypto winners showed early signs long before their names hit mainstream headlines. These included subtle metrics like surging social media growth, increasing wallet holders, and high engagement rates on social channels like X and Telegram . They also tended to feature emotionally resonant branding, whether political, cultural, or comedic—something that hooks communities and sustains hype across weeks or months. Another key factor? Scarcity of access. The earliest-stage tokens that go on to make 10x–100x moves are often available only for a limited time through exclusive, time-sensitive windows. Once listed on major exchanges, these assets usually price in their potential, leaving little room for exponential gains . The most strategic investors understand this—they track momentum, measure community velocity, and look for entry points when the crowd is still on the sidelines. Final Thoughts: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Act Early The best way to make money in crypto has always been clear— get in before everyone else realizes what’s happening . Whether it’s through identifying social trends, spotting wallet inflows, or analyzing price structure before breakout, timing and conviction are the real tools of the trade. In today’s cycle, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum precisely because they offer that rare mix: powerful community traction, viral positioning, and limited access. And as history has shown, when these elements align, the results can be game-changing .

2025-08-03 19:00:23,49480469,1754247623,Ireland’s central bank chief says October annual budget might harm the economy,"The Irish central bank’s governor, Gabriel Makhlouf, has raised concerns about the government’s focus on enhancing the economy in its October annual budget. Makhlouf warns that the country could be in a bad situation if the government pushes its agenda to boost spending excessively. This statement comes two weeks after the government’s October annual budget proposals were released. The plans comprised a 6.4% increase in spending that everyone needed to adhere to. Meanwhile, this increase in spending, according to analysis from sources, is lower compared to the past budgets set, which ranged between 8% to 9%. Makhlouf raises concerns over the government’s recently released budget plan During an interview, Makhlouf explained that additional stimulus in the sector is unnecessary when an economy is fully employed . Therefore, based on his argument, the government should reconsider its budget plan. The Irish central bank’s governor also pointed out that the country’s economy was in a bad state, urging that the government’s plan could further worsen the situation. On the other hand, in an earlier announcement, the government had mentioned making changes in tax cuts and spending. Following these changes, the agency vowed to reduce the suggested 9.4 billion euro tax cuts and higher expenditure in 2026, if Trump increases the tariff rates above the 10% currently set. Coincidentally, after the agency made public its budget plans in the Summer Economic Statement, the US struck a trade deal with the EU, which resulted in a 15% import tariff on goods from the EU. Concerning the budget plan in the Summer Economic Statement, Makhlouf expressed that he hoped the government would consider changing this plan and make a final one. He concluded, “By then, the government will have thought again about what the trade situation is showing us.” Ireland’s infrastructure lags behind compared to its economic rivals Last month, Prime Minister Micheal Martin announced plans to raise Ireland’s spending on infrastructure by 30%. This increment in spending came after Apple made a €14 billion, or $16 billion , tax payment to the country. Apart from the tax payment, funds raised from selling bank shares also contributed to this significant change. This followed warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Ireland had fallen behind its economic rivals in terms of infrastructure. The report also reported that the country has not utilized tax revenue from the multinationals for years to improve its ailing energy sector, water systems, and housing supply. To address these challenges, the agency has revealed that it intends to shift its focus towards enhancing the energy sector with significant capital investment plans and diversifying energy sources, improving its infrastructure, starting with public transport like roads, and boosting water services in the country to improve housing availability. However, to successfully improve housing availability, Ireland’s national water utility stated that it would require significant funds to supply water services adequately. With its revenue challenges, the government finds it hard to achieve these goals, especially improving housing availability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-08-03 19:00:06,49479933,1754247606,"Live Games, 300% Bonus, & Instant Withdrawals: Here’s How Spartans Beats DraftKings and Betsson in 2025","Bonus offers, marketing campaigns, and strategic expansions fill the betting space, but not every platform excels where it truly matters: clarity, ease of use, and fairness. Betsson has just made a move into Brazil, building a customized platform aligned with local rules. DraftKings continues to grow in the U.S. with stronger live betting features and new lottery integrations. While these efforts push both forward, crypto-first users still face gaps in speed, transparency, and global access. That’s where Spartans steps ahead. It offers 5,963 games, a 300% welcome bonus with clearly outlined terms, and fast crypto withdrawals. With sportsbook access across top leagues, it brings unmatched convenience and value. DraftKings: Advanced Tech, Traditional Limits DraftKings holds strong brand recognition in digital sports betting. Its public NASDAQ listing and recent analyst projections, like Bernstein’s $46 price target, reflect confidence in its growth, largely due to its in-game betting systems. The acquisition of SimpleBet boosted its pricing tech, making real-time bets more accurate and widespread. It also added Jackpocket to expand into digital lottery, allowing cross-promotion between sports betting and lottery players. Users can choose from slots, blackjack, roulette, sportsbook access, and fantasy sports. Yet, some drawbacks remain. DraftKings is mainly built for fiat users, with slow withdrawals and restricted access based on region. Bonus offers differ by location and are often buried in fine print. For those seeking faster crypto use and global flexibility, DraftKings may fall short of being the best pick. Betsson: Building Trust in Regional Markets Betsson is focusing on regulated growth in emerging areas. Its Brazil launch, through a local partnership, adds to its presence in Colombia and Argentina. The company’s approach prioritizes legal compliance and tailored platforms offering sports betting, casino games, and virtual sports. Betsson also launched a responsible gambling campaign in Brazil, supporting safer play with education and awareness tools. This effort has earned praise from industry watchers as a responsible way to grow in new markets. Still, crypto-friendly users may find the platform lacking. Withdrawal speeds are slower, bonuses lack transparency upfront, and there’s limited public access to fairness metrics like RTP. While Betsson continues to grow in localized spaces, it doesn’t yet fully meet the expectations of speed or crypto accessibility. Spartans: Fast Crypto, Clear Bonuses, and 5,963 Games That Work Smoothly Spartans wasn’t made to follow outdated designs; it was built to fix their weak points. That’s why crypto users are turning to it. With 5,963 casino titles, an all-in-one sportsbook from soccer to MMA, and instant crypto payout systems, Spartans delivers on clarity, speed, and utility. The 300% welcome bonus comes with upfront rules, users know the 35x playthrough, 7-day window, and max cashout before depositing. These terms remain stable across all regions, which is a rare advantage over DraftKings and Betsson. What also makes a difference is how quickly users get their funds. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT, withdrawals are handled instantly. Game fairness is backed by published RTP and provably fair systems. Whether playing roulette, blackjack, or live bets, the performance remains smooth. Spartans also stands out with features others skip: mobile access with no need for an app, a fully disclosed affiliate setup (CPA, Rev Share, Hybrid), and a Lamborghini prize draw for top members. For those evaluating the best betting sites based on features that matter, Spartans delivers results where others still fall behind. Final Thoughts DraftKings is leaning into live betting and lottery tools. Betsson is growing with a regulation-focused model in Latin America. But both still leave major gaps, especially for those who want fast cashouts, upfront bonuses, and global crypto options. Spartans answers those needs directly. With over 5,900 games, worldwide sportsbook access, and bonus terms that are clearly stated, Spartans shows that the best betting site isn’t defined by name recognition, it’s about delivery. With instant crypto withdrawals and fair play built in, Spartans isn’t just a challenger, it’s a better choice.

2025-08-03 19:00:06,49481521,1754247606,"Bloomberg Analyst Says Crypto Is Falling Behind, Despite Bitcoin Strength","Mike McGlone, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, has recently shared a warning about the future of cryptocurrencies. He says that while Bitcoin (BTC) is still doing well, the rest of the crypto market is not keeping up with other big assets like stocks, gold, and government bonds. He said that Bitcoin and the U.S. Treasury bonds could become two of the best-performing investments this year, especially during tough economic times. Crypto Returns Match Stocks But With Higher Risk McGlone pointed to lower investor demand and high interest rates as reasons why many digital coins are under pressure . So far in 2025, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) has gained 7%. This matches the year-to-date return of the S&P 500, the main stock market index in the United States. However, McGlone warns that this comparison is misleading. Although he acknowledged that the crypto market is maturing, high volatility makes it more risky. According to McGlone, crypto gives the same return as the S&P 500 but with four times the volatility. He highlighted that investors are taking on much more risk for the same level of profit. At the same time, the Bloomberg Dollar Index has fallen by 7.5% this year. A weaker dollar usually helps push up asset prices, including crypto. Even with this drop, most cryptocurrencies are still not doing well. This adds to McGlone’s argument that the market is not as strong as it appears. Bitcoin May Still Lead, But the Rest May Struggle While McGlone sees problems in the wider crypto market, he still expects the flagship crypto to do well. In his view, Bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bonds are the most likely to perform well this year. This may seem like a contradiction, but McGlone sees long-term value in Bitcoin, calling it a digital form of gold because of its limited supply and adoption rate. However, he also warns that Bitcoin’s success may depend on how the stock market behaves. Furthermore, McGlone also predicts that the stock market will fall sharply. His warning followed a 1.6% fall in the S&P 500 last Friday. This drop caused weaker-than-expected jobs data, which raised concerns about the strength of the economy. Bitcoin Drops After July High In July 2025, Bitcoin hit a record high of $122,838, but since then, its price has dropped to about $112,113. Other cryptocurrencies have fallen even more. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $113,789, up 0.93% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analyst Mike McGlone once said Bitcoin could fall as low as $10,000. Although this has not happened yet, he still stands by his warning. Even though some people disagree with him , McGlone still believes the crypto market could see a big drop.

2025-08-03 08:53:00,49459695,1754211180,Trader loses $908K to 458-day-old fake transaction,"A crypto user has fallen victim to a sophisticated wallet-draining scam, losing $908,551 in USD Coin (USDC) nearly 16 months after unknowingly authorizing a malicious smart contract. Onchain data reveals the approval transaction was signed on April 30, 2024 — but the theft occurred much later, on August 2, 2025. This incident marks yet another alarming breach in the crypto space. The attack began with an ERC-20 approval transaction, likely embedded in a fake airdrop or a spoofed legitimate-looking website. The victim unknowingly signed the transaction, granting the scammer access to their funds. Scammer strikes 458 days later as dormant wallet springs to life The scammer’s wallet had a disreputable pink-drainer.eth address, “0x67E5Ae”, where the stolen $908,551 worth of USDC stablecoin was received. The attack was carried out on August 2 at 4:57 AM UTC, according to Scam Sniffer’s X post . This was 458 days, just after the victim accidentally approved a transaction that appeared to be legit on April 30, 2024. The unexpected attack has raised security concerns among crypto users. To address this, Scam Sniffer, a firm that keenly monitors malicious activities in the crypto space, called for the urgency of digital asset users taking caution before approving the transactions. According to the firm, users should check their approvals often. For the old ones, they should cancel them to avoid exposing their funds to scammers, emphasizing the importance of their wallet security. In the highlighted case, the compromised wallet had only seen minimal, low-value transactions up until a month before the theft, making it unlikely to attract immediate attention from scammers. The user decided to move $762,397 into a wallet with the address 0x6c0eB6 from a MetaMask wallet on July 2 at 8:41 PM UTC. Ten minutes later, the user transferred another $146,154 in USDC to the same wallet from a Kraken account. At this time, the scammer was monitoring the movement of the funds, waiting for the right time to attack while giving the user more time to see if she or he could add more funds to the wallet. The attack took place on August 2. Crypto fraud attack raises tension among investors Investigators noted that the scammer used tactics typical of a phishing approval attack , closely monitoring the victim’s transactions before executing the theft. Following such attacks, crypto authorities included stricter measures users should take while approving transactions. For example, they have introduced Etherscan’s Token Approval checker for Ethereum users, enabling them to review and cancel any token approval that is not needed. However, each cancellation process is charged a gas fee. Meanwhile, research from sources reveals that in July alone, the total stolen funds amounted to more than $142 million in the crypto ecosystem. This involves at least 17 attacks, with crypto exchange CoinDCX suffering the highest losses. Still, crypto users are worried about the security of their funds. Some have highlighted that this scammer has not been identified and arrested, which makes them even more worried. Others have called for more security measures to be effected.

2025-08-03 08:36:49,49459286,1754210209,Cardano community greenlights funding to support network upgrades,"The Cardano community has approved funding to support several upgrades on the network. According to reports, the community approved Input Output Engineering’s (IOE) protocol roadmap for treasury funding with about 74% of voters supporting the initiative. In the press release , the platform notes that the initiative is expected to be the first community-authorized core development funding for the blockchain network. The press statement notes that the approval is expected to birth not just a set of technical upgrades, but also a shared vision for the future of Cardano, which is grounded in transparency, accountability, and momentum. The approved roadmap was designed in alignment with community priorities and approved earlier this year, revealing one of the most ambitious development phases in the Chain’s history. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson mentioned at the time that the new approach is expected to introduce agile engineering teams to achieve a faster execution of the platform’s goals. Cardano community greenlights funding to support network upgrades The approved funding is expected to go to major upgrades, focusing on scalability, developer experience, and interoperability. The key developments will include Ouroboros Leios for increased throughput, Hydra for fast and cheap transactions, Mithril improvements for reduced bootstrap times, and Project Acropolis for modular node architecture, which will enable greater flexibility and easier onboarding of new core developers. In addition, there are also plans for performance optimization, which is expected to improve sync times and reduce RAM usage, and nested transactions, which will provide a technical foundation for more advanced smart contracts and seamless interoperability. According to Tim Harrison, the EVP Community & Ecosystem at Input Output, this development is a milestone for the platform. Harrison noted that for the first time, major protocol developments will be funded directly by the community. He noted that the move empowers the firm with the needed confidence to move forward, adding that they need to show “full transparency, shared responsibility, and a renewed commitment to building an open, resilient ecosystem.” New updates will lay the groundwork for better performance These upgrades are expected to lay the groundwork for a more scalable, accessible Cardano with better performance, unlocking new capabilities for builders and users. Aside from delivering on its promises, Cardano is also expected to support wider participation by onboarding external vendors, with most of them expected to join from the Cardano Developer Ecosystem Coalition (CDEC). According to its press statement, Cardano expects to build capacity, transfer knowledge, and help contributors stand as independent proposers in future funding rounds, strengthening decentralization over time. The funding structure is expected to integrate milestone-based payments administered by Intersect, with releases based on verified delivery. IOE will provide monthly updates, engineering timesheets, and quarterly budget reports that will be checked by the community. “Securing this funding is just the start,” said Ricky Rand, General Manager, Input | Output Engineering. “This is a vote of confidence in Cardano’s future—and a model for how decentralized funding and delivery can work at scale. The real work begins now—delivering with integrity, reporting with transparency, and building with and for the community.” Reacting to the update, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, took to blogging platform X to show his support for the development. He thanks the crypto community for their unwavering support, urging them to let them get it done. Meanwhile, crypto community members have also supported the move, with a user noting that the future of the chain is now in the hands of ADA holders, which is a good thing for the project and a vote of confidence for Hoskinson.

2025-08-03 08:34:45,49458730,1754210085,Five Key Factors in XRP Prices Hitting $5 In The Next 5 Months,"That’s what several cryptocurrency market experts and altcoin analysts are predicting for XRP’s price with August already here. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs continues to expand its business as corporations and even the US government move to add XRP to their digital asset portfolios to balance out their treasuries. Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, DC has done a complete 180-degree about-face since Trump’s reelection. The SEC has shifted from an aggressively and relentlessly hostile stance toward Ripple Labs to one that is cooperative and helpful. In addition to that, the company is making enormous strides forward in Q3 2025 to expand its borderless payments business for large transactions between big institutions. XRP Outshines US Stocks in July It’s a very bullish forward view for XRP prices as August begins, especially compared to returns from US stocks, like the benchmark S&P 500 Index. July was a big month for the US stock market, which grew to a historic record high level again on Monday, along with the Nasdaq Composite. That’s despite worries over Trump’s tax reforms and global tariff policies. But XRP holders made significantly greater gains than US stock shareholders in July. The S&P 500 Index delivered +2.67% gains for the 30 days ending Tuesday, July 29. Meanwhile, XRP’s price flew up on crypto exchanges by over +42%, from $2.20 on Jun. 30 to $3.13 on Jul. 29. It’s worth noting, though, that both asset classes slashed some of the gains as July ended and on Autva e gust 1 due to political concerns and economic uncertainty. During most of its history since launching in 1957, S&P 500 Index stocks would typically take four years to deliver those kinds of gains that XRP delivered in 30 consecutive days this summer. That’s not the first time Ripple’s token has given such an incredibly positive performance. Its average trading price performed similarly this past January, last November, and during the Bitcoin bull markets in 2021 and 2017. Here are five key factors analysts are weighing, who say XRP is going as high as $5 in the next five months. 1. Altcoin Analyst Predicts $5 XRP By 2026 Altcoin Daily co-founder Aaron Arnold, in an update posted on July 25, explained that he believes XRP is going to $5 and beyond because it’s not merely a currency, but crucially important digital infrastructure for global payments. He said that Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December 2024, will be a primary driver of XRP’s market gains for the rest of this crypto cycle. Unpopular opinion: Ripple’s RLUSD might be the most underrated stablecoin of 2025 – Went from the #36 stablecoin to #17 ranking in 6 months -604% growth (2nd fastest YTD) – $348M in inflows Even more suprising is that of ~83% RLUSD is on Ethereum, not on Ripple. pic.twitter.com/E1qUMjeedc — J.Hackworth (@jphackworth42) June 19, 2025 Every time there’s a transaction on XRP Ledger, some of the XRP is burned to increase scarcity and create price support for the currency. “Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is the key,” Arnold said. That’s because XRP is a relatively scarce, supply-limited token, and the growth of RLUSD increases the demand for XRP while leaving it in shorter supply. RLUSD has already captured a market cap well north of half a billion dollars in July. All other factors equalized, the Ripple stablecoin’s rapid adoption is good business and economics for XRP valuations to continue rising in 2025. 2. XRP Corporate Treasury Race Begins Meanwhile, as online traders use more XRP to move stablecoins around the blockchain, at least one corporate finance department is raising $20 million in funds to pile up an XRP treasury. Nature’s Miracle Holdings is a California-based farm tech firm that provides equipment for indoor, greenhouse, and vertical farming operations. They’re publicly traded in the United States on OTC Markets, with a very small market cap of less than $2 million. The company announced on 7/23 that it is raising $20 million in an equity finance deal approved by the SEC to stash a corporate XRP treasury. Moreover, that would make it the first non-financial public company to buy a big tranche of XRP. Nature’s Miracle CEO James Li said you can blame the company’s big strategic pivot on Trump and Congress for creating more regulatory clarity around blockchain with the GENIUS Act. “We see the huge potential of XRP as it improves the speed and reduces the cost of cross-border payments,” Li said. 3. Ripple Pump Incoming From US Stockpile BIG: White House to unveil national crypto stockpile report this Wednesday! $XRP rumored to be on the list alongside BTC & ETH. Is XRP becoming a strategic U.S. digital asset? pic.twitter.com/sOywwGNF5S — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) July 27, 2025 In addition to corporate treasury interest in XRP stockpiles, the US federal government wants its hands on Ripple tokens. In fact, President Trump has specifically named XRP as one of the assets the White House wants to hold in trust for Americans. The White House’s crypto report on blockchain and the national digital assets stockpile, released on July 30, provides solid support for XRP price levels. Meanwhile, Americans applying for federal housing loans are now permitted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to list crypto like XRP as financial assets while holding them, without selling them for cash instead. So the US government is shaping up to be a massive bull factor in XRP prices for the remainder of 2025, as well as going forward up to 2030 and beyond. 4. Ripple New US Patent: A Threat to SWIFT? JUST IN: Ripple secures U.S. patent for trust-based, instant cross-border payments—no full network confirmation needed. $XRP might slowly replace SWIFT, offering a faster and more efficient alternative. pic.twitter.com/op8Yn1sfQy — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) July 27, 2025 RippleNet and XRP Ledger are global, borderless, automated payment and financial networks. Across the pond from the US, Ripple is expanding its business in Europe as well. In July, a representative from Ripple told journalists the company is applying for a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe for regulatory compliance. Consequently, the company will find it easier to expand its operations in the Eurozone. Moreover, Ripple got US Patent No. 11,998,003 approved in July for an international payments network that settles much faster than the world’s most popular cross-border payments rails, based out of Belgium, SWIFT. Running the math on it, if XRP payments using RippleNet and XRP Ledger capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share for daily transaction services, XRP’s price could go to Mars and Jupiter. 5. Bitcoin Bull Run to $150K-200K In 2025 Finally, if Bitcoin’s price rises to $175,000 or $200,000, as many professional market analysts believe it will, it could be an easy ride up for XRP tokens from $3 a token to $5 XRP in 2025. In fact, XRP’s price gained 518% in just 77 days, the last time Bitcoin rallied 50% from last Nov. 4 to Jan. 20. If it did that again from the current price level, XRP could skyrocket to $19.30.

2025-08-03 08:34:08,49458795,1754210048,"Analyst to XRP Holders: Relax Friends, This Dip Is Almost Over. Here’s why","XRP’s recent decline has unsettled parts of the crypto community, especially after the asset reached a peak of $3.65 in July. Since then, the bullish momentum has cooled considerably. The asset is trading at $2.82, a 5.43% drop from yesterday, having fallen below the psychologically significant $3 support level recently. Despite the sharp downturn, not all analysts are signaling alarm. In a post on X, well-known trader and market analyst CryptoBull shared a 4-hour chart suggesting that XRP may be approaching the tail end of its current corrective move. According to CryptoBull, “this XRP dip is almost over.” Relax friends, this #XRP dip is almost over. pic.twitter.com/l6wdmoo6Jx — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 2, 2025 A Falling Wedge Forms on the 4-Hour Chart The chart, which covers price action from mid-July to early August, displays a falling wedge formation , a classic technical pattern that often precedes a bullish breakout. The narrowing price action is marked by descending resistance and support lines converging toward the current price. The pattern is visible across multiple lower highs and lower lows, with the recent price action testing the wedge’s lower boundary below $2.8. This setup indicates weakening selling pressure, even as prices decline. Volume analysis within the chart also shows a tapering pattern, consistent with a potential exhaustion of downward momentum. XRP Support Levels Suggest Bearish Exhaustion Although XRP has seen a notable decline from its recent peak , the current chart positioning implies it may be nearing a technical support level. The downward sloping wedge has not yet broken to the upside, but such patterns often act as precursors to bullish reversals once a breakout occurs with conviction and volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, the absence of a confirmed breakout means traders should remain cautious. If XRP fails to hold the lower trendline around $2.7, the price could continue to slide, testing deeper levels of support. On the other hand, if buying pressure increases and XRP breaks above the upper resistance line currently just below $3, it may signal a return of upward momentum. Is An XRP Reversal Coming? CryptoBull’s chart interpretation comes at a moment of uncertainty for XRP holders. While the recent price action has been bearish, the structure shown on the 4-hour chart provides a technical basis for optimism. Other analysts have expressed confidence that XRP’s recovery is imminent , and the next few sessions could prove critical in confirming whether this dip is indeed near its end or if further downside awaits.

2025-08-03 08:15:52,49458130,1754208952,Goldman Sachs Says Hedge Funds Are Ditching Tech Stocks And Jumping Into One Overlooked Sector Instead: Report,"Hedge funds are reportedly fleeing tech stocks at the fastest rate in twelve months, pivoting to a new trade idea. In a note to clients seen by Reuters , Goldman Sachs says hedge funds took profits on their tech positions just as the S&P 500 index hit all-time highs. The bank says tech stocks were sold off by hedge funds in the US and Europe more than any other sector last week, and was the largest exodus from the field since July 2024. Goldman also notes that every type of tech stock was sold, including semiconductor chip companies, software firms and IT service providers. While tech stocks sold off, the bank says hedge funds began shifting their capital to consumer staples, or goods that consumers purchase regularly regardless of the economic climate. Goldman says the big winners included companies that sell food and beverages, and personal care products. Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, tells Reuters that yields on long bonds may determine US equities’ next move, but they haven’t yet flashed any clear signals. “US equities valuations (such as price earnings ratios) are now 30% higher than their recent decade average, while 10-year yields remain stubbornly high and volatile. The future path of equities may depend partly on a decline in long-term rates; however, we do not seem to be there yet.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This correction has sparked a divide among analysts and investors, with some viewing it as a healthy retracement that could set the stage for a continuation of the broader uptrend. Others, however, warn that this move might signal the beginning of a more extended bearish phase if key support levels fail to hold. Related Reading: Ethereum New Addresses Surge To Nearly 257K In A Day, Matching 2017 And 2021 Bull Markets Adding to the market’s uncertainty, top analyst Darkfost highlighted a significant shift in exchange activity. Data reveals that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have been steadily rising since early July, reversing a prolonged downtrend that had been in place since March. Given Binance’s position as the largest global crypto exchange by volume, this uptick in inflows is a crucial indicator of shifting investor behavior. Whether this trend signals an upcoming wave of selling or simply reflects portfolio rebalancing remains to be seen. The coming days will be pivotal as Bitcoin tests its lower demand zones and market sentiment reacts to this new data. Binance Bitcoin Inflows Signal Shift in Market Mood Darkfost shared critical data showing that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have steadily increased, rising from approximately 5,300 BTC daily in early July to 7,000 BTC today. While this uptick is not abrupt, it marks a significant reversal of a prolonged downtrend that had persisted since March. This change suggests that investor behavior is shifting, potentially signaling adjustments in market strategies as traders and institutions respond to evolving market dynamics. Binance, as the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by trading volume, serves as a critical barometer for overall market sentiment. With over 250 million users and billions of dollars in daily transactions, fluctuations in Bitcoin inflows on this platform often mirror broader structural moves within the crypto market. Historically, rising inflows have been associated with increased trading activity, whether due to profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or anticipation of market volatility. Some analysts interpret this emerging trend of accelerating inflows as an early sign of preparation for heightened market volatility or impending macroeconomic shifts. It could indicate that traders are positioning funds on exchanges to either capitalize on price swings or hedge against potential downside risks. While the magnitude of inflows isn’t alarmingly high yet, the consistency of this rise demands attention. The market is watching closely to see whether this signals a temporary adjustment or the start of a broader trend. With Bitcoin’s price currently testing lower support zones after breaking below $115K, the behavior of these inflows will be pivotal in determining short-term price action.

Key Support At Risk Amid Increased Selling Pressure Bitcoin is trading at $112,477 after breaking down from its two-week consolidation range. The price lost the crucial $115,724 support, which now flips into immediate resistance. This breakdown marks a significant shift in momentum, with BTC testing the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $114,944, which failed to hold. The next key support zone lies near the 200-day SMA at $110,348, a level that could become pivotal for bulls attempting to regain control. Volume has surged during this decline, indicating strong selling pressure as BTC approaches the $112,000 level. If the price fails to hold above this zone, a further drop towards the psychological $110K level seems likely, with potential for a deeper correction targeting previous accumulation ranges from early July.

Until then, market sentiment remains cautious as investors watch for signs of demand absorption or further liquidation-driven declines.

2025-08-03 07:58:26,49457460,1754207906,Analyst: I Repeat- $6-$8 XRP Price In August Highly Likely,"While XRP has faced pressure in recent sessions, a new analysis suggests that the current correction could be nearing completion. In a chart posted on August 2, trader and crypto analyst Xoom (@Mr_Xoom) outlined a potential bullish reversal zone as XRP trades around the $2.93 mark. The chart indicates a classic five-wave Elliott Wave pattern , where wave 5 is projected to finalize around $2.8. The chart highlights a series of lower highs and lower lows from late July into early August. After completing Waves 1 to 5, the chart outlines the potential endpoint, which falls around the $2.8 zone that Xoom previously set as the XRP’s lowest point for this cycle. XRP Ltf wave 5 coming to an end. I repeat- $6-$8 XRP in August highly likely. https://t.co/whkoyP1vM5 pic.twitter.com/2lPXPs5ybR — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 2, 2025 Support Zone Under Scrutiny XRP recently experienced a notable decline, falling below the crucial $3 support zone . It has failed to reclaim this level, causing some concern among market participants. Xoom outlined this level on the chart, as it held up XRP in July after the asset retraced from its all-time high . Although XRP has broken through this support, Xoom is confident in the technical structure and anticipates a recovery. Despite the recent decline, XRP has remained above the highlighted support at $2.8, and the current forecast implies that once wave 5 concludes, a larger reversal could follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bearish Momentum is Slowing Down Elliott Wave theory, the analytical framework used in the chart, typically identifies patterns of investor behavior. A completed five-wave downtrend often precedes a corrective rally or a new impulsive move in the opposite direction. In this case, Xoom appears to anticipate the latter, which would imply a significant upside breakout if the projected reversal plays out. At the time of Xoom’s analysis, XRP sat slightly above the $2.8 support, trading around $2.93. The bearish sequence, while still active, appears to be losing momentum, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Outlook for August Remains Bullish Despite the short-term bearish structure, the forecast remains optimistic over the coming weeks. Xoom reiterated his previous target, stating that XRP reaching $6 to $8 in August is highly likely . The projected target range represents a more than 2x increase from current levels at the minimum. While that may seem ambitious, the underlying structure of the wave analysis supports the case for a trend shift if the $2.80 support holds firm.

At the time of reporting, this portion of XRP carries a market capitalization of approximately 28.6 trillion Japanese yen, based on pricing data from July 28. This figure reflects a substantial segment of the total supply and constitutes the portion that is freely tradable across exchanges and platforms. Ripple’s Non-Circulating Holdings As of the end of March 2025, Ripple held a significant volume of XRP that had not entered the market. These holdings are categorized as being outside of current market circulation and are valued at approximately 13.4 trillion yen. By July 20, 2025, the infographic reports that Ripple’s non-circulating holdings are equivalent to 19.7 trillion yen, which suggests that the valuation is based on a revised XRP price as of July 28. These tokens represent a portion of the supply Ripple retains direct control over, yet has not introduced into active trading markets.

Roughly 35.9 billion XRP remain locked under the escrow mechanism. The infographic explains that XRP placed in escrow on the XRP Ledger is restricted from use or destruction until specific conditions are met. The escrow system was established to promote predictability and ensure responsible token release over time. Based on ledger data available as of July 20, 2025, the report confirms that nearly 40% of the total XRP supply is still under escrow, and thus, Ripple is not at liberty to sell or distribute these tokens at will. In addition to circulating and escrowed tokens, the infographic indicates that approximately 10 million XRP have been permanently removed from the total supply through transaction fees. These burned tokens represent a fraction of the total but reflect the deflationary nature of the transaction cost model built into the XRP Ledger. Summary of Data Presentation and Source The quantities shown in the infographic are derived from XRP Ledger data as of July 20, 2025, and the monetary valuations are calculated using XRP’s market price as of July 28. WrathofKahneman referred to the updated image as “still the best infographic about total XRP circulation,” highlighting its clarity and the credibility of its source, which is SBI Holdings. The visual report illustrates the current landscape of XRP distribution in quantifiable detail and offers transparency on Ripple’s available and restricted holdings.

2025-08-03 07:19:07,49457457,1754205547,BlackRock and Ripple Are Acting In Sync Quietly but on a Massive Scale,"Crypto enthusiast Cosmos has presented a detailed analysis asserting that Ripple and BlackRock are acting in coordination to reshape the financial system through tokenization. According to Cosmo, both entities are quietly aligning operations, timelines, and personnel to build a tokenized infrastructure that affects not just financial instruments, but also identity, medical data, and global market architecture. The claims, supported by multiple references to known partnerships and developments, attempt to demonstrate a systemic realignment of the digital asset space led by Ripple and BlackRock. Cosmo opens the thread by stating that BlackRock and Ripple have “just been exposed,” and suggests they are using tokenization as a vehicle to control financial markets. The tweet asserts that the same assets are being targeted, within the same timeframe, and involving the same key players behind both initiatives. The central argument is that this coordinated effort is being largely overlooked despite its significant implications for crypto holders and the broader financial ecosystem. Ripple’s Role in Tokenizing Traditional Assets Cosmo traces the beginning of this effort to Ripple’s early work in tokenizing U.S. Treasury bonds using the XRP Ledger . This was done through the OUSG fund, which is accessible in tokenized form on-chain 24/7. According to Cosmo, this marks a fundamental shift in how traditional securities are accessed and transferred. He further notes that BlackRock has allocated capital into this very fund, highlighting their indirect participation in the XRPL tokenization effort . 1^ ✰ BlackRock and Ripple are acting in sync – quietly but on a massive scale ✰ They are launching tokenization to rewrite the financial system ✰ Same assets – same timeline – same people – and no one is asking questions pic.twitter.com/OqcdS41fhA — Cosmo (@0xcosmobtc) July 31, 2025 Ondo Finance is identified as the intermediary platform responsible for launching the OUSG token. Cosmo describes Ondo as a fintech project led by former Goldman Sachs executives. The role breakdown, as Cosmo explains, places Ripple as the provider of the blockchain infrastructure, Ondo as the issuer of the tokenized instruments, and BlackRock as the source of capital liquidity. He also notes that Ripple’s legal clarity following its partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 was a strategic milestone that enabled this expansion into institutional partnerships. New Developments Involving Bio-Identification and the XRP Ledger A point of coincidence emphasized by Cosmo is the ticker symbol $XDNA. BlackRock currently has a genetics ETF trading under this ticker. Meanwhile, on July 4, 2025, a token with the same ticker, $XDNA, is set to launch on the XRP Ledger. Cosmo states that this new token is being issued by DNA Protocol and is centered on biometric identity infrastructure, medical data access, and genomics, rather than trading. He states that the XRPL will serve as the foundational blockchain for this infrastructure, further demonstrating Ripple’s reach into areas beyond finance. This development, according to Cosmo, represents the convergence of healthcare data, biometric identification, and tokenized infrastructure within a single blockchain environment. He notes that this should not be viewed in isolation but rather as an extension of Ripple’s broader role in building systems for the next era of digital infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock’s Expanding Blockchain Integration Cosmo also refers to the ISO 20022 messaging standard , currently being implemented by FedWire, SWIFT, and global banks. He points out that Ripple’s systems have been compatible with ISO 20022 from inception. In contrast, BlackRock’s Aladdin software, which manages over $20 trillion in assets, is now testing blockchain networks for settlement and transaction tracking. Cosmos states that XRPL supports ISO 20022 and operates without interruption, positioning it as a viable base layer for next-generation financial systems. According to Cosmo, the two firms are dividing responsibilities across multiple verticals. Ripple is focusing on the tokenization of government bonds, central bank digital currencies, land, and carbon markets. BlackRock is focusing on tokenizing equities, U.S. treasuries, real estate, and digital identity. Cosmo interprets this as a dual effort to reboot the global financial system from the ground up, operating in unison but through separate domains. Effect on the Broader Crypto Market In the final portion of the thread, Cosmo argues that the implications of this transformation affect all crypto holders. He says that anyone holding assets like Ethereum or Solana is already part of this evolving structure, regardless of whether they are aware. Cosmo warns that the shift is not about adopting a new market, but rather transitioning the current system into a more centralized form under different management. He ends the thread with a caution that this transformation is not optional. According to his view, tokenization led by Ripple and BlackRock is already in motion, and retail participants are being absorbed into an institutional framework without a clear understanding of the broader design.

2025-08-03 07:12:20,49457384,1754205140,Dogecoin Dragged Lower by Outflows With Technicals Flagging Bearish Continuation,"Dogecoin fell 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), slipping from $0.20 to as low as $0.19 amid sharp spikes in trading activity and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins. What to Know DOGE traded in a volatile $0.01 range (7.14%) during the session, declining from $0.20 to $0.19 before staging a mild bounce. Volume surged to 918.53M at 06:00 and 502.81M at 14:00, both exceeding the 24H average of 385.67M, signaling high-conviction exits. Support formed around $0.188–$0.190, where volume spiked to 667.44M, enabling a brief recovery to $0.194. Resistance held at $0.202–$0.203, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. News Background DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets. Price Action Summary High: $0.203 Low: $0.188 Close: $0.195 24H Range: $0.015 (7.14%) Technical Analysis DOGE encountered aggressive resistance at the $0.202–$0.203 zone, rejecting multiple rallies. The $0.188–$0.190 region absorbed peak selling pressure, with high-volume prints suggesting bottom-fishing or accumulation interest. The final 60-minute session (03:55–04:54) saw a measured 0.53% drop from $0.196 to $0.195, with intra-candle resistance at $0.1963 and support near $0.1952. Volumes normalized late in the session, but remain above baseline, indicating potential for continued volatility.

As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

Currently, buyers are accumulating heavily, resulting in a consolidation. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price declines toward $0.54 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price attempted to maintain momentum above $0.66. As a result, buyers are now holding dYdX price around resistance lines, preparing for further upward push. The 24-hour volume surged to $5.07 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.539, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around 38, hinting that sellers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price below the EMA trend lines. Currently, sellers are holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.18, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.684049 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.670481 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.653003 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.655128 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.578797 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.613287 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.71533 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.602108 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.592156 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.589295 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.602966 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.663086 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.804666 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.024835 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6081, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6621. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5036, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4396. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers lost confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.54 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.5 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX, the leading decentralized trading platform, announced its partnership with Crypto.com’s Onchain app. It is Crypto.com’s non-custodial digital asset wallet, enabling quick access to advanced trading features directly within mobile phone. dYdX price prediction August 2025 July was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain its buying momentum. As a result, dYdX recorded over 3% decline in July. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.9 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $1.2, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction August 2025 $0.45 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Houston resident Sharon Schoolcraft says she lost $13,000 after receiving a call from someone claiming to be working at Wells Fargo, reports FOX 26. Schoolcraft says the caller alerted her to possible fraudulent charges made to her account, a facade made believable by the fact that the scammer knew about recent charges she had legitimately made. The scammer subsequently told Schoolcraft that someone would come to her home to cut up or collect her cut-up Wells Fargo debit card. Similar scams have affected other Wells Fargo customers. Recent reports suggest a trend of scammers convincing the bank’s customers that their accounts are at risk, tricking them into giving up their PINs, cutting up their bank cards and then meeting someone in person to hand over the cut-up cards so the thieves can either withdraw funds or transfer money out of the accounts. In previous instances, when requesting a refund from the bank, the victims were denied by Wells Fargo. However, the bank’s decision changed when the media investigated the matter. Similarly, Wells Fargo only agreed to refund Schoolcraft her stolen $13,000 after the media got involved. Says Schoolcraft, “I’m so super stoked, it’s going to mean a lot to me. I can pay back the person I had to borrow money from. I can get my bills back on track.

The FCA had previously barred retail access to crypto ETNs in 2021, citing investor protection concerns. However, with the market maturing and some crypto investment products now better understood, the regulator said it will allow access, provided the ETNs are listed on recognized, FCA-approved U.K.-based exchanges. Products must follow financial promotion rules to prevent misleading advertising and inappropriate incentives. The FCA’s Consumer Duty rules, which require firms to avoid causing foreseeable harm, will apply. The FCA warned, however, that there won’t be coverage under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for these products. The move comes after retail investors gained access to a plethora of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) overseas in the U.S. These funds, per SoSoValue data , have already accumulated $146.4 billion in total net assets.",Policy|Financial Conduct Authority|exchange-traded note|Retail investor|News,EN,1,retail investor soon able buy crypto note cetns new rule financial conduct authority fca set take effect fca previously barred retail access crypto etns citing investor protection concern however market maturing crypto investment product better understood regulator said allow access provided etns listed recognized exchange product must follow financial promotion rule prevent misleading advertising inappropriate incentive fca consumer duty rule require firm avoid causing foreseeable harm apply fca warned however coverage financial service compensation scheme product move come retail investor gained access plethora cryptocurrency fund etf overseas fund per sosovalue data already accumulated billion total net asset,0.094,0.773,0.133,0.3182,1

2025-08-03 06:30:06,49457461,1754202606,Top 3 Most Undervalued Cryptocurrencies to Watch Right Now,"While Bitcoin dominates headlines, some of the most promising crypto opportunities are hiding in plain sight—trading well below their all-time highs and quietly setting up for major upside. As seasoned investors look for high-upside entry points, one fast-growing project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has caught attention for its explosive growth metrics and expanding user base. Ethereum’s Rebound Hasn’t Hit Its Ceiling Yet Ethereum (ETH) remains one of the most fundamentally sound assets in crypto, yet it’s still undervalued relative to its potential. Currently priced at $3,740, ETH is trading more than 20% below its all-time high of $4,720. Meanwhile, corporate holdings of Ethereum have surpassed $10 billion, and ETF inflows remain steady. Despite that bullish backdrop, technical momentum remains neutral, with an RSI of ~31, suggesting room for upward movement once buy-side volume picks up. A clean breakout above $4,000 could trigger rapid continuation. One New Project Is Quickly Escaping Hidden Gem Status Among altcoins seeing fast-tracked growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out of obscurity. According to on-chain metrics, MAGACOIN has recently crossed multiple internal benchmarks for user acquisition, transaction volume, and community engagement. A newly completed third-party blockchain audit has also positioned the project as a top-tier safety pick —a factor that has drawn attention from cautious but ROI-focused investors. $2,500 deployed here could turn into $50,000 , based on similar market cap trajectories seen in early-stage coins that achieved wide exchange listings. Cardano’s Discount May Not Last Long Cardano (ADA) is another altcoin hovering well below its peak, currently priced at just $0.75—a far cry from its former all-time high of $3.01. Despite recent bearish action bringing ADA down to around $0.743, RSI levels near 30.27 indicate heavy overselling. Historically, similar RSI readings have preceded major recoveries for ADA. Its strong developer activity and continued expansion into smart contracts make it a serious contender for long-term gains if it can reclaim investor confidence. Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano remain undervalued giants with significant recovery potential. But the real momentum may be forming around MAGACOIN FINANCE, now gaining recognition as one of the safest and most promising new altcoin investments . For investors hunting undervalued assets with strong growth curves, these three should be on the radar right now.

2025-08-03 06:10:09,49457381,1754201409,Trump Media Confirms $2B Bitcoin Treasury and $300M Options Strategy in Q2 2025 Earnings Report,"Trump Media and Technology Group (Nasdaq: DJT) disclosed Friday that it now holds $2 billion in bitcoin and bitcoin-related securities, officially confirming one of the largest digital asset treasuries among U.S.-listed companies. The announcement came via the company’s second quarter of 2025 earnings press release , which also mentioned $3.1 billion in total financial assets and its first-ever quarter of positive operating cash flow. The crypto holdings were first disclosed in a separate press release dated July 21. The company also said it has allocated $300 million toward an options-based strategy focused on bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets, signaling ongoing intent to expand its exposure. According to the July 21 release, this strategy could allow Trump Media to convert options into spot BTC “depending on market conditions,” and potentially use the resulting positions for revenue generation or further crypto accumulation. The $2 billion figure cited includes not only spot bitcoin but also bitcoin-related securities, such as bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bitcoin trusts, or derivatives that offer BTC exposure. These instruments allow institutional investors to gain indirect access to bitcoin price movements while avoiding direct custody or on-chain interaction. By combining these securities with spot bitcoin, Trump Media has constructed a hybrid crypto treasury intended to offer both liquidity and resilience. The second quarter also marked the company’s first quarter of positive operating cash flow, with $2.3 million generated through its media and technology operations. Total financial assets reached $3.1 billion, fueled primarily by the crypto treasury build-up and a recent private placement backed by 50 institutional investors. CEO Devin Nunes said that the liquidity and “financial freedom” afforded by this capital will help Trump Media pursue a range of product expansions, including a Truth+ streaming bundle, AI integrations, and a planned utility token for payments within the Truth Social ecosystem. The company also reiterated its goal of launching multiple crypto-focused ETFs and managed investment products.

2025-08-03 06:00:16,49457437,1754200816,"Top Cryptos to Buy Today That Are Breaking Out on Huge Volume Waves: BDAG,ETH, MATIC & AVAX!","Bitcoin has reclaimed key levels and Ethereum is climbing close to $4,000 again, sparking renewed interest across the crypto market. While these dominant names attract attention, traders are now gravitating toward newer Layer 1 projects offering better utility and growth potential. One project gaining serious traction is BlockDAG. It stands apart from typical presales by showcasing a live testnet, 2 million+ active mobile miners, and over 4,500 developers building real dApps. Currently priced at only $0.0016, BDAG promises a staggering 3,025% ROI, with early buyers already witnessing a 2,660% surge since batch 1. This price holds until August 11th, adding urgency for buyers. BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active and features a “NO VESTING PASS” offer, giving users full token access at launch. In this article, we’ll stack up Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BlockDAG to see which ones stand among the top cryptos to buy today. BlockDAG (BDAG) Few projects have managed to turn heads the way BlockDAG (BDAG) has. With presale funding exceeding $359 million and over 24.6 billion coins sold, this project is gathering steam as it nears its global rollout. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0016, which stays active until August 11th, while the official listing price remains $0.05, a setup that offers a powerful 3,025% profit window. BDAG has already delivered 2,660% gains to early supporters since batch 1. The “NO VESTING PASS” sweetens the deal, allowing holders to unlock 100% of their coins immediately upon launch. But what truly separates BlockDAG is its existing infrastructure, a fully functioning testnet, over 2 million miners using the X1 app, and 18,000+ plug-and-play X10 miners sold. With more than 300 applications already in development from 4,500+ builders, BlockDAG’s traction speaks volumes. This isn’t just an idea, it’s a full-blown, ready-to-use ecosystem, making it one of the top cryptos to buy today based on current momentum, structure, and timing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto market and continues showing strong upward signs. The recent 3% rise over 24 hours brings ETH close to the $4,000 zone. What’s fueling this? A massive $1.59 billion in ETF inflows within a week, plus heightened interest from institutions. Following a low of $3,530 in late July, ETH has surged over 61% in the past month. The reduction in exchange balances, down more than 1 million ETH in 30 days, points to reduced sell pressure. Options traders are equally optimistic, with calls far outpacing puts and target ranges between $4,000 and $6,000. While it’s a strong performer, Ethereum’s maturity could limit fast gains. For those who want explosive growth potential rather than gradual returns, newer options like BlockDAG may currently offer better upside. Still, ETH retains its place among the top cryptos to buy today for reliability and long-term value. Polygon (MATIC / POL) MATIC is staying relevant in discussions about the top cryptos to buy today. With a trading price near $0.2166 and a modest 2.6% gain, Polygon remains in motion. A notable 141% jump in USDC transfers confirms its strong presence in stablecoin and scaling infrastructure. Polygon hasn’t made headlines this week, but its zkEVM development and continuing partnerships keep the momentum alive. Current trading volume stands around $280 million, and price charts show strong consolidation between $0.40 and $0.42, signaling potential breakout if metrics align. That said, while Polygon is steady, some might view newer presale-stage cryptos like BlockDAG as more attractive for short-term gains. MATIC remains part of the top cryptos to buy today, but buyers chasing higher ROI may look elsewhere. Avalanche (AVAX) AVAX has seen a strong 6% price jump in the last 24 hours, climbing to about $26.40 with daily trading volume over $1.1 billion. The push is largely linked to ETF rumors and the successful launch of the Octane upgrade, which cut C-Chain gas fees by 42.7% and enhanced performance. Avalanche is also prioritizing security and development. Octane Security, which is now active, brings AI-driven audits into the dev workflow, reducing bugs and deployment risks. This has made AVAX more attractive to builders. Meanwhile, derivatives markets show growing open interest, with $835 million currently locked in. Still, compared to BlockDAG’s early-stage price and live features, Avalanche might not deliver the same explosive ROI. While AVAX is dependable, those searching for top cryptos to buy today with higher upside potential may favor BDAG’s offering. Final Take! Choosing among the top cryptos to buy today depends on your appetite for stability versus speed. Ethereum continues to dominate headlines and institutional flows, Polygon offers scalable tech, and Avalanche is turning heads with its development stack. But BlockDAG combines key elements like adoption, working products, and one of the most appealing presale prices in the market. With batch 29 priced at $0.0016 until August 11th, and a 3,025% return window leading up to the $0.05 listing, the math is hard to ignore. Add in the “NO VESTING PASS,” and it’s clear why buyers are racing in. For anyone eyeing fast gains with an already active project, BlockDAG is shaping up as one of the top cryptos to buy today before the window narrows any further.

2025-08-03 06:00:06,49457458,1754200806,XRP Whales Are Buying This New Altcoin for Major Profits,"As XRP continues to show strength in both spot and futures markets, large holders appear to be hedging their bets by diversifying into a promising new altcoin. With institutional confidence returning and the U.S. regulatory climate turning more favorable, market participants are preparing for what could be another major rally. Early indicators point to a quiet accumulation phase—especially among crypto whales—focused on one emerging opportunity that’s quickly drawing attention. One of those projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has emerged as a clear standout. Its momentum is fueled by surging demand and early allocation phases that are closing faster than expected, signaling that whales aren’t waiting around for broader access. XRP Sees Renewed Momentum as Regulatory Fog Clears XRP has regained its footing after a turbulent year, with recent data showing a rise in both liquidity and trading volume. Whales in particular have resumed accumulation, suggesting renewed confidence in Ripple’s legal clarity and the potential for new financial products involving XRP. On the derivatives side, XRP perpetual futures have overtaken Solana on multiple exchanges—a key indicator of growing speculative interest. Spot prices have also surged in response to positive market sentiment tied to potential institutional partnerships and broader crypto-friendly U.S. policies. Analysts are watching for a decisive move above the $3.60 mark to confirm bullish continuation. While XRP attracts traders with strong fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where many early investors see explosive potential . With access windows closing rapidly, a growing number of whales are moving capital into the project before it reaches large-scale visibility. Momentum has grown to the point that allocation rounds are selling out faster than expected , leaving latecomers scrambling. This pattern of fast-paced participation resembles what was seen during the early surges of now-legendary tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s expanding community, fast-paced growth, and comparison to SHIBA INU’s early days make it a top candidate for high-yield speculation. According to multiple trend trackers, entry points available now are unlikely to last long— timing is critical . Whales Are Positioning Themselves Early With crypto markets heating up again, experienced players are combining stability bets like XRP with high-ROI bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This two-pronged strategy of risk-balanced investing is becoming increasingly common, particularly among large-scale holders looking to front-run retail inflows. Whale tracking wallets have shown that some of the same XRP addresses accumulating during the 2020–2021 cycle are now deploying capital into low-cap altcoins, signaling that the smart money is already positioning itself for the next breakout. Conclusion XRP’s resurgence amid a friendlier U.S. crypto climate is attracting both traders and long-term holders. However, it’s the parallel whale activity in MAGACOIN FINANCE that has drawn the most intrigue from market watchers. With entry phases closing rapidly and investor interest at all-time highs , this altcoin is shaping up to be a rare opportunity ahead of its full-scale debut.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $110,621, beginning a bearish trend to $107,181. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as sellers triggered strong pressure toward $114K. The recent highs triggered strong selling demand among holders. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $812.25 million in net outflows on Friday, marking the second-largest single-day loss in the history of these products. Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,1,key takeaway bitcoin price face volatility around bitcoin price

2025-08-03 05:45:34,49457456,1754199934,Crypto Whales Just Flagged These 4 Best Meme Coins in 2025 for Potential Moonshots,"What do crypto whales, meme coin analysts, and savvy traders all have in common right now? They’re quietly accumulating positions in a fresh batch of meme coins that could dominate headlines in the coming months. With sentiment heating up, four projects have stood out as the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to rising social buzz, strong communities, and unique narratives. While some of these coins are already riding market momentum, one is still in its early whitelist phase, attracting serious attention for offering early access perks. Let’s dive into the four picks that crypto whales are watching for massive upside potential. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Whitelist-Only Access to the Bulls’ Den There’s one project that hasn’t launched yet, and that’s exactly why it’s getting flagged by insiders. MoonBull is quickly emerging as one of the best meme coins in 2025, thanks to its whitelist-only access model and intense buildup ahead of launch. This Ethereum-based meme coin was made for degens chasing breakout gains. But unlike other tokens flooding the market, MoonBull isn’t offering a public presale. Only whitelisted users can join the launch, and here’s what makes that a big deal: Lowest possible entry price for early adopters Secret staking rewards reserved only for whitelisted wallets Bonus token allocations that aren’t publicly disclosed Private roadmap hints available exclusively to early community members In short, the project is keeping its cards close, and that exclusivity is creating serious momentum. The idea? Get whitelisted or miss your shot. The signup process is simple: users drop their email into the secure whitelist form and get a private alert ahead of Stage One. Why This Coin Made the List MoonBull’s structure is tailor-made for big moves. With limited access, a capped supply, and early-stage excitement building, it’s no wonder that crypto whales have started circling early. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a ticket into a high-energy ecosystem that’s primed for an explosive start. 2. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): Solana’s Viral Tribute to a Fallen Hero Meme coins often reflect the culture of the moment, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a perfect example. Launched on the Solana blockchain, this token is a tribute to a real-life squirrel named Peanut, whose story captured the internet’s attention and sparked a viral movement. What makes PNUT stand out isn’t just its narrative, but how it’s turned emotional resonance into community action. The project channels public sentiment into something tangible: a meme coin that doubles as a symbol of animal advocacy. Its performance on Solana has been steady, and its meme appeal continues to pull in new supporters. Forums, TikTok, and X have been keeping PNUT alive in the conversation as the broader market eyes new narratives. Why did this coin make it to this list? PNUT combines a powerful backstory with a growing user base, making it one of the best meme coins in 2025 for emotional engagement and long-term potential. 3. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): A Gospel of Memes and AI on Solana Next up is Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), a Solana meme coin that’s turning heads with its hilarious and chaotic “Goat Gospel” theme. Powered by a custom AI bot known as the Truth Terminal, GOAT delivers a daily dose of internet chaos, humor, and meme prophecy. This project leans fully into meme culture, embracing randomness and absurdity as a virtue. It doesn’t pretend to have traditional utility, its entire value proposition is entertainment, virality, and the strength of its community. GOAT has built a devoted cult following, and its unique approach is keeping it relevant in a sea of meme clones. Why did this coin make it to this list? GOAT is one of the best meme coins in 2025 for its commitment to pure meme energy and viral AI-generated storytelling, a combo that’s clearly working. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Cult Classic With Pink Hat Power Dogwifhat (WIF) might sound silly at first, and that’s exactly the point. Born from a Shiba Inu wearing a pink hat, WIF has grown into a cultural icon on Solana. It doesn’t offer staking or burning mechanisms, and it doesn’t claim to solve complex problems. What it does offer is a passionate community and consistent attention on social platforms. WIF has proven that even simple concepts can lead to big runs, as long as the community stays active and the memes keep flowing. It’s been one of Solana’s standout meme coins, and it’s still getting volume. Why did this coin make it to this list? WIF earns its spot among the best meme coins in 2025 by showing how meme strength and community loyalty can build lasting relevance without needing utility. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the best meme coins in 2025 are MoonBull , Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), and Dogwifhat (WIF). While each has its own distinct personality, one stands out for offering early access perks that no other project can match. MoonBull is still in its whitelist phase, and that makes it uniquely positioned for high potential gains. With exclusive benefits, limited spots, and a stealth-mode rollout, MoonBull offers the kind of opportunity traders dream of, but only if they act fast. The clock’s ticking. The bulls are charging. Will you be there when MoonBull lifts off? For More Information: Website : https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram : https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter : https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What makes MoonBull different from other meme coins? MoonBull offers whitelist-only access, meaning early users get in at the lowest price with exclusive staking rewards and bonus tokens before the public ever sees it. Why are analysts watching these meme coins in 2025? These coins combine strong community support, narrative appeal, and bullish momentum, three key ingredients analysts consider for potential moonshots. How can I join the MoonBull whitelist?

2025-08-02 19:35:23,49437843,1754163323,"OPEC+ plans to increase oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in September","OPEC+ has reached a preliminary agreement to raise oil production by 548,000 barrels per day starting in September, according to Bloomberg. The plan is expected to be formally approved when the alliance meets virtually on Sunday. This increase is the final piece in reversing the 2.2 million bpd cut that eight of its members had implemented last year. It also includes an additional production bump specifically for the United Arab Emirates, which is getting phased in separately. The decision marks the continuation of OPEC’s clear pivot away from supporting prices to pumping more barrels into a market still digesting economic shocks and political pressure. This follows a string of aggressive supply increases that began back in April, right after President Donald Trump triggered market volatility with his “Liberation Day” trade tariff push. Oil futures had dropped to their lowest levels in four years following that announcement, and OPEC+ responded by speeding up its existing timeline to unwind cuts. Accelerated production reversal deepens global supply concerns By July, the group had already advanced its monthly production hikes, and now this planned 548,000 bpd addition for September will fully undo last year’s supply cut. But even as this round gets wrapped up, markets are already eyeing the next wave of withheld oil. There’s still 1.66 million bpd of output that remains formally shut in until the end of 2026, and traders are betting that could be brought back earlier if current trends hold. For now, more oil is on the way. And the consequences are being felt. On Friday, Brent crude dropped $2.03 to $69.67 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate fell $1.93 to $67.33, as fears of additional supply combined with weak U.S. economic data. That data came from the Labor Department, which reported the country only added 73,000 jobs in July, well below expectations. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. These numbers rattled investors already worried about softening demand. Despite the price drop, oil still gained for the week. Brent finished up nearly 6%, and WTI climbed 6.29%, thanks to strong summer demand. But that might not last long. Analysts are already warning about the possibility of a global surplus later this year. More barrels from OPEC+, combined with cooling economies, could tip the market back into oversupply. Gas prices are already falling. Benchmark retail gasoline prices in the U.S. dipped in July, and this fresh OPEC+ move could keep them sliding. That’s a short-term win for consumers, and politically convenient for Trump, who’s been hammering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Russia and Saudi Arabia reinforce OPEC+ alliance amid tensions At the same time, Trump’s team is threatening to impose secondary sanctions on any country that continues to import Russian crude unless there’s a ceasefire in Ukraine. That threat could disrupt flows and push prices back up, the exact opposite of Trump’s goal to keep energy costs down. To avoid fractures inside OPEC+, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak made a rare trip to Riyadh on Thursday, where he met with Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. The two discussed energy cooperation between their countries, reinforcing their leadership within the nearly decade-old alliance. That partnership will be key as OPEC+ navigates the next phase of production policy. While three people with direct knowledge of the group’s internal talks said the 548,000 bpd figure is likely to be locked in this weekend, one person said the final volume is still being debated and could end up slightly lower. What’s clear is that OPEC is moving quickly. After years of defending prices, the group is now focused on reclaiming market share, even if that risks another supply glut. With demand looking shaky and politics heating up, the next few months could decide how long this aggressive production strategy holds.

2025-08-02 19:30:00,49438171,1754163000,XLM could hit $1.50 though some believe a stealth ISO-20022 play is better positioned,"Stellar (XLM) has shown fresh signs of life, with analysts now eyeing a possible run toward $1.50. But while XLM price sentiment turns cautiously optimistic, a stealth ISO-20022 contender is quietly gaining serious traction. Remittix (RTX) is being dubbed the real game-changer for cross-border payments, and some believe it could outpace Stellar’s rally entirely. Here’s why investors are watching both, but betting bigger on one. Can XLM price prediction still reach $1.50? Despite recent volatility, XLM price today sits at a pivotal turning point. Stellar dipped over 5% in the last 24 hours, reflecting broader market softness. Yet behind the scenes, things are shifting. Stellar news just dropped a bombshell—Visa has officially added Stellar to its stablecoin settlement platform, joining Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This is no minor update. It’s a clear signal that Visa sees Stellar price potential beyond just speculation. With its low-cost, high-speed design, Stellar is now a preferred rail for institutional settlements. That puts XLM news ahead of XRP, which remains excluded from Visa’s latest rollout. And in the eyes of traders, this changes the game. Analyst Ali Martinez spotted a bullish flag forming, often a sign of incoming momentum. If it breaks, XLM price prediction could aim for $0.80, with some whispering about $1.50 if institutional use deepens. This isn’t just about hype anymore. It’s about positioning. Remittix may outpace Stellar in real adoption While Stellar price prediction circles $1.50, a lesser-known ISO-20022 contender is quietly gaining speed. Remittix (RTX) doesn’t try to imitate legacy systems—it replaces them. The platform strips away the red tape of global finance and replaces it with instant crypto-to-fiat payments that settle straight to bank accounts. No delays. No nonsense. Unlike Stellar (XLM), which still relies heavily on partnerships for momentum, Remittix builds from the ground up. It supports over 30 fiat currencies, works with 50+ crypto pairs, and skips the need for centralized exchanges or hidden conversion fees. Its real value? Simplicity. Analysts now label it a stealth ISO-20022 play—one that banks on utility, not promises. The $17.9 million already raised reflects that investors are paying attention. Token demand surged past 578 million units at a base price of $0.0895, and whales are now eyeing its beta wallet launch on September 15, 2025. Here’s why Remittix is gaining steam fast: Works with crypto and fiat, no middlemen involved Avoids delays with direct-to-bank settlement Maintains flat, transparent fees unlike banks Launches beta wallet product in September 2025 The crypto market often rewards flash. But Remittix is winning over smart money with function. While XLM news highlights another big-name partnership, Remittix quietly solves what people actually care about—getting paid. That’s why it’s being called the best crypto under $1 that nobody sees coming.

2025-08-02 19:24:36,49440664,1754162676,"CoinMarketCap Listing Makes Ruvi AI (RUVI) One Of The Fastest Presales, Analysts See Solana’s (SOL) Success Soon As It Aims At $1 Evaluation","Solana’s (SOL) meteoric rise to prominence showed the world how an innovative blockchain project could dominate the altcoin market. Now, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is on track to deliver the next big success story. Since its CoinMarketCap (CMC) debut, Ruvi AI has stunned the market with jaw-dropping presale numbers, selling over 1 million tokens daily and achieving 70% completion of its Phase 2 presale. With an impending 33% price increase slated to push token costs from $0.015 to $0.020, Ruvi AI is pacing toward massive growth potential. Analysts are already dubbing it the next Solana, forecasting a $1 valuation that could generate life-changing returns for early investors. How the CoinMarketCap Listing Changed the Game Being listed on CoinMarketCap isn’t just a badge of credibility, it’s a gateway to visibility in the world of crypto. For Ruvi AI, the CMC spotlight provided a significant boost, opening the floodgates to crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors. This transformation didn’t just drive momentum; it established Ruvi AI as one of the fastest-selling tokens in 2025. By the Numbers: 70% of Phase 2 sold out: Over 210 million tokens have already been purchased. 1 million tokens sold daily: A metric that showcases investor demand unlike anything seen before. $2.6 million raised so far: Cementing Ruvi AI’s record-breaking presale momentum. With Phase 2 nearing completion, the subsequent 33% price increase will set the stage for even greater interest as the token price moves to $0.020. Why Ruvi AI Could Follow Solana’s Path Ruvi AI isn’t just another altcoin, it’s a project brimming with real-world applications, AI-driven innovation, and scalability. These features set it apart in today’s crypto market, where utility matters more than hype. For investors who watched Solana rise, Ruvi AI represents a golden opportunity to capitalize early on the next blockchain sensation. Key Features That Set Ruvi AI Apart 1. AI-Powered Solutions for Businesses Ruvi AI goes beyond speculative value by offering AI-driven tools that help businesses optimize marketing efforts, boost efficiency, and lower costs. These solutions integrate seamlessly with blockchain, providing transparency and real-world impact. 2. Transparent and Secure Payments for Creators Ruvi AI addresses a massive gap in the gig economy by creating fraud-proof, instantaneous payment systems for freelancers and digital creators. Unlike many altcoins, Ruvi AI solves a concrete problem, bringing the blockchain closer to practical everyday use. 3. Multi-Industry Compatibility While Solana is best known for its speed, Ruvi AI’s versatility is driving adoption in fields like education, healthcare, and finance. Its adaptable platform ensures a long-term growth trajectory far beyond the current presale buzz. By combining utility with innovation, Ruvi AI positions itself as a smart, scalable, and profitable contender that could rival Solana’s upward climb to dominance. Exclusive VIP Bonuses for Early Participants For those who want to maximize their holdings, Ruvi AI’s VIP tier system offers unmatched rewards. Here’s how early investors can enhance their ROI: VIP 2: A $750 investment earns investors 50,000 RUVI tokens at $0.015 each, plus a 40% bonus, totaling 70,000 tokens. At $0.070 (the confirmed listing price), this equals $4,900, and if the tokens hit $1, this equals $70,000, a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3: A higher-tier contribution of $1,500 secures 100,000 tokens plus a 60% bonus, adding 60,000 tokens for a total of 160,000. If the token reaches $1, this investment grows to a staggering $160,000, a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5: A $7,500 investment awards 500,000 tokens and a 100% bonus, making the total 1 million tokens. With a $1 valuation, this amounts to $1 million, a 13,233% return. Leaderboard Rewards For major contributors, Ruvi AI offers leaderboard bonuses ranging from 20,000 to 500,000 extra RUVI tokens. This additional incentive makes early participation even more rewarding, especially as Phase 2’s supply runs low. Built for Security and Longevity While fast-paced growth is exciting, Ruvi AI’s foundation rests on trust and reliability. It recently passed a rigorous audit by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. Key Security Features: Protected Smart Contracts: Designed to resist tampering and vulnerabilities. Transparent Transactions: Investors can trace every token movement on the blockchain, ensuring accountability. With this solid foundation, Ruvi AI inspires confidence in its ability to achieve massive growth while safeguarding investor interests. The Time to Act is Now While Solana’s trajectory has been impressive, Ruvi AI is paving its own path with blazing success. With 1 million tokens selling daily, and Phase 2 nearing its conclusion, this opportunity may be short-lived. The upcoming 33% price increase will raise tokens to $0.020, making now the time to enter before costs rise. Will you watch from the sidelines as others capitalize, or join the movement that could redefine 2025? Take action today and secure your share of cryptocurrency’s next Solana.

Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is Your Second Best Shot As Sales Skyrocket After CoinMarketCap Listing, Over 210M Sold Tokens in No Time","Shiba Inu made headlines with its stunning 100x returns, transforming early adopters into overnight millionaires. But if you missed the boat on SHIB, don’t worry, Ruvi AI (RUVI) could be your next shot at exponential gains. Ruvi AI’s presale is making waves in the crypto market, already selling over 210 million tokens and gaining immense traction after its high-profile CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing. With 1 million tokens selling daily and a 33% price hike looming as Phase 2 ends, investors on the hunt for life-changing returns are racing to secure their piece of this explosive project. Read on to discover why Ruvi AI is shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto, and why acting fast could mean huge rewards. CoinMarketCap Listing Ignites a Frenzy Appearing on CoinMarketCap isn’t just a milestone; it’s a launchpad. Recognized globally as the most trusted crypto-tracking website, CMC’s endorsement instantly validated Ruvi AI, drawing attention from investors worldwide. The result? A rapid acceleration in token sales that few projects in 2025 can rival. What the Numbers Say 70% of Phase 2 Sold: Over 210 million tokens have already been claimed at $0.015 each. $2.6 Million Raised: A presale performance that showcases Ruvi AI’s immense investor appeal. 1 Million Tokens Sold Daily: An unrelenting pace that confirms the token’s growing demand. The window to act is shrinking fast as Phase 3 approaches, which will see prices climb 33% to $0.020. Investing now at the presale phase means maximizing your ROI potential. Can Ruvi AI Deliver Shiba Inu-Level Returns? Shiba Inu succeeded by capitalizing on hype and meme status, but Ruvi AI offers something far more substantial, real-world utility. By combining blockchain transparency with artificial intelligence, Ruvi AI stands out as a token with a purpose, appealing to long-term investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. How Ruvi AI Stands Out 1. Revolutionary AI-Powered Solutions Ruvi AI provides cutting-edge tools that help businesses optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve returns on investment. Unlike Shiba Inu, which relied purely on community-driven campaigns, Ruvi AI solves real issues across industries such as marketing, healthcare, and finance. 2. Transparent Payment Infrastructure Freelancers and digital creators often face payment delays and mismatched expectations. Ruvi AI addresses these gaps with a blockchain-secured payment system that ensures transactions are reliable, instant, and transparent. 3. Broad, Cross-Industry Applications Ruvi AI’s adaptability enables its use in various sectors, positioning it as a token with real, lasting value. Its multi-industry reach ensures there’s more to its story than speculative gains, making it a highly scalable project. Breaking Down the ROI Potential Ruvi AI’s momentum and functionality create significant growth possibilities for both its presale investors and its future community. While it builds on the excitement surrounding SHIB’s wild ride, Ruvi AI distinguishes itself as a project with practical use cases and sustainable appeal. VIP Rewards for Early Adopters To add even more value for investors, Ruvi AI offers an exclusive VIP tier system that amplifies returns for those who buy in early. Here’s how the numbers stack up: VIP 2: Investing $750 gets you 50,000 tokens at $0.015 each, along with a 40% bonus of 20,000 more tokens, bringing your total to 70,000 tokens. When the token reaches a $1 valuation, that translates to a potential return of $70,000, a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3: With a $1,500 investment, you secure 100,000 tokens and a 60% bonus, adding 60,000 tokens to your holdings for a total of 160,000 tokens. At $1 per token, your position could be worth $160,000, an ROI of 10,566%. VIP 5: The top tier rewards $7,500 investors with 500,000 tokens plus a 100% bonus, doubling total holdings to 1,000,000 tokens. If RUVI hits $1, this becomes an incredible $1 million, a 13,233% ROI. Leaderboard Rewards Add Even More For major contributors, Ruvi AI’s leaderboard offers additional incentives, rewarding top buyers with bonuses up to 500,000 extra tokens. The combination of early bird bonuses and leaderboard rewards creates a compelling reason to jump in now. Security You Can Count On While rapid sales and hyped predictions are exciting, security is key for investors seeking long-term gains. Ruvi AI has already passed a comprehensive CyberScope audit, ensuring that its smart contracts and infrastructure are tamper-proof. Key Audit Features Robust, Tamper-Proof Contracts: Designed to safeguard against vulnerabilities or fraud. Blockchain Transparency: Investors can easily trace token movements, creating accountability and trust. This extra layer of security allows Ruvi AI to stand apart from risky altcoins, giving both retail and institutional investors added confidence. Don’t Miss Your Second Chance If Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise taught us anything, it’s that timing is everything. And while SHIB investors may now be enjoying their returns, Ruvi AI is offering a rare opportunity for those who missed out. With 1 million tokens being sold daily and Phase 2 coming to a close, securing your position now could yield life-changing results. This isn’t just another speculative token, it’s an advanced blockchain project with real-world applications, global appeal, and early-stage growth that’s hard to ignore.

Industry analysts are now calling it one of the most promising opportunities for investors this year, thanks to its impressive presale performance, early bonuses, and recent CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing.

2025-08-02 19:14:34,49436380,1754162074,"Weekend Selloff - Here's Why Solana, Cardano And XRP Can Create Fresh Rally Wave On Monday","Crypto enthusiasts witnessed a surprising dip over the weekend, sparking curiosity about potential comebacks. Monday could bring a new wave of growth for Solana , Cardano , and XRP . This article delves into the forces behind this anticipated surge and sheds light on why these specific coins are poised for a fresh rally. Discover the compelling factors at play. Solana Price Insight: Trading Ranges and Market Behavior Solana showed an 8.36% price gain in the past month, contrasting with an 18.78% decline over the previous six months. A weekly drop of 11.52% highlighted short-term challenges while the longer-term picture indicates volatility and mixed market sentiment. Fluctuations during the half-year reveal cautious buying and selling pressure, leading to uneven momentum and sporadic rallies. The gap between recent gains and a broader downtrend suggests improvements in the near term, but the long-term outlook remains unsettled. The coin now trades within a range from $142.76 to $204.07, with resistance at $235.84 and support at $113.22. A second resistance level at $297.15 and additional support at $51.91 provide further reference points. Both bullish and bearish forces are present. The RSI near 43.90 offers little clarity on directional bias, while the Momentum Indicator of -24.25 shows ongoing selling pressure. Traders may look to buy near $113.22 or consider short-term plays around $235.84, as the lack of a clear trend necessitates careful monitoring of these key levels. Cardano (ADA) Market Review: Recent Swings and Current Key Levels Cardano experienced a 24.44% increase in the past month, but a six-month decline of 9.57% highlights the challenges in the long-term outlook. The latest week showed a drop of 10.78%, indicating short-term volatility amid this irregular behavior. Rapid price surges followed by notable pullbacks characterize Cardano's movement, reflecting a market marked by mixed sentiment. While the recent upswing contrasts with the half-year downturn, the overall picture illustrates both resilience and susceptibility to abrupt changes. Current price action places Cardano within a trading corridor from approximately $0.539 at the low end to $0.938 at the high end. Resistance levels are identified at $1.136 and $1.535, while support is noted at $0.338. The Awesome Oscillator suggests slight bullish momentum, though the momentum indicator and RSI indicate ongoing bearish pressure. Price levels between $0.539 and $0.938 present chances for re-entry and profit-taking. Caution is advised as the market lacks a clear trend, with traders advised to watch for moves beyond key levels for better positioning. XRP Rally Hinted by Key Levels and Seasonal Momentum 34.99% monthly growth coupled with a 17.01% gain over the last six months shows XRP undergoing notable price swings. Weekly activity dipped by 3.91%, highlighting short-term consolidation amidst the overall climb. Price fluctuations have demonstrated solid energy over a concentrated period, reflecting a shift from earlier stagnation to a more aggressive upward push recently. The rise in monthly performance stands out against a backdrop of mixed weekly moves, suggesting traders have been active in extracting value from short-term corrections while capitalizing on longer-term trends. Current prices range between $2.23 and $3.74, with a significant resistance level at $4.45 and a secondary hurdle at $5.97 that could signal further upside if breached. Support is clearly marked at $1.43, serving as a safety net in case of a downturn. Technical indicators show mixed sentiment; a momentum reading of -0.167 along with an Awesome Oscillator of 0.192 suggests indecision among traders. The relative strength index is nearly neutral at 51.83, indicating a balance between bullish and bearish forces. Trading within these levels calls for caution, with potential moves hinging on a decisive break above the mid-range resistance or a slide towards support. This environment offers opportunities for both scalping short-term dips and waiting for a clear trend before committing larger positions. Conclusion Monday could see fresh growth for SOL , ADA , and XRP . Despite the recent selloff, these coins have a strong potential for a rebound. The market trends suggest renewed interest and possible upward movement. Watch for increased trading activity and positive market sentiment. This could lead to new highs and overall optimism. Investors remain attentive to these coins' performance. Positive signs point to a potentially stronger start to the week. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-02 19:00:14,49435737,1754161214,Satoshimeter Shows Where Bitcoin Price Is In This Cycle,"The Bitcoin price surge above $120,000 has reignited speculation about where the flagship cryptocurrency stands in the current cycle. While price action alone offers only part of the picture, on-chain data from the Satoshimeter indicator suggests that Bitcoin is still firmly in the mid-phase of its cycle, pointing to significant potential ahead in its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Price Still In Mid-Cycle Stage Bitcoin’s climb from $100,000 to a new ATH above $123,000 has brought fresh attention to on-chain metrics used to identify the cryptocurrency’s current stage in the present market cycle. Among them, the Satoshimeter, an indicator developed by crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizard, offers a nuanced look into Bitcoin’s movements and price position. Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert According to the expert’s analysis released on X social media, the Satoshimeter signaled that Bitcoin is still far from the euphoric peak zones observed in previous bull markets. Stockmoney Lizard also claimed that Bitcoin’s rally is in its mid-cycle or intermediate phase rather than the final leg of the bull cycle. Supporting this analysis, the Satoshimeter employs on-chain metrics to map out Bitcoin’s cyclical behavior, identifying both long-term bottoms and tops. Historically, this indicator’s readings around 1.6 have typically marked major bear market bottoms, as seen in the price chart in the years 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2022. Higher values, on the other hand, previously aligned with cycle peaks and often signaled sharp corrections. As of now, the Satoshimeter is still well below the upper extremes, signaling that the Bitcoin price is not yet in the overheated zone. The analyst’s chart illustrates this trend clearly. Each past market top is marked by a steep spike in the indicator, aligning with parabolic price action and extreme sentiment. In contrast, current indicator readings are elevated but stable, sitting in the mid-range, well below levels seen at past cycle tops. This suggests that Bitcoin’s broader bullish structure remains intact, with potential for further upside on the table. Bitcoin To Reach $200,000 This Cycle? Based on the Satoshimeter’s current level, Stockmoney Lizards projects an extended run in the Bitcoin price. While the recent jump above $123,000 reflects growing momentum, the analyst anticipates a stair-step progression toward a potential high of $200,000 before a significant market correction sets in. Related Reading: Crypto Disaster: Qubetics Token Crashes Nearly 100%—Possible Rug Pull This projection is based not only on the readings from the Satoshimeter indicator but also on the movements seen in prior cycles, where BTC typically moved through multiple phases of accumulation, breakout, and parabolic growth. As of writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $113,759, reflecting an 8.3% decline from its all-time high. With $200,000 set as its next peak target, this implies a potential rally of more than 75% in the current cycle.

2025-08-02 19:00:10,49435759,1754161210,Josip Heit and Apertum win major lawsuit against Texas State Securities Board in landmark victory for DeFi,"The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) has formally dropped its case against the Apertum Foundation and its senior advisor, Josip Heit, a move that could shape the future of cryptocurrency litigation. Notably, the decision ends claims that Apertum’s DAO1 platform and APTM token were unregistered securities, while affirming they do not qualify as investment contracts under U.S. law. Represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, the Apertum Foundation successfully argued that its platform operates outside the scope of traditional securities regulations. Legal observers view the dismissal as a landmark moment, at a time when the regulatory landscape is increasingly open to blockchain technology driven by the policy shifts under the Donald Trump administration. Reaction to Apertum case dismissal Heit has consistently maintained that Apertum was both compliant and secure, framing the case as a test of regulatory boundaries. He therefore welcomed the dismissal as a validation of the platform and a step toward clearer legal frameworks for blockchain technology . “From Day One, the Apertum Foundation has offered a compliant, safe platform and cutting-edge technology. We promised to defend ourselves aggressively against the Texas Securities Board’s mistaken allegations, and we have now been vindicated. This dismissal confirms we did nothing wrong,” Heit said in a press statement shared with Finbold on August 2. On the other hand, Avi Perry, of Quinn Emanuel, said the case was unfounded, praised the firm’s legal effort, and acknowledged the TSSB for reversing its position. Apertum wins major lawsuit against Texas State Securities Board in landmark victory for DeFi With the legal development, the case not only removes uncertainty for Apertum but also sets a precedent for other DeFi platforms seeking clarity from U.S. authorities. Meanwhile, as the crypto industry continues to mature, the ruling may help define the contours of future regulatory oversight. This is specifically vital considering the United States is making progress toward a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Featured image via Flickr (public domain).

2025-08-02 19:00:00,49436846,1754161200,LTC may hit $300 while a next-gen payments altcoin shows 10x wallet growth in Q3,"Litecoin price is showing renewed bullish momentum, supported by strong institutional interest and promising technical setups, even as attention shifts toward next-gen altcoins powering the future of decentralized payments. With a 10x wallet growth and a game-changing beta launch on the horizon, analysts say this high growth crypto is emerging as the top crypto investment to watch in Q3 and will complement Litecoin in bringing accessible finance to underserved areas. Litecoin price eyes $300 amid whale accumulation LTC is trading around $105, consolidating above key support after bouncing from $100. Litecoin analysts now point to $120 as the next breakout level for Litecoin’s price, with bullish sentiment building toward the $300 target. Whale wallets added over 2 million LTC in July, signaling rising institutional confidence. The inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and key Fibonacci resistance at $132 could set the stage for a breakout rally. Litecoin’s appeal as “digital silver” continues to grow, especially as delays around ETF approval for top L1s shift focus to altcoins with proven liquidity and strong fundamentals. With faster speeds and lower fees than BTC, LTC remains a core institutional asset. Litecoin price predictions for late 2025 range from $199 to $280, with some analysts citing up to $670 if LTC momentum continues. Remittix: the PayFi altcoin exploding ahead of September launch While Litecoin benefits from institutional backing, Remittix (RTX) is stealing the spotlight as the top-performing early-stage crypto of 2025. Remittix has seen over 500 million tokens sold during its fundraising, achieving over 10x wallet growth ahead of its September 15 beta launch. Unlike Litecoin, which serves as a store of value, Remittix is solving real-world cross-border payment challenges, targeting the $190 trillion remittance market with direct crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries. Why Remittix is smart money’s next play Explosive wallet growth point to standout user adoption. Beta Launch Confirmed: Set for September 15, with crypto-ready APIs. Built for Business: Offers enterprise-grade tools for crypto payments with real-time fiat settlements. Security First: CertiK-audited with zero critical issues, cementing investor trust. Deflationary Model: Every transaction reduces supply, boosting long-term value. The top ICO’s multi-chain architecture, support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat pairs, and CertiK-audited security make it one of the most utility-driven tokens in the market. $250,000 giveaway powers massive user surge To build momentum ahead of its beta, Remittix is giving away $250,000 to steadfast holders , fueling a 380% spike in wallet signups. With the Defi company ready to process over $300 million in cross-border volume daily, investors are seeing a rare chance to get in early. For asset managers, Litecoin price is eyeing a 3x climb to $300, through slow, steady gains while Remittix offers the kind of exponential growth that defines the next generation of top crypto investments.

2025-08-02 18:55:10,49435575,1754160910,Crypto Futures Liquidation: The Shockwave That Wiped Out $601 Million,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: The Shockwave That Wiped Out $601 Million The world of cryptocurrency is known for its rapid movements and significant volatility. Recently, the market experienced a stark reminder of this reality when a staggering sum of money was wiped out in a short period. In just one hour, major exchanges witnessed $116 million worth of futures contracts liquidated, a figure that escalated to $601 million over a 24-hour span. These numbers, while startling, are not just statistics; they represent real financial impacts on traders and signal crucial insights into market dynamics. Understanding what drives such massive instances of crypto futures liquidation is essential for anyone navigating this complex landscape. What Exactly Is Crypto Futures Liquidation? To grasp the gravity of recent events, it is important to understand what crypto futures liquidation entails. In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin—the collateral they put up to open the position—falls below a certain threshold required to keep the trade open. When market prices move significantly against a leveraged position, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for the trader and itself. Leverage: This is the core concept behind futures trading. It allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, 10x leverage means you can trade with $10,000 worth of crypto by only putting up $1,000 of your own money. Margin: The actual capital a trader commits to open and maintain a leveraged position. It acts as collateral. Margin Call: While less common in automated crypto futures, conceptually, this is a warning that your margin is running low. Liquidation often happens automatically once the margin falls below the maintenance level. Maintenance Margin: The minimum amount of equity required in a trading account to hold a futures position. If the equity drops below this level, liquidation is triggered. Why Do Such Large Crypto Futures Liquidations Occur? The recent liquidation event, particularly the $116 million in an hour, is a direct consequence of several interconnected factors inherent to the crypto market. Understanding these drivers is key to anticipating and managing risk. Here are the primary reasons behind these significant liquidation cascades: High Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Sudden, sharp price movements, whether up or down, can quickly push leveraged positions into unprofitable territory. A large, unexpected price swing can wipe out the margin of numerous traders simultaneously. Excessive Leverage: Many traders in the crypto futures market use very high leverage, sometimes up to 100x or even higher. While this amplifies potential gains, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Even a small price movement against a highly leveraged position can lead to a total loss of the margin. Stop-Loss Hunting and Cascading Effects: Large market players or ‘whales’ can sometimes intentionally or unintentionally trigger a cascade. When a significant price move begins, it can trigger the stop-loss orders of many traders. As these positions are closed, it adds selling (or buying) pressure, further moving the price, which then triggers more stop-losses and liquidations, creating a domino effect. This phenomenon is often referred to as a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘liquidation spiral’. Market News and Events: Macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, or even major project updates can cause swift market reactions. If such news is negative and unexpected, it can lead to rapid sell-offs and, consequently, mass liquidations for long positions. A Closer Look at the $116 Million Crypto Futures Liquidation The reported $116 million worth of futures liquidated in a single hour and the broader $601 million over 24 hours highlight the intensity of recent market movements. These figures represent the total value of the positions that were forcibly closed. When such large amounts are liquidated, it suggests a sudden, significant price change that caught many leveraged traders off guard. Consider the scale of these events: Timeframe Approximate Liquidation Amount Implied Market Impact Past Hour $116 Million Sudden, Sharp Price Movement Past 24 Hours $601 Million Sustained Volatility & Pressure These numbers indicate that a substantial number of traders, likely those with high leverage, found their positions underwater very quickly. This often happens during unexpected market reversals or accelerated trends, where the market does not provide enough time for manual intervention or for lower-leveraged positions to withstand the pressure. Who Is Most Vulnerable to Crypto Futures Liquidation? While anyone trading with leverage faces the risk of liquidation, certain groups tend to be more susceptible. Retail traders, often drawn by the promise of amplified gains, sometimes overleverage their positions without fully understanding the risks. They might not have the sophisticated risk management tools or deep capital reserves that institutional traders possess. However, even institutional players can face liquidations if their risk models fail to account for extreme market conditions or ‘black swan’ events. The sheer volume of recent liquidations suggests that a broad spectrum of traders, from individual speculators to larger funds, felt the impact of the market’s recent movements. What Is the Broader Market Impact of Mass Liquidations? Large-scale crypto futures liquidation events do not happen in a vacuum; they send ripples throughout the entire crypto ecosystem. Their impact can be felt in several ways: Increased Volatility: As positions are closed, it can create further selling or buying pressure, exacerbating price swings. This can lead to a cycle where more liquidations occur, fueling further volatility. Market Sentiment: Significant liquidation events can dent investor confidence. Seeing large sums wiped out can lead to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), causing some traders to reduce their exposure or exit the market altogether. Funding Rates: Futures contracts often have ‘funding rates’ that traders pay or receive to keep their positions open. During periods of extreme liquidations, these funding rates can become highly skewed, indicating strong directional bias in the market. Exchange Stability: While exchanges are designed to handle liquidations, extremely rapid and large-scale events can test their systems. Robust liquidation engines are crucial for maintaining market order. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Traders Given the inherent risks, how can traders better navigate the treacherous waters of crypto futures trading and mitigate the risk of crypto futures liquidation? Here are some actionable insights: Understand Leverage Thoroughly: Do not use leverage blindly. Calculate the exact liquidation price for your position at different leverage levels. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required for liquidation. Implement Strict Risk Management: Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predetermined point. This limits potential losses. Position Sizing: Never allocate a large percentage of your portfolio to a single highly leveraged trade. Determine a comfortable percentage of your total capital you are willing to risk on any single trade. Diversify: While futures trading often focuses on one asset, consider your overall portfolio. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Monitor Funding Rates and Open Interest: These metrics can provide clues about market sentiment and potential areas of congestion where liquidations might occur. High open interest in a specific direction with extreme funding rates can signal a crowded trade vulnerable to reversal. Stay Informed and Adapt: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data. The crypto market evolves quickly, and adapting your strategy based on current conditions is vital. Start Small: If you are new to futures trading, begin with very small positions and low leverage. Gain experience and confidence before increasing your exposure. Challenges and Risks Associated with Futures Trading While futures trading offers the potential for significant profits due to leverage, it comes with substantial challenges and risks. The primary challenge is managing the amplified risk. A small miscalculation or an unexpected market move can lead to rapid and complete loss of capital. The emotional toll of trading, especially during volatile periods, can also be immense, leading to impulsive decisions that further exacerbate losses. Furthermore, the 24/7 nature of crypto markets means constant vigilance is often required, which can be mentally exhausting. The complexity of understanding various order types, margin requirements, and funding rates also presents a barrier to entry for many new traders. The Future of Crypto Futures Liquidation As the crypto market matures, exchanges are continually refining their liquidation engines and risk management protocols. However, as long as leverage exists, so will the risk of crypto futures liquidation. Regulatory oversight may also play a role in shaping how futures products are offered and used, potentially leading to stricter leverage limits in some jurisdictions. Ultimately, education and responsible trading practices will remain the most powerful tools for individual traders to navigate these inherent market forces. In conclusion, the recent $116 million in an hour and $601 million in 24 hours of crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and amplified risks within leveraged cryptocurrency trading. These events are not random occurrences but are driven by high leverage, sudden price movements, and cascading effects. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, understanding the mechanics of liquidation and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount. For traders, the key lies in informed decision-making, disciplined execution, and a healthy respect for the market’s unpredictable nature. Staying educated and practicing caution will be your best allies in this dynamic financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto futures liquidation? A1: Crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens when the market price moves against the trader’s position to such an extent that their margin (collateral) falls below the required maintenance level, preventing further losses. Q2: Why did $116 million worth of futures get liquidated in just one hour? A2: This large-scale crypto futures liquidation was likely triggered by a sudden and significant price movement in the cryptocurrency market. Traders with highly leveraged positions, particularly those without sufficient margin or proper stop-loss orders, were caught off guard, leading to a cascade of forced closures. Q3: How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidation? A3: Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, properly sizing their positions relative to their total capital, diversifying their investments, and continuously educating themselves on market dynamics and risk management principles. Q4: Does crypto futures liquidation affect the broader cryptocurrency market? A4: Yes, large liquidation events can significantly impact the broader market. They often lead to increased price volatility, can negatively affect market sentiment, and may influence funding rates, creating a ripple effect across the ecosystem. Q5: Is crypto futures trading inherently risky? A5: Yes, crypto futures trading is inherently risky due to the use of leverage, which amplifies both potential gains and losses. The high volatility of cryptocurrency markets further magnifies these risks, making it unsuitable for inexperienced traders or those with a low-risk tolerance.

2025-08-02 18:50:00,49435609,1754160600,"Trader Spots New Cheap XRP Alternative That Could Be Next to Deliver $100,000 from Just $1,000","Ripple (XRP) holders who rode the early wave from cents to dollars made life-changing gains. In its last major rally, XRP surged more than 13x in five years, turning modest investments into fortunes. With XRP showing signs of recovery but already a top-3 token, traders are looking for the next high-upside opportunity. One crypto analyst may have just found it, and it’s still under $0.002. That token is Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , a meme coin-turned-ecosystem project catching serious attention for its unique angle and explosive potential. Why Traders Are Comparing Little Pepe (LILPEPE) to Early XRP XRP delivered massive returns because it solved a real problem, cross-border transactions, and had institutional ambition. Though lighter in tone, Little Pepe is carving out a similar disruptive lane: a Layer-2 blockchain built just for memes, complete with lightning speed, ultra-low fees, and anti-sniper bot technology. Here’s what traders are zeroing in on: Massive upside at micro-cap entry: $LILPEPE is still in presale with a market cap well below $300 million. Layer-2 innovation: First meme-centric Ethereum-compatible chain with faster speeds and dirt-cheap transactions. Anti-sniper tech: A chain where bots can’t exploit early buyers, a first in crypto, and a huge selling point. Launchpad for future meme coins: Just as XRP provided rails for fintech, Little Pepe offers rails for the meme economy. Backed by meme experts who helped steer other viral coins to success. With over $13 million raised and 9.3 billion tokens sold, the project is already drawing deep liquidity and attention before launch, much like early XRP. Presale Momentum Soars as Price Up 70% From Start Little Pepe’s presale has been moving at a blistering pace. Since launching on June 10, it has sold out seven stages and is 91% through Stage 8, with tokens currently priced at $0.0017. That’s a 70% increase from the original price of $0.001 in Stage 1. Once Stage 9 goes live, the price is expected to rise again. The presale ends at a listing price of $0.003, meaning investors getting in now are still early, but not for long. The project has also completed its smart contract audit, boosting credibility among serious traders and increasing confidence that this isn’t another rug pull. Combined with a live CoinMarketCap listing , Little Pepe is already visible and verifiable, something few meme projects can claim before launch. Could $1,000 Turn Into $100,000? Let’s talk numbers. If LILPEPE pulls an XRP-like surge, similar to a 100x or 500x rally, which XRP did in past cycles, here’s what that looks like: $1,000 at $0.0017 becomes: $100,000 at $0.17 (approx. 59x) $170,000 at $0.29 (100x) $510,000 at $0.51 (300x+) That may sound bold, but consider the catalysts: Listings on 2 Top CEXs at launch A roadmap targeting the biggest exchange in the world Ongoing $777,000 giveaway to fuel presale interest and community engagement Built-in utility from Launchpad, L2 ecosystem, anti-bot architecture A strong vesting schedule to prevent dumping and maintain price stability ( view vesting ) In today’s meme economy, going viral isn’t just about memes but mechanisms. And Little Pepe seems to have both. How to Buy Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Buying LILPEPE early gives you access to the lowest price point before launch. Here’s how to get started: Visit the official presale site: littlepepe.com Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet recommended). Buy using ETH, USDT, or BNB. Track your holdings via the dashboard. Once the token launches, you can claim your LILPEPE directly from the same dashboard. Bonus: All presale buyers are automatically enrolled in the $777K giveaway , where 10 winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. Final Thoughts: Could This Be the Next Ripple Moment? XRP showed what can happen when utility meets timing and belief. Today, Little Pepe is shaping to be more than a meme, a movement built on early access, community innovation, and fresh tech. With the macro setup favoring altcoins, the meme narrative alive, and Trump’s rate cut talk pushing traders toward higher-risk, higher-reward bets, LILPEPE may be the token that turns $1,000 into life-changing returns. Presale is nearly over. Track or buy at littlepepe.com before Stage 8 closes.

In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says that the current market cap of Microsoft (MSFT) will soar by more than $1.1 trillion by the end of next year, after the company’s latest earnings came in this week. “We think Microsoft’s going to be a $5 trillion market cap in 2026 … when I look at what [Microsoft CEO Satya] Nadella is doing in terms of the cloud strategy, those are [cloud computing platform] Azure numbers that were beyond bull case… When you think about the big tech growth story in the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution, this is just the next phase of growth that’s now going to the second, third, fourth derivative.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.896 trillion and is trading for $524 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.23 trillion. Next up, Ives warns that while Apple’s earnings this week showed promise, the company is falling behind when it comes to AI. “Right now, [Apple’s] essentially on a park bench drinking lemonade, watching the AI revolution go forward… It was a robust quarter. I mean, you look at the demand bounce back that we saw in China, 4% growth… But the elephant in the room is AI… Investors want to see them now change the status quo.” Meanwhile, Ives believes Amazon’s profits will continue to increase. “If you look at AWS (Amazon Web Services), strong. You look at ultimately guidance, I mean guidance from a top-line perspective, I believe it’s pretty robust. I actually believe this is sort of the renaissance of growth that’s about to happen at Amazon.” Apple has a market cap of $3.02 trillion and is trading for $202 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading for $214 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $2.28 trillion.

According to Lee, this step could herald a new era for Ethereum (ETH). Tom Lee noted that Ethereum has been performing strongly against Bitcoin since April, with the ETH/BTC ratio steadily rising. He argued that Wall Street's interest in Ethereum is behind this move. According to Lee, the development of stablecoins on Ethereum has become a “ChatGPT moment” for the blockchain. Lee stated that the “Project Crypto” initiative, jointly announced by the SEC and the White House, aims to solidify the US's global leadership by moving financial markets onto the chain. “This means stepping into the golden age of finance,” Lee said, noting that Ethereum is the blockchain with the largest smart contract infrastructure. Related News: Company Known as Ethereum's MicroStrategy Purchased Another Large Amount of ETH Today Also Ethereum: It is the largest smart contract network and the most compliant with US regulations, It has never experienced an interruption since its establishment, JPMorgan said that giants like Robinhood prefer ETH in their tokenization processes. In the short term, Lee expects the ETH/BTC ratio to return to last year's levels (around 0.0500). In this scenario, Ethereum's price could rise to $5,707 in an environment where Bitcoin is trading at $114,000. According to the Fundstrat digital asset team, ETH is predicted to reach a fair value of between $10,000 and $20,000 in the next 12 months. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s why,"In response to Jim Cramer’s latest remark: “I always despise both August and September… just tough months to make money”, crypto influencer Amelie fired back with conviction: “WE ARE SO BACK — AUGUST & SEPTEMBER WILL BE BULLISH AF FOR XRP HOLDERS.” Her post, which quickly gained traction, is more than just hype. It reflects a growing belief among analysts and investors that XRP is poised for a major rally over the coming weeks. Cramer’s Comment Spurs Contrarian Optimism Cramer’s comment, while seemingly negative, is being interpreted as a classic contrarian indicator. Traders have long joked that doing the opposite of his public calls often yields better results. In that light, Amelie’s excitement suggests the market could be setting up for a breakout, especially for XRP. WE ARE SO BACK AUGUST & SEPTEMBER WILL BE BULLISH AF FOR #XRP HOLDERS pic.twitter.com/NA1YJznwvz — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) August 2, 2025 XRP Technical Outlook: Signs of a Breakout After peaking at $3.66 on July 18, XRP saw a pullback to around $2.89 by late July. This 16% correction appeared to signal weakness, but under the surface, analysts noticed bullish divergence—a signal that sellers are losing steam and a reversal may be forming. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.85. Analysts point to the $3.03–$3.10 range as a critical resistance zone. A strong daily close above this level could trigger a breakout toward $3.50 and beyond. Some projections suggest a surge to $4.00 or even $5.00 could be achieved in the short term if momentum holds. Bullish Forecasts from Analysts Crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino recently predicted a 333% surge in XRP’s price, potentially pushing it to $13 within 40 days. His projection is based on a classic Elliott Wave triangle breakout, supported by long-term accumulation and reduced volatility. Peter Brandt, another respected voice in technical analysis, sees potential for a 60% rally, targeting $4.47. Meanwhile, Bitget’s research team forecasts XRP hitting $5 by year-end, citing institutional adoption and expanding real-world use cases in cross-border payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other outlets, including Analytics Insight and Finance Magnates, anticipate that XRP could reach between $8 and $9 by mid-September under sustained bullish conditions and favorable macro factors such as ETF momentum or regulatory clarity. Institutional Accumulation Adds Fuel Recent on-chain data shows over 82 million XRP, worth approximately $246 million, moved off exchanges into cold storage. This pattern typically signals accumulation by large holders, reinforcing the bullish case. Combined with declining selling pressure and rising trading volumes, market structure appears to favor upside movement. Why Amelie Might Be Right Amelie’s bold declaration isn’t just a gut feeling. It’s supported by a convergence of strong technical signals, optimistic price forecasts, institutional accumulation, and favorable macro conditions. In a market where sentiment often leads price, her timing could prove prophetic. If XRP decisively clears the $3.25 to $3.50 resistance in the coming days, a strong rally toward $4 or $5 in August looks increasingly likely, with potential to reach $9 or higher by mid-September in a breakout scenario. For XRP holders, this might just be the comeback season Amelie predicted. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-08-02 18:30:17,49436177,1754159417,"Coinbase Delists Function X, Lists New Tokens Amid Service Expansion","Coinbase, the first crypto firm to join the S&P 500 index, recently announced that it will suspend trading for Function X (FX) on August 15, 2025. Coinbase made this decision after a routine review process. This move is part of the exchange’s strategy to ensure all listed assets continue to meet its strict listing standards. Coinbase Drops FX, Adds New Tokens The leading crypto exchange, with an over $100 billion market cap , found that the Function X project team had paused the smart contract linked to the token. This came after the team recently migrated the original FX ERC-20 token to a new one called Pundi AI (PUNDIAI). As a result of this change, the old FX token no longer meets Coinbase’s listing standards. As of now, FX order books on Coinbase have been moved to limit-only mode. This means users can still place or cancel limit orders, and matches can happen. However, no new market orders are accepted. FX trading will be suspended across all Coinbase platforms, including Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. While removing FX, Coinbase is also adding new assets to its platform. As announced, Bio Protocol (BIO), BankrCoin (BNKR), and Treehouse (TREE) are now available for buying, selling, converting, sending, receiving, and storing. These tokens can be accessed through the Coinbase website and mobile apps on iOS and Android. Coinbase Partners With JP Morgan and Samsung This move comes as Coinbase is expanding its reach through new partnerships. In July, the company announced a partnership with JP Morgan Chase , one of the largest U.S. banks. This will allow its users to connect their Chase bank accounts directly. Also, users can now even use their Chase credit cards to earn and redeem crypto rewards. In addition, Coinbase has started rolling out Samsung Pay as a payment method for buying crypto. The feature is now available in the U.S. and Canada, making it easier for users to add money to their accounts. At the same time, the company continues to show strong confidence in Bitcoin (BTC). As of June 30, the company added 2,509 BTC in the second quarter of 2025. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 11,776 BTC, bought at a total cost of $740 million. Big Progress for Crypto Regulation in the U.S. Coinbase’s recent progress comes after big news for the U.S. crypto industry. In July, the Trump administration signed the GENIUS Act into law , helping to set clearer rules for digital assets. Another bill, called CLARITY, is also moving forward and now heads to the Senate. These new laws are expected to boost the crypto market and make investors feel more confident.

2025-08-02 18:30:00,49436845,1754159400,SHIB eyes 100% gains but analysts warn of a new generation memecoin breakout,"The Shiba Inu price prediction buzz is growing after a tough week, with traders watching for a fast rebound. At the same time, Remittix is earning real attention after raising over $17.9 million by selling 578 million tokens at $0.0895 each. Many see the Remittix DeFi project as a practical rival while some analysts hint that a fresh memecoin wave could arrive soon. Shiba Inu price prediction: cup and handle signals and key lines to beat Source: Joe Swanson On the daily chart, a classic cup and handle setup supports a constructive Shiba Inu price prediction if buyers defend recent lows. Despite the pullback, Shiba Inu held key support twice, which backs a patient Shiba Inu price prediction for a climb into August. If momentum returns, the Shiba Inu price prediction points to recoveries toward prior July highs, while a loss of support would delay the move. Analysts who track Shiba Inu also note double bottom hints and improving volume on green days, adding fuel to a cautious Shiba Inu price prediction. If price clears near term resistance with a strong daily close, the Shiba Inu price prediction for a 100 percent swing improves, though Shiba Inu must keep volume rising to confirm the break. With wider markets still shaky after the FOMC ripple effect, Shiba Inu needs clean closes to stay on track. Remittix (RTX): why traders see a utility play in a memecoin season Remittix aims to make cross border payouts simple with low gas fee crypto, Crypto staking, and a cross-chain DeFi project design for workers, freelancers, and businesses.

2025-08-02 18:30:00,49434721,1754159400,Could This Be the Next $10 Coin? Investors Compare It to Chainlink (LINK) in Its First Year,"When Chainlink (LINK) first entered the crypto scene, it did so without hype or flash—but with a strong mission and a clear roadmap. Back then, most overlooked it as just another altcoin. Yet those who recognized its fundamentals and got in early saw massive returns, as LINK cemented itself as a key infrastructure player in decentralized finance. Today, the crypto world may be witnessing the beginning of another similar trajectory. A new project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads for all the right reasons and gaining serious attention for echoing LINK’s early momentum—except this time, with even more utility baked in from the start. Institutional-Level Infrastructure and Token Utility Already in Place Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale, but already giving off strong signals of long-term strength. The protocol is building a decentralized, non-custodial lending platform with both P2P and P2C models. Through the P2C model, lenders deposit stablecoins or blue-chip tokens like ETH, BTC, or USDT into smart contract pools and receive mtTokens, which not only represent their share of the pool but also grow in value as interest accrues. Borrowers, on the other hand, will be able to access overcollateralized loans using those same high-quality tokens as collateral—offering capital efficiency without needing to sell their holdings. Rates are governed by pool utilization, ensuring sustainable returns for lenders. The P2P system is designed for more flexible term-based deals, appealing to users seeking higher returns or bespoke agreements. But beyond lending mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is weaving in advanced tokenomics that many now consider the gold standard. One such feature is mtToken staking. Users who stake their mtTokens in designated smart contracts will earn MUTM as rewards—sourced directly from protocol revenue. Unlike inflationary models, the MUTM used for staking rewards will be bought back from the open market, creating continuous demand. In addition, the platform is preparing to launch its own decentralized stablecoin at listing. This stablecoin will be overcollateralized and minted only when a loan is issued, ensuring a controlled supply and maintaining a firm $1 peg. Borrowers will unlock it only by locking blue-chip assets, and it will be burned upon loan repayment—eliminating inflation risk and aligning supply with real-time market activity. To ensure trust and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underwent a CertiK audit, earning an impressive Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. This level of scrutiny, combined with a $50,000 bug bounty in collaboration with CertiK, signals a clear commitment to security—something Chainlink also focused heavily on during its foundational years. Furthermore, the platform’s upcoming integration with Layer-2 networks will unlock faster transactions and drastically reduced gas fees, making it far more accessible and scalable than most competitors. Presale Traction Signals Early Institutional Confidence As of now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, with over 10% of its 170 million token allocation already sold. That means investors have already poured in substantial capital—bringing total raised to more than $13.90 million across 14,800+ holders. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, representing a 15% increase, so the current entry point may very well be the final chance to secure tokens before listing momentum kicks in. To amplify community growth, a $100,000 giveaway is ongoing, rewarding 10 winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. It’s one of the few presales combining serious tokenomics with aggressive community engagement—two ingredients that drove LINK’s viral early-stage success. Those who bought into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at Phase 1, when the price was $0.01, are already sitting on a 6x gain. With the token expected to list at $0.06, current Phase 6 participants are still getting a highly discounted entry price. And with price targets from analysts suggesting $1.50 and beyond post-launch, early investors stand to capture over 30x upside from their entry. That kind of return places MUTM squarely in the same league as LINK’s historic rise during its first year of market exposure. The Road Ahead: A Four-Phase Plan Toward DeFi Dominance While the presale is building momentum, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is also methodically executing a clear four-phase roadmap. Phase 1 (Initiating) focused on launching the presale, completing the CertiK audit, and laying the foundation for listings and infrastructure. Phase 2 (Building) centers on development of the lending protocol, smart contract integrations, and Layer-2 support. Phase 3 (Finalizing) will include refining risk management, launching the stablecoin mechanism, and preparing liquidity pools. Phase 4 (Delivering) will see the full public beta rollout, protocol expansion, and long-term staking and reward modules. This isn’t a meme coin trying to ride hype—it’s a purpose-built financial protocol backed by robust technology and transparent execution. As Chainlink (LINK) has shown, true value comes from solving real problems and offering tools DeFi actually needs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following a similar playbook—only this time, with even more reward potential locked in at these early stages.

2025-08-02 18:24:59,49434276,1754159099,XRP Proponent Laments: So Ripple CEO Sold $200 Million of XRP at the Top,"A wave of frustration has swept through the XRP community following revelations that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold approximately $200 million worth of XRP near the recent market peak. The information, first flagged by blockchain analytics platform Xaif, was amplified in a post by prominent crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord, who questioned Garlinghouse’s faith in XRP’s long-term promise if he chose to offload such a substantial amount at the top. XRP sales linked to Garlinghouse’s wallets were reportedly spread over 10 days, sparking interest due to their large size and suspicious timing, which coincided with XRP’s local price peak. On-chain data from platforms like Lookonchain and confirmations from Xaif point to a deliberate and strategic liquidation that has unsettled parts of the XRP holder base. So Brad Garlinghouse sold $200m of $XRP at the top If it’s the future of finance why would he do that? This shit is starting to feel like a scam. The white house didn’t even mention it. I can feel a CTO coming on — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) August 1, 2025 Context: Past and Present XRP Sales This isn’t the first time Garlinghouse’s XRP holdings have raised eyebrows. In its 2020 lawsuit, the SEC disclosed that Garlinghouse sold approximately $600 million worth of XRP between 2017 and 2020, mainly on non-US exchanges. These earlier sales became central to the SEC’s claim that Ripple executives were profiting from unregistered securities offerings. With Ripple’s multi-year legal battle against the SEC nearing its end, some see the timing of this new $200 million sale as curious. In June 2025, Ripple Labs officially withdrew its cross-appeal against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following Judge Analisa Torres’ denial of the proposed final settlement agreement. The SEC is expected to follow suit, effectively closing one of the crypto industry’s most closely watched legal disputes. Community Reaction and Questions of Trust The backlash from the community has been swift. “If XRP is the future of finance, why would Brad sell now?” asked Crypto Bitlord. He also criticized the lack of government support, noting that the White House failed to mention XRP in its latest statements on digital asset innovation, further fueling fears that the project may be losing relevance on the national stage. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some users went as far as to call XRP a scam , citing these executive sell-offs as evidence that key figures are cashing out while everyday investors hold bags of hope. The sentiment was echoed by several influential voices on X, with one user stating, “It’s starting to feel like we’ve all been had.” Defending the Sale Supporters of Garlinghouse argue that executives are entitled to sell tokens for personal diversification, tax strategy, or liquidity, especially after years of navigating regulatory hostility. They also point out that Garlinghouse still holds significant XRP and Ripple equity, with his net worth estimated in the multi-billion-dollar range. Still, critics believe the optics are damaging. At a time when the XRP community is expecting utility breakthroughs and institutional adoption, a high-profile sale like this casts doubt on whether even Ripple’s leadership believes in the vision they’ve long championed.

2025-08-02 18:15:00,49435482,1754158500,"XRP to reach $10 by 2025, analysts say MUTM could follow with 30x returns","Could one of the best-performing cryptos of the decade soon be joined by a newcomer priced under 4 cents? While XRP sets its sights on a potential $10 rally by 2025, attention is turning toward another project that’s still in presale but showing early signs of outsized growth potential. With its current price at just $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being positioned by analysts as the next big cryptocurrency to watch. Ripple (XRP) price prediction: heading toward $10? XRP has been quietly climbing since early 2024, and recent forecasts suggest that the cryptocurrency could hit $10 by the end of 2025. That projection isn’t built on hype—it reflects a broader shift in institutional support, improving regulatory clarity, and the growing adoption of Ripple’s payment infrastructure. While volatility remains, analysts have pointed to the token’s recovery from sub-$1 levels to its recent position above $3 as a sign that momentum is real. Some forecasts even lean on technical patterns such as Elliott Wave theory and Fibonacci retracements to justify the $10 price point. Others cite major whale movements, rising trading volume, and Ripple’s expanding presence in global remittances. Regardless of the method, the takeaway is clear: XRP is no longer flying under the radar, and its current price action reflects a wider trend of accumulation across top cryptocurrencies. What is Mutuum Finance and why experts say it has 30x potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new decentralized protocol built around real DeFi utility. Its model is centered on lending and borrowing, with users able to participate through smart contract-based liquidity pools. What sets it apart, though, is that it supports both overcollateralized borrowing and passive lending through a dynamic dual-token system. Users receive mtTokens when depositing assets, which represent their share of the pool and automatically accrue value through interest. The protocol is preparing to launch a beta version of its platform shortly after token listing, a move that analysts believe will have a significant impact on its adoption. This post-launch milestone is expected to open the door for top-tier centralized exchange (CEX) listings, increasing exposure and buy pressure from new participants. With the launch price locked in at $0.06 and the presale still in Phase 6 at $0.035, the upside is already locked in for early buyers—around 100% gains at listing. Analysts who are tracking presale performance and token utility believe MUTM could climb as high as 30x, driven by rising demand, incoming product rollout, and the momentum that follows a successful launch on CEXs. When it hits that target, the token would be trading near $1.05, making it one of the most profitable tokens of the cycle. Why timing matters: entry at $0.035 could lead to massive gains With more than $13.8 million raised and over 14,700 holders, Mutuum Finance is one of the fastest-growing DeFi presales currently live. Phase 6 is already active, and as each phase sells out, the token price edges closer to its final listing value. For those entering now at $0.035, the difference is clear. A $2,000 investment at today’s price would yield approximately 58,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $1.05, that same position would be worth over $60,000. That’s the power of early entry in a well-structured cryptocurrency presale, especially when the fundamentals are strong and there’s a defined roadmap post-launch. Unlike many tokens that go live with no real ecosystem in place, Mutuum Finance has outlined clear next steps, including the beta platform release and multichain expansion. Additionally, the team is currently undergoing a CertiK smart contract audit, which adds another layer of trust. CertiK is one of the most respected blockchain auditing firms, and a successful audit not only boosts investor confidence but also serves as a positive signal for CEX listings. The protocol has also opened a security bug bounty, strengthening its infrastructure ahead of the platform’s public rollout. Could this be the best crypto to buy now? With XRP aiming for $10 and gaining traction in institutional circles, attention is shifting toward earlier-stage opportunities with similarly high upside. Mutuum Finance stands out among new crypto coins by offering a working product model, real token utility, and a built-in rewards mechanism through its buy-and-redistribute system, which sends a portion of revenue back to mtToken stakers. This creates an organic way to generate passive income for long-term holders. It’s rare to find a new DeFi crypto this early in development that’s also passed the $13M fundraising milestone and still offers entry under $0.04. Whether you’re looking for the next crypto to hit $1 or simply seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in before broader adoption, MUTM is gaining attention for all the right reasons. While XRP may dominate crypto news today with its $10 target, Mutuum Finance offers a different type of opportunity—one where entry now could turn a few thousand dollars into life-changing returns. Phase 6 is still live, but won’t be for long. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, this could be the window.

2025-08-02 18:01:08,49433270,1754157668,Inside GAIA’s Plan to Democratize AI With Open Infrastructure (Exclusive Interview),"GAIA has partnered with Samsung to launch a limited-edition AI-native phone, built on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Designed for AI sovereignty, the device enables users to run large language models directly on-device, eliminating cloud dependency while offering privacy, ownership, and rewards through its decentralized AI ecosystem. In this interview, Shashank Sripada, the project’s COO and Co-founder, explains how the GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 aims to make AI sovereignty tangible, offering users direct control over their data and digital assistants from the device itself. You describe GAIA as enabling “AI sovereignty.” In practical terms, what does that mean for the average user in regions where privacy concerns are high but technical literacy is low? AI sovereignty means control over your data, models, and the intelligence that acts on your behalf. For users in high-privacy regions with limited technical skill, GAIA offers turnkey domains and agent templates that let anyone deploy personal AI tools without ceding control to cloud platforms. Practically, this means: Your data stays local – inference can happen on-device or in a domain you control. You choose the agent – whether it’s open-source or fine-tuned to your context. No centralized surveillance – responses are composable, auditable, and censorship-resistant. Think of it like Signal meets ChatGPT – but powered by you, not a trillion-dollar cloud monopoly. Some argue that decentralized AI layers will simply recreate centralization under different labels if network participation is limited. How will GAIA avoid this pitfall? GAIA’s network economics, architecture, and governance are specifically designed to resist re-centralization: Open Node Access: Anyone can run a node – even on mobile or low-power edge devices – and stake to participate in inference. Deterministic Reward Distribution: Node rewards are tied to performance and decentralization, not centralized hosting or capital. Decentralized Domains & Agents: Value capture happens at the edge – meaning builders, not just validators or miners, accrue value. On-chain governance: Protocol upgrades and reward structures are governed by token holders, not a centralized foundation. In short, participation is low-barrier and structurally distributed. The economic incentives scale with decentralization, not against it. What regulatory or legal challenges do you anticipate GAIA facing with operating on-device AI inference and integrated wallets, especially with jurisdictions that have strict rules on AI and crypto? We’re proactively navigating this intersection of AI and crypto with a jurisdiction-aware architecture: On-device inference is akin to running local software or using open-source tools – not a regulated service on its own. Integrated wallets follow existing patterns from dApps and DeFi, but we ensure non-custodial design, user consent flows, and limited data exposure to stay clear of financial intermediation triggers. Jurisdictional fallback: Where required, GAIA can implement region-specific gating, disclosures, or compliance toggles, especially around KYC, model access, and token transfers. Partnerships with legal advisors in the US, EU, and Asia ensure we’re compliant with evolving AI transparency, explainability, and crypto rulesets. Regulation is inevitable – and GAIA’s modular structure makes it adaptable to emerging norms without compromising decentralization. How does GAIA plan to handle potential regulatory challenges around crypto rewards tied to hardware sales, especially in the US, where token incentives may trigger securities scrutiny? The GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 is designed to demonstrate what a fully decentralized AI interface looks like – one that is both sovereign by design and modular by implementation. From a regulatory perspective, GAIA avoids direct entanglements by ensuring that: The hardware functions as an open AI device, not as a financial instrument or token distribution tool. On-device inference is local-first and privacy-preserving – akin to using offline AI models or edge apps – not a hosted or custodial service. The integration of Web3 infrastructure (wallets, domain management, agent registries) follows non-custodial patterns, allowing users to interact with decentralized networks on their terms. Crucially, the GAIA Phone does not require any blockchain interaction to operate as a powerful AI assistant. This allows the phone to ship globally with optional features gated or localized based on regional legal norms – ensuring compliance without compromising on the broader vision. Rather than embedding financial assumptions into hardware, GAIA’s approach centers on empowering users to run private, autonomous AI agents locally – with full transparency, auditability, and freedom from centralized gatekeepers. Consumer education could be a major hurdle for Gaia’s adoption. Practically, how will you convince crypto users accustomed to wallets and DeFi to trust a decentralized AI phone, and what incentives or network effects will drive them to become node operators? The GAIA Edition Galaxy S25 is more than a phone – it’s a blueprint for how AI should work in a decentralized world. It delivers an experience that is immediately useful, deeply private, and intuitively extensible, even for non-technical users. Here’s how we’re solving the consumer onboarding challenge: Out-of-the-box utility The phone ships with pre-installed on-device AI agents that work from day one – including smart assistants, workspace copilots, and knowledge managers. Users experience low-latency, offline AI without needing to log in to cloud APIs – reducing friction and boosting trust. Seamless Web3 integration (without the learning curve) GAIA’s mobile stack includes a built-in wallet and agent registry, but is designed to be opt-in, non-custodial, and user-directed. Users can onboard into domains, deploy their own agents, or build automations via visual interfaces, not smart contract code. Real-world relevance and differentiation: Unlike typical phones that outsource intelligence to centralized servers, the GAIA phone empowers users to own their compute, their data, and their decision layer. This directly appeals to users in regions with strong data sovereignty values, privacy expectations, and distrust of platform monopolies. In effect, the GAIA phone makes decentralized AI tangible – not as an abstract concept, but as a daily tool that’s faster, safer, and smarter than the cloud. It’s our most powerful demonstration yet of how GAIA’s infrastructure can scale into the hands of millions – not through ideology, but through utility.

2025-08-02 18:00:49,49433629,1754157649,"Best Crypto Gambling Sites in 2025 Ranked, Spartans’ Position Might Surprise You","As crypto gambling sites in 2025 continue gaining momentum, users are no longer satisfied with flashy themes alone. They now expect faster speeds, transparent features, higher RTPs, and seamless play. Simply relying on brand hype is no longer enough. Platforms that prioritize real user satisfaction and fast payouts are now leading the pack. This breakdown ranks the five most talked-about crypto gambling sites this year, Stake.com, Roobet, BC.Game, BetMGM, and Spartans, based on essential usability factors like user interface, crypto compatibility, RTP reliability, and in-game flow. You’ll see how each one performs and why Spartans.com may be the most overlooked gem. 1. Spartans: The Sleekest & Fastest-Performing Crypto Gambling Site in 2025 Although Spartans .com is a relatively new entry among crypto gambling sites in 2025, it’s setting the bar in all the right ways. Built specifically for crypto users, the platform allows lightning-fast deposits and withdrawals in BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and AVAX, offering instant wallet connections and basic access without mandatory KYC. Its interface is sharp, combining simplicity with depth, making it easy to move between casino, sportsbook, and live games without confusion. Spartans stands out in RTP clarity and smooth gameplay. Every slot and live game runs without lag, even in mobile browsers. Its built-in betslip calculator and live stats tools give sports bettors an advantage, and the site’s crash and game show formats seem tailored for crypto-savvy users. Promotions include daily reload bonuses, clear giveaways, and even a Lamborghini prize, all with transparent rules. While Stake.com still leads in visibility, Spartans proves that fast and consistent performance is what keeps players returning. 2. Stake.com: Top Choice for Community & Global Brand Presence Stake.com remains a leader among crypto gambling sites in 2025, widely known for its global recognition, celebrity sponsorships, and loyal user base. Its desktop interface remains clean and user-friendly, and its betting slip system is still one of the best for combining multiple wagers. Stake excels in features that encourage community interaction, such as live chat and group betting, making it feel like a social platform. The platform supports quick crypto transactions and a broad list of tokens, including BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP. However, RTP reliability varies by provider, and it hasn’t fully embraced newer Web3 wallet integrations. For users who value brand recognition and community features, Stake.com is still a strong pick, though more performance-driven users might seek alternatives this year. 3. Roobet: Strong Game Variety but UI Design Needs Attention Roobet performs well in terms of licensing and game selection, offering thousands of titles from well-known providers. It supports BTC, ETH, and USDC for fast transactions and has added some limited smart contract withdrawal options. Performance is generally solid, and unique games like “Roobet Crash” remain popular with users. However, the platform’s interface can feel cluttered, especially on mobile devices. The design lacks the clarity seen in newer crypto gambling sites, and gameplay may lag during peak hours. While Roobet remains popular due to its long-term presence and loyalty perks, the interface could use a serious redesign to improve user experience. 4. BC.Game: Full of Features, but Not Ideal for Beginners BC.Game continues to rank among the top crypto gambling sites in 2025 when it comes to token support and DeFi tools. It accepts a huge range of cryptocurrencies and features its own utility token, which connects directly to bonuses and games. With options like mini-games, provably fair content, and shared jackpots, it has no shortage of variety for active players. The downside is that the platform can overwhelm newcomers. The homepage is packed with pop-ups, spinning bonus wheels, and constant chat windows, which can distract from actual gaming. Although it does well in RTP performance and crypto transaction speed, the noisy interface makes the experience less smooth. BC.Game works well for crypto veterans but may not suit players seeking simplicity. 5. BetMGM: Reliable Reputation, But Limited Crypto Support BetMGM, known for its roots in traditional betting, has cautiously entered the crypto gambling scene. The platform features one of the best-designed sportsbook layouts and polished casino interfaces. However, it only supports major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and withdrawals often take hours or require ID checks. RTP rates are dependable, and its partnerships with trusted providers like Evolution and NetEnt guarantee stable gameplay. Still, BetMGM trails behind in terms of wallet responsiveness and overall in-game flow. It’s a safe option for players who prefer established brands, but it lacks the agility crypto users have come to expect. Identifying the Best Crypto Gambling Site in 2025 There’s no shortage of crypto gambling sites in 2025 , but only a few truly meet the needs of today’s players. Stake.com still dominates in terms of brand and community features, while Roobet and BC.Game bring solid content and token variety. BetMGM delivers a familiar feel with traditional backing, yet falls short on crypto execution. Then there’s Spartans, the newcomer that avoids marketing fluff and delivers what really matters: fast gameplay, transparent features, and reliable crypto support. If you’re ready to upgrade from casual play to a rewarding and efficient crypto gambling experience, Spartans could be your smartest move this year.

2025-08-02 18:00:47,49434317,1754157647,‘Chokepoint 3.0’ Has Arrived? a16z Warns of Anti-Crypto Bank Tactics,"Big banks are making it harder and more expensive for consumers to use fintech and crypto apps, which amounts to what could be seen as ""Operation Chokepoint 3.0."" That’s according to Alex Rampell, General Partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). In its latest fintech newsletter , Rampell pointed to traditional financial institutions charging high fees to access account data or move money, particularly to services like Coinbase or Robinhood, as a move to strangle the competition. ""Under the Biden administration, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 tried to debank and deplatform crypto,"" Rampell said. ""That era has ended, but now the banks are aiming to implement their own Chokepoint 3.0 — charging insanely high fees to access data or move money to crypto and fintech apps — and, more concerningly, blocking crypto and fintech apps they don’t like,"" he added. Chokepoint 2.0 refers specifically to the debanking of crypto businesses and executives as a result of pressure exerted during President Joe Biden’s administration by regulatory authorities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). After Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, the Chokepoint 2.0 ended as regulators reversed many of the directives put in place during the previous administration. JPMorgan accusation JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest U.S. banks, was singled out as an example. Under current U.S. law, specifically Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, consumers have a right to access their own financial data. But banks are now asserting control over how that data is delivered electronically, sometimes charging fees for access to information as basic as routing and account numbers. A16z’s executive argued that such tactics could make transferring funds to alternative platforms more costly, deterring users and reducing competition. “If it suddenly costs $10 to move $100 into a crypto account,” Rampell wrote, “maybe fewer people will do it. And if JPM and others can block consumers from connecting their own freely chosen crypto and fintech apps to their bank accounts, they effectively eliminate competition.” Rampell’s words echo those of Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, who said JPMorgan charging fintech platforms for access to customer banking data will “bankrupt” them. “This is the kind of egregious regulatory capture that kills innovation, hurts the American consumer, and is bad for America.” Read more: Winklevoss Claims JPMorgan Halted Gemini Onboarding After Data Access Fees Criticism JPMorgan hasn’t address the platform directly, but did address the criticism. The bank told Forbes that nearly 2 billion monthly requests for user data come from third parties, and that by charging fees it aims to curb misuse. Rampell, meanwhile, is calling on the Trump administration to stop such practices by the banks before they become standard among the rest of the financial institutions. ""In a perfect world, consumers would vote with their wallets. But every bank will likely do this, and getting a new banking charter takes years. Many banks have hostages, not customers,"" Rampell said. ""We don’t need a new law; we just need the administration to prevent this callous and manipulative attempt to kill competition and consumer choice,"" he added.",Finance|JPMorgan|Andreessen horowit|Crypto|Fintech|Operation Chokepoint|News,EN,0,big bank making harder expensive consumer use fintech crypto apps amount could seen operation chokepoint according alex rampell general partner venture capital firm andreessen horowitz latest fintech newsletter rampell pointed traditional financial institution charging high fee access account data move money particularly service like coinbase robinhood move strangle competition biden administration operation chokepoint tried debank deplatform crypto rampell said era ended bank aiming implement chokepoint charging insanely high fee access data move money crypto fintech apps concerningly blocking crypto fintech apps like added chokepoint refers specifically debanking crypto business executive result pressure exerted president joe biden administration regulatory authority like federal deposit insurance corp fdic donald trump elected president chokepoint ended regulator reversed many directive put place previous administration jpmorgan accusation jpmorgan chase one largest bank singled example current law specifically section act consumer right access financial data bank asserting control data delivered electronically sometimes charging fee access information basic routing account number executive argued tactic could make transferring fund alternative platform costly deterring user reducing competition suddenly cost move crypto account rampell wrote maybe fewer people jpm others block consumer connecting freely chosen crypto fintech apps bank account effectively eliminate rampell word echo gemini tyler winklevoss said jpmorgan charging fintech platform access customer banking data bankrupt kind egregious regulatory capture kill innovation hurt american consumer bad read winklevoss claim jpmorgan halted gemini onboarding data access fee criticism jpmorgan address platform directly address criticism bank told forbes nearly billion monthly request user data come third party charging fee aim curb misuse rampell meanwhile calling trump administration stop practice bank become standard among rest financial institution perfect world consumer would vote wallet every bank likely getting new banking charter take year many bank hostage customer rampell said need new law need administration prevent callous manipulative attempt kill competition consumer choice added,0.124,0.789,0.087,-0.9282,0

2025-08-02 18:00:20,49433273,1754157620,3 Key Ethena (ENA) Support Levels To Monitor – Analyst,"Ethena (ENA) prices are presently in the red zone during a broader crypto market correction. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the DeFi token recorded a significant 2.00% loss in the past day, with prices presently set hovering around $0.55. Amidst this price decline, top market analyst Ali Martinez has identified the major support regions that investors should monitor in the event of any further price retracement. Related Reading: Ethereum Drops 6% After Hitting $3,800, But Analysts See New ATH Ahead Ethena CBD Shows Key Price Floors At $0.47, $0.44, And $0.35 According to Martinez, the cost basis distribution (CBD) model has revealed the three short-term relevant support zones in the ENA market. For context, the CBD model is an on-chain framework that visualizes the amount of tokens accumulated at various price levels. It is used to identify important price zones, i.e., potential support or resistance levels, based on their registered volumes of accumulation. In the chart above, it is observed that the more intense (warmer) the color, the higher the greater supply concentration of ENA at that level. Based on this system, it can be inferred that the immediate support levels for ENA currently lie around $0.44 and $0.47, where significant price clusters have been formed in the last month. However, if a compelling selling pressure forces the ENA price below this support zone, investors should anticipate the next price halt around $0.35. This price region is presently the strongest support in the Ethena market, as shown by the deepest red horizontal bar on the CBD model, which represents an estimated $1 billion ENA supply cluster. Notably, a price crash to the $0.35 support zone indicates a potential estimated 37.5% loss from current prices. Meanwhile, the CBD model also reveals that ENA’s next price resistance sits around the $0.60, at which lies the next immediate cluster above the spot price. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) DeFi TVL Rises Nearly 40% Following Octane Upgrade Ethena Price Outlook At the time of writing, ENA trades at $0.57, reflecting a 2.08% decline in the last 24 hours as earlier stated. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 2.05% indicating a slight rise in market engagement and transaction volume. According to CoinCodex, investor sentiment remains strongly bullish, with 67% of the past month’s trading days closing in the green. Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index sits at 65, reflecting a relatively strong appetite for risk among investors. However, Coincodex analysts hold a cautious market view with predictions of $0.46 and $0.45 in the next five and 30 days, respectively. Meanwhile, their long-term forecast project ENA to also trade around $0.46 in the next three months.

2025-08-02 18:00:09,49433226,1754157609,"SHIB Falls, SOL Slows, and Spartans Gains: Why the Crypto Market Is Shifting Toward Utility","While parts of the crypto market face hesitation, some tokens are creating concern rather than confidence. Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 7% after a 5-trillion token transfer from Coinbase, raising questions about a possible selloff or supply crunch. Solana touched $200 briefly but could not stay there, with weak signals pointing to a drop toward $185. Both tokens are raising doubts among holders. At the same time, Spartans.com is moving forward. With 5,963 games and crypto-only support for casino and sports betting, Spartans is emerging as one of the top crypto betting platforms. While SHIB and SOL face strong resistance, more users are turning to platforms that offer real value now instead of waiting for prices to recover. Spartans meets that demand directly. Large SHIB Transfer Creates Confusion in the Market A 5-trillion SHIB token transfer, worth close to $70 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet has left Shiba Inu watchers unsettled. The token dropped 7% and trades near $0.00001407, showing increased tension. Some see it as a bearish sign ahead of more selling. Others think it may lead to a supply squeeze if demand picks up. The technical data is mixed. SHIB faces resistance at $0.00001435, with room to rise to $0.000018 or even $0.000026 if momentum returns. The CMF and RSI show the token is still active. But a 36% fall in active SHIB addresses in two days suggests users are stepping back. While the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price reaction could move higher if shorts get cleared out, the large transfer has made the market uneasy. For now, SHIB’s short-term path depends on how major holders and regular users react to the shift. Solana Pullback Signals Market Uncertainty Solana’s latest move has created more doubt than strength. It briefly passed $200 but fell to $192.57, unable to hold its gain. Technical readings show ADX at 15.49, a sign of a weak trend. Supertrend and Parabolic SAR also point to a likely pullback to $185 or even $171.73. Still, it is not all negative. If Solana can regain strength and close above key resistance, a rally toward $242.57 is still possible. But for now, traders remain cautious about the Solana (SOL) price movement. Low strength and slowing momentum are blocking SOL’s climb at the moment. As that plays out, more users are turning to platforms that are based on usage, not just price action. Exploring Spartans: Where Utility Replaces Uncertainty In contrast to the ongoing price swings of crypto assets, Spartans.com offers clear value through direct use, fast performance, and steady activity. With 5,963 games including slots, blackjack, crash games, baccarat, roulette, and live game shows, it appeals to crypto users looking for more than market charts. There is no need for fiat or third-party steps. Everything runs on crypto for easy access. Spartans is now one of the leading crypto betting platforms and includes a full sportsbook for global events. Users can bet on football, basketball, UFC, tennis, and more, with real-time odds and live updates. Its betslip system is built for fast use, allowing players to go from watching to betting without delay. The site supports many cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, and ADA. Withdrawals are processed quickly without bank wait times. New users can claim a 300% bonus for casino and sports sections, while regular players benefit from a 25% daily deposit bonus. For those aiming higher, Spartans also runs a Lamborghini giveaway. Anyone can join by signing up, depositing, and taking part. That’s all it takes to enter. Spartans works on mobile without the need to install an app. It connects easily with wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet for smooth play anytime. In a market full of shifting trends and empty talk, Spartans offers one clear feature: using crypto for fun and rewards right away. Final Say With Shiba Inu (SHIB) showing signs of fear and Solana (SOL) unable to hold its gains, many in the crypto world are starting to look at value from a different angle. Projects with strong ideas are useful, but working products are even better. Spartans.com is already in that category, offering 5,963 games, fast crypto withdrawals, and a wide sportsbook that covers key global matches. It’s not just a promise for later. Spartans is working now and stands as one of the top crypto betting platforms. In a market like this, holding crypto is only part of the picture. Using it for real results matters too, and Spartans is one of the few platforms where that’s possible. It’s made for those who want returns now, without waiting for the next big rally to begin.

2025-08-02 18:00:00,49433944,1754157600,"Forget Cardano (ADA): Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) CoinMarketCap Debut Sparks One of the Fastest Current Presales, Analysts Predict 100x Before 2026","Cardano (ADA) has long been heralded as one of the most innovative cryptocurrencies in the blockchain space. But as its momentum slows, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is accelerating at breakneck speed, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts globally. Since its CoinMarketCap (CMC) debut , Ruvi AI has seen unprecedented presale success , with over 1 million tokens sold daily and 70% of Phase 2 completed in record time. With analysts forecasting a potential 100x return before 2026 , Ruvi AI is shaping up to be the must-watch token of the year. Combined with its innovative blend of blockchain and AI , audited security, and an upcoming 33% price increase , now is the time for investors to take notice. How CoinMarketCap Boosted Ruvi AI’s Success CoinMarketCap isn’t just a platform, it’s a seal of legitimacy in the crypto world. A listing on CMC brings immediate validation , global exposure, and credibility. For Ruvi AI, this milestone launch put the token on the map, propelling it into a frenzy of investor interest. Numbers Show Explosive Growth 1 Million Tokens Sold Daily: Demand for Ruvi AI is accelerating like no other presale in 2025. 70% of Phase 2 Completed: Over 210 million tokens have already been claimed. $2.6 Million Raised: A testament to Ruvi AI’s growing popularity among retail and institutional buyers alike. Phase 2 is ending soon, and the token price will rise from $0.015 to $0.020, a 33% increase. Investors sitting on the sidelines risk being priced out of one of the fastest-growing opportunities in crypto. Why Ruvi AI Outshines Cardano Cardano has built its reputation on scalability and long-term vision, but Ruvi AI offers something Cardano doesn’t , immediate utility and practical, AI-driven solutions. By combining real-world applications with blockchain architecture , Ruvi AI is primed for both rapid adoption and sustained growth. What Makes Ruvi AI Unique? 1. Cutting-Edge AI Integration Ruvi AI doesn’t rely solely on speculative value. Its platform delivers AI-powered tools that help businesses optimize marketing, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency. These solutions give Ruvi AI a distinct advantage, making it more than just a token. 2. Blockchain-Powered Payment Systems Ruvi AI solves one of the gig economy’s biggest frustrations, unreliable payments. Freelancers, influencers, and creators benefit from secure, instant, and transparent payment systems , which deliver trust and accuracy at scale. 3. Cross-Industry Versatility While Cardano focuses on blockchain advancements, Ruvi AI applies its technology across various sectors, including healthcare, education, finance, and entertainment. This adaptability ensures it caters to a broad range of users, giving it massive global appeal. VIP Bonuses Deliver Unbeatable ROI One of the key drivers behind Ruvi AI’s presale frenzy is its tiered VIP bonus system , which rewards early investors with unparalleled returns. VIP 2 ($750 Investment): Secures 50,000 tokens at $0.015 each plus a 40% bonus , adding 20,000 extra tokens for a total of 70,000 tokens. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, this investment turns into $70,000, a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 Investment): Provides 100,000 tokens plus a 60% bonus , adding another 60,000 tokens for a total of 160,000 tokens. At $1, this transforms into $160,000, a remarkable 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 Investment): Awards 500,000 tokens and doubles holdings with a 100% bonus (an additional 500,000 tokens) for a total of 1 million tokens. When valued at $1, this becomes an incredible $1 million, an awe-inspiring 13,233% ROI. Leaderboard Rewards Create Additional Incentives Ruvi AI’s leaderboard system adds extra perks, offering top contributors up to 500,000 bonus tokens . For major investors, these rewards make participation even more lucrative. Built on Trust and Security While many tokens rely on hype alone, Ruvi AI emphasizes trust and reliability, underpinned by a comprehensive CyberScope audit. CyberScope Audit Highlights Tamper-Proof Smart Contracts: Designed to safeguard investor funds against vulnerabilities or manipulation. Transparent Blockchain Framework: Every transaction can be traced, fostering accountability and trust. This commitment to security ensures that Ruvi AI is not only set for growth but grounded in safety, a key differentiator in today’s volatile market. Why Timing Is Critical With over 1 million tokens selling daily and Phase 2 coming to an end, the opportunity to buy Ruvi AI at $0.015 is quickly evaporating. The 33% price hike to $0.020 marks a turning point, solidifying its status as one of the fastest-growing presales in crypto history. Analysts predicting 100x returns before 2026 only add urgency to Ruvi AI’s momentum. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting out, this is the kind of early-stage opportunity that could change everything. Don’t settle for lagging projects. Instead, capitalize on Ruvi AI’s explosive rise and secure your stake in the next big thing before it’s too late. Act now and join the wave reshaping cryptocurrency’s future.

2025-08-02 07:52:25,49423641,1754121145,"Shiba Inu Team Says They’ve Always Believed in SHIB Reaching $0.01, But Everything Takes Time","Despite Shiba Inu’s continuous stay around the $0.00001 region, a top team member expresses belief that SHIB will eventually hit $0.01 someday. Recently, the broader crypto market has endured consistent downturns, keeping the price of major assets like SHIB at lower levels. The latest bloodbath happened toward the end of July, starting with the Fed’s refusal to slash interest rates. U.S. President Donald Trump mounted further pressure on financial markets, including crypto, after unveiling his administration’s latest reciprocal tariff plan. That announcement ushered in a major downturn, with SHIB’s price crashing to $0.00001179. Despite reclaiming $0.000012 shortly after the dip, SHIB remains far from reaching some ambitious targets, specifically the one-cent dream or $0.01 price. Team Believes SHIB Can Reach $0.01 This price forecast has sparked a significant debate within the community, with top enthusiasts deliberating on whether SHIB could attain the target. Interestingly, Lucie, the lead of marketing at Shiba Inu, has also joined the debate. The marketing lead emphasized that she has always had faith in Shiba Inu’s ultimate rally to the $0.01 target. This has been Lucie’s aspirational goal for SHIB since she became a holder in 2021. Despite believing in Shiba Inu’s capacity to rally towards $0.01, she cautioned that SHIB will not reach the target immediately. Lucie stressed that everything, including SHIB’s potential surge to $0.01, requires time to materialize. Lucie has been a firm believer in Shiba Inu, suggesting that the token will kick off the bull run. Her confidence stems from the team’s dedication to enhancing SHIB’s utility, which has led to the birth of several projects, such as Shibarium, ShibaSwap, non-fungible tokens, and P2E games like Shiba Eternity. The team is also intensifying efforts to reduce SHIB’s enormous supply of 589 trillion. This is evident in the team’s allocation of Shibarium gas fees to token burns. Given Lucie’s knowledge of the Shiba Inu ecosystem and the things happening behind the scenes, she believes the token could reach $0.01 in its lifetime. However, she cautioned that it may take time for this prediction to materialize. Debate About SHIB $0.01 Forecast Spike As mentioned earlier, deliberations about the possibility of $0.01 prediction coming to fruition have not cooled off, with the community divided into two separate views. One part features the likes of Lucie, Luis Delgado , and YourPOP , who believe $0.01 is a realistic target for SHIB. However, most commentators regard the $0.01 target as unattainable, given the extraordinary growth rate SHIB would need to achieve it. For context, from the current price of $0.00001201, Shiba Inu would require a rally of 83,163% to reach $0.01. This estimated price is equivalent to a market capitalization of $5.89 trillion, assuming Shiba Inu’s supply remains the same at 589 trillion tokens. Proponents of this theory believe that the only way SHIB can attain the $0.01 target is if it burns a massive chunk of its supply and the token attracts the attention of institutional investors. So far, no institutions have shown such interest, nor has any spot ETF been filed for the token.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,1,despite shiba inu continuous stay around region top team member express belief shib eventually hit someday recently broader crypto market endured consistent downturn keeping price major asset like shib lower level latest bloodbath happened toward end july starting fed refusal slash interest president donald trump mounted pressure financial market including crypto unveiling administration latest reciprocal tariff plan announcement ushered major downturn shib price crashing despite reclaiming shortly dip shib remains far reaching ambitious target specifically dream price team belief shib reach price forecast sparked significant debate within community top enthusiast deliberating whether shib could attain target interestingly lucie lead marketing shiba inu also joined debate marketing lead emphasized always faith shiba inu ultimate rally target lucie aspirational goal shib since became holder despite believing shiba inu capacity rally towards cautioned shib reach target immediately lucie stressed everything including shib potential surge requires time materialize lucie firm believer shiba inu suggesting token kick bull run confidence stem team dedication enhancing shib utility led birth several project shibarium shibaswap token game like shiba eternity team also intensifying effort reduce shib enormous supply trillion evident team allocation shibarium gas fee token burn given lucie knowledge shiba inu ecosystem thing happening behind scene belief token could reach lifetime however cautioned may take time prediction materialize debate shib forecast spike mentioned earlier deliberation possibility prediction coming fruition cooled community divided two separate view one part feature like lucie luis delgado yourpop believe realistic target shib however commentator regard target unattainable given extraordinary growth rate shib would need achieve context current price shiba inu would require rally reach estimated price equivalent market capitalization trillion assuming shiba inu supply remains trillion token proponent theory believe way shib attain target burn massive chunk supply token attracts attention institutional investor far institution shown interest spot etf filed token,0.026,0.794,0.18,0.9918,1

2025-08-02 07:33:56,49407046,1754120036,From $115K to $150K? The Bullish Case for Bitcoin’s Year-End Comeback,"As July closed out, Bitcoin suffered a notable pullback as it corrected to approximately $113K – a decline of several thousand dollars from mid-month highs north of $123K. Despite the setback, the market watchers remain bullish about the world’s largest crypto asset’s prospects for the year-end. $115K Now, $150K Soon? As Bitcoin mining enters the second half of 2025, the sector’s fundamentals remain strong, but the room for errors is shrinking. The analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash predicts that the crypto asset will trade between $130,000 and $150,000 by year-end, if the ETF inflows remain and the macroeconomic backdrop remains consistent. In a statement to CryptoPotato , TeraHash said that several factors are at play. The Federal Reserve’s expected rate cut in September, along with regulatory clarity from the SEC, CFTC, and the full implementation of Europe’s MiCA framework in Q4, are expected to play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment. “On-chain, hashrate is expected to reach ~1.2 ZH/s, with mining difficulty climbing toward 140T, driven by large-scale deployment of next-gen ASICs and geographic expansion into energy-advantaged regions such as Paraguay, Oman, and parts of Africa. But as costs rise and competition accelerates, miners without efficient hardware or access to low-cost energy will struggle to remain profitable.” At the same time, Hashrate-as-a-Service (HaaS) offerings are gaining traction among institutional investors, as they provide a lower-risk avenue to gain mining exposure. As the post-halving environment increasingly favors scale and strategic execution, the latter half of 2025 will test miners’ adaptability. “Bitcoin mining in late 2025 is about precision, adaptability, and staying ahead in a system that grows more competitive with every block.” Jaw-Dropping BTC Prediction While a certain cohort of investors has resorted to profit-taking, long-term bullish sentiment remains intact. For instance, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors came up with an even bolder prediction that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by year-end. Prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper also believes that the crypto asset could hit that milestone. Amid all the furor, financial giant Charles Schwab, as well as billionaire CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz, predict that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by the end of 2025.

The cryptocurrency market has taken an unexpected turn, and some market users are already selling. Hayes, who is a long-standing bull , joined the trend yesterday, data from Arkham shows.For context, wallet address “ 0x6cd6 ,” marked as Arthur Hayes by Arkham, moved Ethereum, Pepe, and Ethena to multiple trading platforms on August 1, potentially to sell them. This comes following a broader market dump, which saw Bitcoin and Ethereum fall 1.50% and 4.63% in the past 24 hours.Arthur Hayes Offloads His CryptosNotably, the selloffs started with Ethena, with the wallet moving 7.764 million ENA tokens to Binance Deposit on August 1 at precisely 20:03 (UTC). Notably, this is all his ENA holdings, worth $4.62 million at the time of the transfer.Two minutes later, he transferred 38.86 billion PEPE worth $415,470 to Cumberland DRW. Arthur then started converting his wrapped Ethereum (WETH) to Ethereum for sale.Arkham shows that he unwrapped 2,095 ETH ($7.86 million) over two transactions on the Uniswap V3 pool, receiving the 1:1 reciprocal in Ethereum. Following the conversion, he transferred them to centralized trading platforms.First, he moved 1,000 ETH ($3.5 million) to B2C2, a liquidity provider and trading platform based in London. He then offloaded 1,373 ETH ($4.82 million) to Binance Deposit, bringing the total to 2,373 ETH ($8.32 million). Notably, the offset came from his outstanding Ethereum stash, currently standing at 233,444 ETH ($824,390). Arthur Hayes Crypto Sales A Broader Market Ethereum Sell-OffMeanwhile, Lookonchain identified that besides Hayes, other whales are also selling Ethereum. The analytical platform shared that the wallet address “0x3c9E” has deposited 26,182 ETH ($93.66 million) to several exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Kraken, in the past 48 hours.Coinbase and Binance have also been depositing Ethereum to Wintermute. In the past 24 hours, they have moved thousands of Ether to the platform, potentially to use its OTC services to dump them with minimal market impact.Some Others Are Buying the DipNonetheless, some still see the Ethereum correction as an opportunity to buy cheap. For context, a new wallet, “0xdf0A,” received 16,496 ETH ($58.5 million) from the Galaxy Digital OTC address.Lookonchain pointed out that a total of 12 new wallets have bought 808,347 ETH ($2.85 billion) since July 9.Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming also bought the dip, spending another 108.57 million USDC to buy Ethereum.

2025-08-02 07:30:31,49407033,1754119831,Gemini AI Predicts XRP Price for the Next 5 Years,"Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming a tool of choice for forecasting crypto prices, and Gemini AI’s latest model has delivered a bold multi-year projection for XRP. The platform expects Ripple’s native token to outperform in the coming years, supported by institutional adoption and the rollout of tokenized financial infrastructure. Amid this surge in AI-driven interest, investors are also turning to earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which just posted its highest-ever level of weekly user interaction. The project’s momentum is fueling comparisons to the early days of many top projects – where small investments turned into life-changing gains . XRP Forecast by Year: AI Models Suggest Steady Growth Gemini AI outlines a bullish case for XRP through 2029. In the short term, the model sees XRP revisiting its previous all-time high of $3.84 as early as 2025, with upside linked to ETF speculation and cross-border settlement use cases. By 2026, the forecast estimates a climb to $6.20, driven by banking partnerships and broader regulatory clarity. If Ripple’s legal environment stabilizes, the path toward $9.30 by 2027 becomes increasingly likely. For 2028 and 2029, Gemini AI predicts XRP could break into double digits, reaching $12.75 and $15.60 respectively. These targets are tied to broader adoption of blockchain for government-backed digital currencies and improved global remittance rails. While XRP maintains its stronghold in the top crypto ranks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exploding with fresh investor momentum. This week marked its most active community participation yet, with analysts citing record-breaking growth in engagement and funding velocity. With rising demand and a finite presale allocation, early backers are eyeing returns that could rival 2021’s biggest altcoin success stories . Conclusion If Gemini AI’s model is right, XRP could see significant growth over the next five years—but the biggest winners may come from the projects just entering the spotlight now. With MAGACOIN FINANCE hitting historic engagement milestones, many investors are taking notice before the gates fully open.

2025-08-02 07:30:00,49407119,1754119800,2 Best Cryptos to Buy as DeFi Summer Catches Momentum,"As the DeFi summer narrative begins to heat up once again, investors are closely watching cryptos poised to ride the momentum of a revived decentralized finance ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ethereum (ETH) are capturing outsized attention. Mutuum Finance is at a price of $0.035 during phase 6 of presale. Those investing now are guaranteed a 71.43% ROI at launch. Mutuum Finance has already sold over $13.9 million and has more than 14,800 investors on board. Alongside Ethereum (ETH), Mutuum Finance is the top crypto to buy now. Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims $3,000 Amid DeFi Summer Momentum Ethereum is currently trading at $3,618. Technical signals like the breakout from a symmetrical triangle, rising open interest, and sustained ETF inflows suggest momentum is strengthening. Common 2025 price target is ranging from $4,000 to $6,000, and some bullish forecasts extend to $7,000–$8,000 if institutional demand continues to grow. In this rising DeFi environment, interest is also shifting toward emerging protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Accelerates Growth with Phase 6 Launch Mutuum Finance is performing well in presale, selling out the 5th round ahead of schedule. The project is now in round 6 valued at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is transforming the DeFi world by creating an extensible financial system with use cases in real life. The presale has gained more than 14,800 token owners and raised more than $13.9 million. $100K Worth of Tokens Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance has also launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be awarded a $10,000 prize in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is proof of how committed the project remains towards building a long-term and loyal fan base. CertiK-Backed Bug Bounty Boosts DeFi Security In another bid towards its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team will reward a maximum of $50,000 USDT to the participants who identify likely vulnerabilities in the project. The aim of the bounty program is to obtain a suitable coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is segmented into the four classes of severity; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the commitment of the team towards the security of ecosystem along with investors’ trust. Next-Gen Dual-Lending Solutions Mutuum Finance is among the top DeFi projects on which the users are in absolute control of their assets. The project applies a double-lending mechanism for provision of flexibility alongside the effectiveness which comprises Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract uses a self-executing smart contract that conducts the lending automatically with no human intervention, programmed to respond to the change in market prices based on a floating rate of interest according to what exists at the time of the demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the middlemen and has a possibility of being directly linked to lenders and borrowers. It is even more common in meme coins because it has a possibility of having specified terms of a loan and flexibility based on the risk-bearing willingness of a user. Ethereum (ETH) may be reclaiming momentum above $3,600, but it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s turning heads with its early-stage growth. Currently in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, MUTM offers a guaranteed 71.43% ROI at launch price $0.06. The next price jump to $0.04 is coming soon. So far, over $13.9 million has been raised, and more than 14,800 investors are already in. Backed by CertiK, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 token giveaway, Mutuum Finance is the top DeFi opportunity to watch this summer.

2025-08-02 07:27:37,49406867,1754119657,International Bar Association: Ripple (XRP) v. SEC Will Set a Precedent for Crypto Industry,"While regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. work to establish clearer digital asset legislation, the judiciary has taken on a more immediate role in determining how cryptocurrencies are treated under existing legal frameworks. The Ripple lawsuit , specifically its handling of XRP token sales, has become a pivotal moment in U.S. crypto law. In the recent publication by the International Bar Association (IBA), titled Digital Regulations in the Metaverse Era, the Ripple case is referenced as having significant potential to influence how courts draw boundaries in token-based transactions. The analysis focuses on how the court, under Judge Analisa Torres, made a distinction between “direct contractual efforts between issuers/promoters and purchasers” versus general “market purchasing in the token space.” This differentiation could become the basis for future case law affecting both developers and investors across the cryptocurrency landscape. The International Bar Association affirms that the outcome of Ripple v. SEC will set a precedent for the entire cryptocurrency industry. This is documented below. https://t.co/aHaf8WoiE2 pic.twitter.com/0ZqnVG8X8t — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 XRP and the Judicial Line Drawn At the core of the case was whether XRP constituted a security under U.S. law. The court found that Ripple’s sales of XRP on public exchanges did not violate existing securities laws , though it did rule against Ripple’s direct sales to institutional investors. This decision ultimately provided Ripple with a legal win that many in the industry had anticipated for years, and opened up the U.S. market for XRP adoption. While the lawsuit extended much longer than that ruling, the decision was pivotal and remains unchanged despite subsequent developments in the lawsuit. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications Beyond Ripple and XRP In the highlighted section, it notes that rulings “have the potential to create a precedent in the cryptocurrency industry.” This includes how courts might interpret relationships between promoters and token buyers moving forward. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) highlighted this development with an image from the IBA’s report, reinforcing the relevance of the precedent set by XRP. That judicial distinction could have a lasting influence on how new tokens are structured, marketed, and offered in secondary markets. Ripple fought for clarity for XRP, and now market participants can draw from this outcome when crafting token strategies that minimize legal exposure. The precedent doesn’t resolve all regulatory uncertainty, but it offers a functional distinction that may influence future enforcement actions. The cryptocurrency space is finally receiving proper regulation through the recently passed GENIUS Act , and additional bills are currently being considered by the U.S. government. XRP will always hold a unique role in setting an important precedent for crypto regulation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-08-02 07:26:01,49423637,1754119561,"Uphold’s XRP to $1,000 Comments Make Waves Again","The long-standing speculation about XRP reaching $1,000 has resurfaced as a community member revisited past posts by U.S.-based exchange Uphold. Earlier today, X user HchannelX brought attention back to Uphold's past tweets speculating on an XRP price of $1,000. While the posts, dating as far back as 2020, were intended as hypothetical prompts, they continue to stir excitement among XRP holders who view the scenario as a long-term possibility.One of the tweets from Uphold, originally posted in late 2021, asked, “What’s the first thing you’d do if XRP reached $1,000?” Although never meant as a price prediction, these posts have repeatedly gone viral, often interpreted by some community members as indirect bullish signals. Now, with XRP trading around $3, these old tweets are gaining new relevance.A $1,000 XRP Would Be MonumentalAt the current price of $3, XRP would need to rise by 33,233% to reach $1,000. Such an increase would turn a $1,000 investment today into more than $330,000, a dream scenario for many long-term holders.The hypothetical milestone would also give XRP a market capitalization of over $59 trillion based on its circulating supply today. For comparison, Bitcoin’s market cap is currently around $2.26 trillion, and the total crypto market stands just above $3.7 trillion.Despite the enormous leap required, the community’s appetite for big numbers remains strong.XRP Army Reaction to $1,000 Price OutlookResponding to Uphold’s original question about what holders would do if XRP reached $1,000 , XRP enthusiasts have shared various aspirational goals. Some joked about buying private islands, while others mentioned paying off debt, investing in businesses, or donating to charity.Yet, not everyone supports the lofty vision. Some community members urged caution, pointing out the implausibility of a $1,000 XRP under current global market conditions. At that valuation, XRP alone would surpass the GDP of most countries.However, industry leaders like EasyA founder Dom Kwok argue that it's not unrealistic for XRP’s valuation to reach the trillions or exceed the GDP of many nations. According to him, dismissing the $1,000 outlook based on current limitations may prove short-sighted in hindsight.Uphold Clarifies: No Official PredictionWhile many interpret Uphold’s XRP-to-$1,000 posts as price predictions, the exchange has consistently clarified that it does not issue official forecasts. Instead, it frames these posts as community engagement prompts, inviting users to imagine hypothetical future scenarios.However, the XRP Army, known for connecting dots, continues to speculate.

Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a technical analyst on X, recently shared this observation, highlighting the performance of both assets as they approach key resistance zones after completing similar breakout patterns. This has led many market watchers to assess whether these levels will hold or finally give way. The most important resistance level for #XRP and #XLM right now! pic.twitter.com/wBlrjhUoA8 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 31, 2025 Identical Patterns and Shared Resistance In the analysis presented by Steph, XRP and XLM are seen on the weekly timeframe following near-identical falling wedge patterns . These patterns are typically considered bullish once broken to the upside, and both assets have now done exactly that. The chart reveals that both assets broke above the upper trendline of the falling wedge in July. After this breakout, each asset’s momentum appears to have stalled near notable resistance levels. XRP has reached an all-time high of $3.65 , and this level has so far held firm, stalling further upward momentum. Similarly, XLM has faced resistance around $0.51, with this ceiling capping its performance in July and preventing it from reaching a new all-time high, including XRP. Steph Is Crypto described these levels as the most important resistance for both assets, and overcoming them could open the door to significant gains for both assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Technical Implications of Resistance The resistance zones on both charts show a clear barrier that has not yet been broken decisively. For XRP, a clean break and close above this zone on the weekly chart would be viewed by many technical analysts as a confirmation of continued bullish momentum. Other prominent analysts have predicted that breaching the $3.65 level could send XRP toward double-digits . Until such a move occurs, the price could remain trapped below this level, consolidating or even retracing. XLM faces a similar scenario, where the breakout could potentially send it to a new all-time high, breaking the record it set in 2018. Legendary trader Peter Brandt recently shared bullish predictions for XLM , and if buying pressure increases, the asset could overcome this resistance and meet his expectations. For both XRP and XLM, this resistance zone is not just a technical level, but represents a psychological barrier, with traders closely watching for signs of strength or weakness.

In a particular scenario, he used a $10 billion input to test XRP's response. Notably, at the time of the simulated buy, XRP traded at $2.97, with a total supply of 59.3 billion tokens, which put its market cap at $176.1 billion.After the tool applied the $10 billion order, XRP's price jumped to $90. This raised the market cap to $5.3 trillion, an increase of $5.2 trillion, or 2,930.3%. The model calculated a multiplier of 516x, showing that every $1 million worth of inflow could raise XRP's market cap by $516 million under the right conditions. XRP Market Cap Model XRP Market Cap Model To reach the $90 target, the order cleared out multiplier layers of the sell-side order book, beginning at $2.975 and steadily buying up liquidity at each level. This sweep continued until it consumed all available asks up to $90. The process showed how little XRP is available for sale at higher prices and how this scarcity can drive explosive price moves.Large Buy Orders with Thin Liquidity Could Catapult XRP to Higher TargetsInterestingly, Dom, a well-known analyst who studies order books closely, has pointed to this pattern for years. In late 2023, when XRP still traded below $1, he predicted that just $1 billion of buy pressure could push the price up by several dollars. Dom encouraged traders to look directly at the order book depth to see how little resistance existed beyond the early price levels.Meanwhile, last December, when XRP surpassed $2, Dom pointed to the same mechanics behind the sharp price spike. He explained that thin liquidity allowed for steep, almost vertical price jumps as soon as serious buy pressure arrived. The market expert noted that most XRP holders set extremely high price targets and likely won't sell even after big rallies, which only adds to the supply squeeze. He expected XRP to peak only when a flood of selling reappears.Moreover, three months back, Dom shared a real-time example that showed the multiplier model in action. Specifically, he tracked $61 million in net buying pressure across top exchanges over 13 hours. https://twitter.com/traderview2/status/1921959795801661608Notably, this buying pressure added $16.6 billion to XRP's market cap , resulting in a real-world multiplier of 272x. Highlighting this important instance, Dom stressed that market cap figures often mislead investors who don't understand how liquidity impacts price moves.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,1,new xrp market cap multiplier model show much buy volume would necessary send xrp price soaring model still development raw form illustrates predominant belief among xrp proponent xrp market cap could grow astronomically modest capital inflow also show powerful capital inflow liquidity limited xrp surged buy ordersphil kwok easya unveiled tool recent disclosure particular scenario used billion input test xrp response notably time simulated buy xrp traded total supply billion token put market cap tool applied billion order xrp price jumped raised market cap trillion increase trillion model calculated multiplier showing every million worth inflow could raise xrp market cap million right condition xrp market cap model xrp market cap model reach target order cleared multiplier layer order book beginning steadily buying liquidity level sweep continued consumed available asks process showed little xrp available sale higher price scarcity drive explosive price buy order thin liquidity could catapult xrp higher targetsinterestingly dom analyst study order book closely pointed pattern year late xrp still traded predicted billion buy pressure could push price several dollar dom encouraged trader look directly order book depth see little resistance existed beyond early price last december xrp surpassed dom pointed mechanic behind sharp price spike explained thin liquidity allowed steep almost vertical price jump soon serious buy pressure arrived market expert noted xrp holder set extremely high price target likely wo sell even big rally add supply squeeze expected xrp peak flood selling three month back dom shared example showed multiplier model action specifically tracked million net buying pressure across top exchange hour http buying pressure added billion xrp market cap resulting multiplier highlighting important instance dom stressed market cap figure often mislead investor understand liquidity impact price move,0.053,0.876,0.071,0.6697,1

Bitcoin dominance is rising, sending pressure across the altcoin market. Analyst says August could define Ethereum’s path for the year. The crypto market is sending mixed signals. Despite earlier hopes for an altcoin season, Bitcoin dominance in this cycle is rising, which usually means trouble for small-cap altcoins. While a few altcoins might do well, the overall altcoin market has shown signs of weakness. So while broader altcoins face pressure from BTC’s dominance, altcoin leader Ethereum still has a shot to flip the script. Related: Bitcoin Dominance Hits 3-Year High But Faces Historical August-September Slump Ethereum’s Make-or-Break Test in August Analyst Benjamin Cowen said that August will be a decisive month for Ethereum. If Ethereum can break above $4,000 soon, it could trigger a strong rally by the end of the year. If it fails to clear that resistance, however, Cowen suggests the price could enter a “slow grind,” likely finding support and forming a higher low in September before its next major attempt upward.

The cybersecurity firm Zimperium says the so-called DoubleTrouble trojan “has rapidly evolved in both its distribution methods and capabilities,” and is now permeating channels on the social platform Discord. “In its latest evolution, the malware has integrated several new and advanced features, significantly expanding its capabilities beyond earlier iterations. These enhancements enable more effective data theft, device manipulation, and evasion techniques. The new functionalities include: displaying malicious UI overlays to steal PIN codes or unlock patterns, comprehensive screen recording capabilities, the ability to block the opening of specific applications, and advanced keylogging functionality.” Researchers say the malware convinces users to download it by masking itself as an extension or an add-on, and it uses the Google Play icon to appear trustworthy. It also manipulates device functionality by exploiting Android’s Accessibility Services, allowing it to block legitimate banking or security apps with misleading “system maintenance” prompts. In addition, the malicious software simulates user actions like taps and swipes, allowing attackers to remotely control infected devices and steal data, including passwords and banking details, with alarming precision. The trojan’s attacks are ongoing, primarily targeting users in Europe through phishing websites and Discord-hosted APKs. Specific victim counts remain unknown at time of publishing.

2025-08-02 07:00:32,49405797,1754118032,"Live Crypto Price Prediction: XRP, ADA, XLM","With the crypto market entering a new phase of consolidation, investors are watching closely to see whether leading altcoins can resume their uptrend. XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM) have all seen strong rallies in recent weeks—but the question now is whether that momentum can continue. At the same time, early buyers are turning attention to newer, lower-cap opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is gaining traction for its aggressive growth pace and expanding user base, with analysts suggesting a potential upside of 37x once it hits key listings. XRP Eyes Rebound After $3.55 High XRP’s recent climb to $3.55 was followed by a correction to $3.12, where it is currently consolidating. Despite the pullback, whale accumulation continues. Many analysts believe a breakout could occur if ETF approval rumors resurface. Price Prediction: XRP could trade between $3.00 and $4.75 in the coming weeks, with upside hinging on regulatory catalysts and volume recovery. Early-Stage Frenzy Builds Anticipation MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract speculative attention. Insider reports suggest new rounds are closing within hours, as buyers aim to lock in early allocations. Some projections place the potential ROI as high as 37x , making it one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this quarter. If momentum continues through launch and listings, the token could be the next frontier of the altcoin season. ADA Forecast Looks Strong into Protocol Launch Cardano currently trades around $0.76, still significantly below its previous all-time high. With the Midnight protocol and ecosystem updates approaching, long-term buyers are beginning to accumulate. Price Prediction: ADA could revisit the $1.00–$1.20 range in Q3, with room to move higher if network growth accelerates. Stellar Holds Steady After Rapid Climb Stellar (XLM) surged to $0.55 in July before correcting to its current level of $0.41. RSI remains neutral, showing indecision—but some expect renewed movement if broader market sentiment improves. Price Prediction: If support holds, XLM may test the $0.48–$0.52 range, while a drop below $0.39 could open downside to $0.33. Conclusion XRP, ADA, and XLM are showing signs of stabilization after recent rallies, with traders watching key support and resistance levels. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as the breakout opportunity, with forecasts of up to 37x returns for early participants—fueling growing demand during its early stages.

Bitcoin Price Just Made A Low Under $115,000 Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market has witnessed a wave of bearish momentum during the past day as prices across the coins have declined. BTC went into the low $114,000 levels earlier in the day, but the coin has since bounced back above $115,000. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Here? 6 Key Metrics Show Market Shift The below chart shows how the asset’s recent performance has looked. Last week, BTC also dropped toward the $115,000 mark, but back then, it was able to quickly bounce back to resume sideways movement around $118,000. As such, it only remains to be seen whether the current deviation is a temporary one as well or if it’s the start of a real break away from the consolidation range. Most of the altcoins have taken a worse hit than the number one cryptocurrency during the past day, with some like Solana (SOL) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) exceeding losses of 5%. Crypto Derivatives Market Has Racked Up Large Liquidations A consequence of the market-wide volatility has been that liquidations have piled up over at the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector, according to data from CoinGlass. Below is a table that shows the numbers related to the latest market liquidations. As is visible above, a total of $804 million in cryptocurrency contracts have found liquidation during the past day. Out of these, $741 million of the contracts, equivalent to 92% of the total, were longs. Ethereum (ETH) led the derivatives flush with $250 million in liquidations, Bitcoin followed at $200 million. ETH topping the sector in this metric over BTC is likely a combination of two factors: its price has seen a steeper decline in the last 24 hours and speculative interest around it has been elevated due to the earlier breakout. Signs were already there that a volatile liquidation event may be coming. As this chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn on Wednesday shows, the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest was sharply climbing. The “Aggregated Open Interest” here naturally refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to BTC that are open on all centralized exchanges.

2025-08-02 06:55:11,49405435,1754117711,Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer’s Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer’s Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and few areas capture attention quite like Bitcoin mining . It’s the engine that powers the entire Bitcoin network, creating new coins and validating transactions. Recently, a significant player in this space, Bitdeer, shared some exciting news that highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset accumulation. This development offers a fascinating glimpse into the operations of large-scale miners and their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. Bitdeer, a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) cloud mining company, recently announced via X that it successfully mined a total of 63.1 BTC over the past week. This achievement not only demonstrates their operational efficiency but also provides valuable insight into their strategic asset management. The firm also sold 26.8 BTC during the same period, indicating a thoughtful approach to balancing liquidity with long-term holdings. Consequently, Bitdeer’s pure holdings have increased by 36.4 BTC, bringing their total to an impressive 1,637.8 BTC. This growth underscores the ongoing profitability and strategic importance of professional Bitcoin mining operations. What is Bitcoin Mining and How Does Bitdeer Excel? For those new to the crypto world, you might be wondering: what exactly is Bitcoin mining ? At its core, it is the process by which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation, and new transactions are added to the blockchain. This process involves powerful computers solving complex computational puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. It’s a critical function that ensures the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Bitdeer operates primarily as a cloud mining service. What does this mean? Instead of individuals buying and maintaining expensive mining hardware, they can purchase ‘hash rate’ from companies like Bitdeer. This allows them to participate in Bitcoin mining without the complexities of managing equipment, electricity costs, or cooling systems. Bitdeer leverages its vast infrastructure, advanced mining rigs, and optimized energy solutions to perform mining operations on a large scale. Their expertise in managing these complex systems allows them to achieve consistent mining outputs, as evidenced by their recent 63.1 BTC weekly haul. This model democratizes access to mining while centralizing the operational heavy lifting. Bitdeer’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: A Deep Dive into Growth Bitdeer’s recent report isn’t just about the quantity of Bitcoin mined; it also reveals a strategic approach to managing their digital assets. Mining 63.1 BTC in a week is a significant feat, but their decision to sell 26.8 BTC alongside this achievement provides a clearer picture of their operational strategy. This balancing act of accumulating new assets while liquidating a portion can be crucial for covering operational expenses, reinvesting in infrastructure, or managing market exposure. It reflects a sophisticated financial management strategy typical of large-scale crypto enterprises. The net increase of 36.4 BTC to their pure holdings, bringing the total to 1,637.8 BTC, demonstrates a clear long-term accumulation strategy. This indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and a commitment to growing their digital asset reserves. Understanding these movements is key to appreciating the financial health and strategic direction of a major Bitcoin mining entity. Let’s look at a simplified breakdown of their recent activity: Activity Amount (BTC) Impact on Holdings BTC Mined This Week 63.1 Increase BTC Sold This Week 26.8 Decrease Net Increase in Holdings 36.4 Positive Current Total Holdings 1,637.8 Accumulated This table illustrates the company’s dynamic management of its mined assets, highlighting a strategy that balances immediate needs with long-term accumulation. Such transparency from a major player like Bitdeer offers valuable data points for market analysts and investors. The Broader Impact of Robust Bitcoin Mining Operations The consistent success of large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Bitdeer has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Firstly, it contributes to the overall security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. The more miners there are, and the more robust their operations, the more secure the network becomes against potential attacks. Secondly, their operational scale influences the market dynamics. While mining introduces new supply, the strategic holding patterns of major miners can also impact market sentiment and available supply for trading. Furthermore, the growth of companies like Bitdeer drives innovation in the mining sector. This includes advancements in energy efficiency, the development of more powerful mining hardware, and the exploration of sustainable energy sources for mining. As the industry matures, the focus on environmental impact becomes more pronounced, pushing miners towards greener solutions. Bitdeer, like many other large players, is increasingly investing in renewable energy projects to power their operations, aligning with global sustainability goals. This shift is vital for the long-term viability and public perception of Bitcoin mining . The profitability of Bitcoin mining is also closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, as well as the network’s difficulty adjustment and the block reward halving events. With the recent halving, the block reward for miners was cut in half, making operational efficiency and strategic asset management even more critical for profitability. Companies like Bitdeer, with their established infrastructure and strong financial position, are better equipped to navigate these changes compared to smaller, less capitalized operations. Their ability to continue mining and accumulating BTC post-halving speaks volumes about their resilience and long-term vision. Challenges and Opportunities in the Bitcoin Mining Landscape While the recent figures from Bitdeer paint a positive picture, the Bitcoin mining industry is not without its challenges. Volatility in Bitcoin’s price directly impacts revenue. Energy costs, regulatory changes, and increasing network difficulty are constant factors that miners must navigate. The competition is fierce, and staying ahead requires continuous investment in technology and infrastructure. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities. The drive for greater energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources are pushing the industry towards a more sustainable future. Innovation in mining hardware continues to improve profitability and reduce operational footprints. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these dynamics is key. The strength of mining operations like Bitdeer can be seen as a barometer for the health and confidence within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Their continued accumulation of BTC signals a strong belief in the asset’s long-term value, providing a layer of stability and institutional backing to the market. The transparency provided by companies like Bitdeer, sharing their mining output and holdings, helps build trust and provides valuable data for market analysis. Conclusion Bitdeer’s recent announcement of mining 63.1 BTC and increasing its pure holdings to over 1,637 BTC highlights the robust and evolving nature of the Bitcoin mining industry. It showcases not only the company’s operational strength but also its strategic approach to asset management in a dynamic market. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the role of large-scale miners like Bitdeer becomes increasingly important in securing the network, driving innovation, and shaping the supply-side economics of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Their ongoing success is a testament to the enduring power and potential of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is cloud mining, and how does Bitdeer fit into it? Cloud mining allows individuals to participate in Bitcoin mining by renting computing power (hash rate) from a mining farm like Bitdeer, rather than owning and operating their own hardware. Bitdeer provides the infrastructure and expertise for large-scale mining operations. Q2: Why did Bitdeer sell some of the Bitcoin they mined? Selling a portion of mined Bitcoin is a common strategic move for mining companies. It helps cover operational costs, invest in new equipment, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market prices while still accumulating a net increase in their holdings. Q3: How does Bitcoin mining impact the Bitcoin network? Bitcoin mining is crucial for the network’s security and functionality. Miners validate transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new bitcoins. This process maintains the integrity and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Q4: What are the main challenges for Bitcoin mining companies today? Key challenges include the volatile price of Bitcoin, rising energy costs, increasing network difficulty (making mining harder), and evolving regulatory landscapes. The recent Bitcoin halving also significantly reduced block rewards, increasing pressure on profitability. Q5: How does Bitdeer’s accumulation of BTC affect the market? When large entities like Bitdeer accumulate significant amounts of BTC, it can signal long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Their strategic holding patterns can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially influencing market dynamics and sentiment. Q6: Is Bitcoin mining becoming more environmentally friendly? Yes, there is a growing trend towards more sustainable Bitcoin mining. Many large mining operations, including Bitdeer, are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources like hydro, solar, and wind power to reduce their carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency.

This has prompted project proponents and analysts to ask who is selling at such adverse times for the underlying asset’s price. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko It’s safe to say that the past few days have been quite painful for the entire cryptocurrency industry, with more than $250 billion evaporating from the total market cap. Bitcoin’s price tumbled to multi-week lows of under $113,000, while many altcoins have crashed by 5-10%. However, Pi Network’s native token has taken this correction even worse. Pi has slumped by 16% in the past day alone, and more than 30% monthly. As a result, it plunged to a new all-time low today at $0.34 (on CoinGecko), which broke the previous anti-record from yesterday. On some exchanges, the price slump was even more profound, prompting analysts like Moon Jeff to ask who is selling at such low levels. $PI broke below its previous low at 40 cents. Now at 0.32. I wonder who is still selling coins now. #Pinetwork pic.twitter.com/2nKUvv7LdL — MOON JEFF (@CRYPTOAD00) August 2, 2025 This price crash occurred after a massive token unlock period for Pi, in which the total daily number of freed coins frequently exceeded 10 million. Data from PiScan shows that there could be some relief in the near future. The token unlocks are set to be reduced in the next month, as only two days will see more than 7.5 million coins released. The average for the next month will be at 5.3 million, which is a lot fewer than the 7+ million in June and July. This could reduce the immediate selling pressure for Pi and perhaps stop the freefalls, at least for the time being. PI Token Unlock Schedule.

2025-08-02 06:32:13,49423635,1754116333,"Here is How High Shiba Inu Must Rise for SHIB to Clinch 3rd, 4th, or 5th Place in Crypto Rankings","Optimism about Shiba Inu’s potential push into the top five crypto rankings has been reignited as large investors indicate interest in SHIB. The broader Shiba Inu community eagerly anticipates SHIB’s potential ascent into the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Momentum behind this goal has surged since November 2024, when lead developer Shytoshi Kusama unveiled plans to propel SHIB into the top five rankings. Shiba Inu Lead's Ambitious Aspiration As previously reported , the Shiba Inu lead referenced an AI-generated painting depicting a man conducting research at a cluttered desk overflowing with books. Commenting, Kusama noted that it reflects how he tries to use a small budget to give SHIB utility and take the token to the top five crypto rankings in less than five years. It’s been nine months since Kusama shared this aspiration, and SHIB has dropped from the 13th position, where it sat at the time, to the 22nd place. Nonetheless, some enthusiasts have remained optimistic about SHIB’s potential to break into the crypto top five. This optimism has soared lately as large holders shift huge amounts of tokens from exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Last month, two unlabeled blockchain addresses withdrew 5 trillion SHIB and 110.34 billion tokens from Coinbase and Binance, respectively. For context, cracking the top 5 would place SHIB among the five largest cryptocurrencies in the world. This could see SHIB rank as either the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Growth Required to Position SHIB in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th Crypto Rankings Despite sitting in the 22nd position, we explored how high the token must rise to ascend to the third, fourth, or fifth place in the global crypto ranking. Notably, Shiba Inu is still trying to stage a rebound after reacting negatively to Trump’s new tariff plan, which sent it crashing below $0.000012. However, SHIB has rebounded above $0.000012 and currently trades at $0.000012, translating to a market cap of $7.2 billion. Currently, XRP, USDT, and BNB occupy the third, fourth, and fifth spots with market caps of $178.48 billion, $163.85 billion, and $106.99 billion, respectively. For Shiba Inu to claim the third place and potentially overtake XRP, its market cap would need to surge approximately 2,386% to about $179 billion. Similarly, elevating SHIB into the fourth slot and usurping USDT would require a 2,177% increase to $164 billion, and cracking the top five by surpassing BNB would demand a 1,400% climb to $108 billion. If Shiba Inu’s supply remains stable at 589 trillion tokens, achieving valuations of $108 billion, $164 billion, or $179 billion would propel SHIB’s price to $0.000183, $0.000278, or $0.000303, respectively. ChatGPT Insights on Projections According to ChatGPT, Shiba Inu’s potential surge to these targets is within the realm of possibility. The AI chatbot speculated that SHIB will attain the $0.000183 target over the next six months or by February 2026, potentially driven by a strong altcoin season. It speculated that it would take within 1 - 3 years for the asset to reach a price range of $0.000278 - $0.000303. ChatGPT believes that SHIB would require a historic bull run and breakthroughs to achieve these targets. ChatGPT forecast for SHIB rally ChatGPT forecast for SHIB rally Despite the bullish projection, caution is still required, given the volatility of the crypto market. Shiba Inu’s potential ascent to the third, fourth, or fifth place in the global crypto ranking could be hindered by the lack of institutional interest in the token. Shiba Inu has yet to get a single filing for a spot-based ETF, unlike other meme-based tokens, such as Dogecoin and Official Trump. Speculation suggests that the anonymous nature of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem team may be discouraging institutions from engaging with SHIB like other meme-based tokens.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,1,optimism shiba inu potential push top five crypto ranking reignited large investor indicate interest shib broader shiba inu community eagerly anticipates shib potential ascent top five cryptocurrencies market capitalization momentum behind goal surged since november lead developer shytoshi kusama unveiled plan propel shib top five ranking shiba inu lead ambitious aspiration previously reported shiba inu lead referenced painting depicting man conducting research cluttered desk overflowing book commenting kusama noted reflects try use small budget give shib utility take token top five crypto ranking less five year nine month since kusama shared aspiration shib dropped position sat time place nonetheless enthusiast remained optimistic shib potential break crypto top five optimism soared lately large holder shift huge amount token exchange like coinbase binance last month two unlabeled blockchain address withdrew trillion shib billion token coinbase binance respectively context cracking top would place shib among five largest cryptocurrencies world could see shib rank either first second third fourth cryptocurrency market cap growth required position shib crypto ranking despite sitting position explored high token must rise ascend third fourth fifth place global crypto ranking notably shiba inu still trying stage rebound reacting negatively trump new tariff plan sent crashing however shib rebounded currently trade translating market cap billion currently xrp usdt bnb occupy third fourth fifth spot market cap billion billion billion respectively shiba inu claim third place potentially overtake xrp market cap would need surge approximately billion similarly elevating shib fourth slot usurping usdt would require increase billion cracking top five surpassing bnb would demand climb billion shiba inu supply remains stable trillion token achieving valuation billion billion billion would propel shib price respectively chatgpt insight projection according chatgpt shiba inu potential surge target within realm possibility ai chatbot speculated shib attain target next six month february potentially driven strong altcoin season speculated would take within year asset reach price range chatgpt belief shib would require historic bull run breakthrough achieve target chatgpt forecast shib rally chatgpt forecast shib rally despite bullish projection caution still required given volatility crypto market shiba inu potential ascent third fourth fifth place global crypto ranking could hindered lack institutional interest token shiba inu yet get single filing etf unlike token dogecoin official trump speculation suggests anonymous nature shiba inu ecosystem team may discouraging institution engaging shib like token,0.023,0.796,0.181,0.9955,1

2025-08-02 06:30:30,49404489,1754116230,Crypto Insiders Say One Move Now Could Change Everything by September,"As the SEC rolls out its Project Crypto initiative – a landmark regulatory overhaul designed to support tokenized securities, DeFi integration, and streamlined issuance—many crypto insiders are pointing to September as a pivotal turning point . Analysts expect clear definitions and guidelines may unlock institutional and retail flows previously held back. In this landscape, investors are watching for projects that can merge momentum with structural credibility. One such emerging token increasingly mentioned in this circle—and appearing on trusted ledger lists – is MAGACOIN FINANCE, now riding peak visibility amid security validation and audit-backed trust. Why September may mark a structural shift in crypto trust Media reports and industry commentary suggest the SEC’s policy change is more than technical – it’s symbolic . By shifting toward supportive frameworks around token classifications, staking, and digital-ledger security, the agency may offer renewed confidence to institutions now positioning for regulatory clarity. As insiders pivot capital in anticipation, timing and trust credentials become critical entry points. High on credibility and trust metrics Unlike many early-stage altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a perfect 10/10 TrustScore from independent auditors – based on transparent tokenomics, fixed supply, verified smart contracts. Complementing this, the project has passed a full smart contract audit, with no critical vulnerabilities identified and structural integrity confirmed. Analysts consistently highlight its governance and public verification as rare strengths in the meme-token space. As regulations evolve, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a model case of early-stage altcoins built on structural transparency and audit-backed security. How these dynamics shape tactical investor decisions Historically, crypto cycles reward those who enter when both regulatory clarity and project legitimacy are aligning—before mainstream entry floods in. If September does usher in crypto-friendly policy, projects with public trust credentials and early technical validation are likely to outperform . Tokens that combine visible demand, audit transparency, and time-sensitive access often become the breakout candidates. MAGACOIN FINANCE now fits that profile—with its latest audit bolstering investor confidence in this critical phase. Conclusion: Timing, trust, and transparency converge Crypto insiders are eyeing the SEC’s reforms as a potential watershed moment – one that may change the playing field for early – stage assets . MAGACOIN FINANCE, fortified by independent audit ratings and TrustScore excellence, stands out as a token aligning momentum with legitimacy. Whether regulators deliver or not, the message is clear: when structural trust , audit credentials, and early visibility coincide, the long – term opportunity often follows. Investors positioning now may be able to capitalize before broader institutional adoption shifts the landscape.

The mission? Becoming the first token in the world that everybody holds, no matter their background, wealth, or level of crypto knowledge. What began as a bold experiment in fair tokenomics has evolved into a movement backed by data, unwavering community support, and unmatched staying power. HOLD sets out to be the Bitcoin on Ethereum, acting as a primary store of value with no one wallet owning more than 0.58% of the supply. Built Different from Day One At launch, HOLD introduced a revolutionary mechanism that took the entire market by surprise: no one could buy more than a tiny sliver of the supply. The buy limit increased slowly, eliminating early bot abuse and whale dominance. This approach inspired countless imitators, but none could match HOLD’s balance of fairness and organic growth. Then, the developer took it a step further—first buying 72.22% of the total supply with his own funds, and then burning it (see Etherscan ). The result: no central supply, no major dumps, and no future dilution. What remains is pure scarcity, controlled entirely by the retail investors. Backed by the Community, Not VC Money HOLD is a community takeover (CTO) project with no developer wallet or team wallet. The project is entirely community owned. From crypto veterans like Paddy (known for early calls on SHIB and Telcoin) and WIZZ , to community members grinding in X Spaces and IRL sticker warriors all over the world, $HOLD is powered by real people—not insiders or VCs. That means no VC wallets, no airdrops, and no token unlocks. HOLD’s grassroots movement continues to grow, with nearly 2,000 new holders in the last 90 days alone. Impeccable strength and tenure Having survived 660 days in the crypto trenches proves the strength of HOLD and its community. In this time, HOLD has survived three 80%+ pullbacks. This is significant and stands as a milestone in the crypto community, and the holder base has changed from early adopters to diehard believers. HOLD has achieved what many projects only dream of, and is primed for its next stage as we head into the strongest crypto bull market the world has ever seen, with a chart that calls to mind similar projects like SPX, SHIB, and DOGE, only with much greater upside potential. Soon Everybody Will Hold The mission of HOLD is simple but powerful: Everybody Will Hold. Everybody in crypto, then eventually everybody on Earth. Already, the community is spreading the word in over 40 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. With its unrivaled distribution and supply dynamics, HOLD has become a universal symbol of fairness, community, and shared opportunity in crypto. Now Live on Base With a new deployment on the Base chain, HOLD begins its next chapter. Faster and less expensive transactions bring accessibility to a new wave of holders, without compromising the original mission. Both smart contracts are now live: ETH Contract: 0x68b36248477277865c64dfc78884ef80577078f3 BASE Contract: 0x9493c825f691f272ce12b0d001b746130629bf71 HOLD Stats (July 2025) Price: $0.0093 Market Cap: $25.7M Holders: 4490 Circ.

2025-08-02 06:25:10,49404180,1754115910,BTC Long-Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Insights for Smarter Futures Trading,"BitcoinWorld BTC Long-Short Ratio: Unveiling Crucial Insights for Smarter Futures Trading In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, understanding market sentiment is paramount. For Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures, one of the most revealing indicators is the BTC long-short ratio . This metric offers a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate a price increase (long) or a decrease (short). It is not just a number; it is a pulse check of the market’s collective conviction, a tool that can empower traders to make more informed decisions. By analyzing these ratios, we can gain valuable insights into potential market movements and identify shifts in investor psychology. What Exactly Is the BTC Long-Short Ratio? The BTC long-short ratio is a simple yet powerful indicator that reflects the proportion of long positions versus short positions on a given cryptocurrency exchange for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative product that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. Long Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will increase. They profit if the price goes up. Short Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will decrease. They profit if the price goes down. The Ratio Calculation: The ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of long positions by the total number or volume of short positions. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 indicates more short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment. Our data presents it as percentages for easier understanding. This ratio provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among leveraged traders. When a significant majority of traders are leaning one way, it can sometimes signal an impending reversal, as extreme positioning often precedes a shift in market direction. Decoding the Daily BTC Long-Short Ratio Landscape Let us examine the recent 24-hour BTC long-short ratio data for Bitcoin perpetual futures across several prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. This data offers immediate insight into current market positioning: Metric Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Across Exchanges 48.22% 51.78% Binance 48.05% 51.95% Bybit 47.12% 52.88% Gate.io 49.96% 50.04% As observed from the table, the aggregated data indicates a slight dominance of short positions, with 51.78% of traders leaning bearish compared to 48.22% leaning bullish. This suggests a cautious or slightly negative sentiment among futures traders over the past 24 hours. Individual exchange data largely mirrors this trend, with Bybit showing the strongest bearish bias and Gate.io exhibiting a near-even split, indicating diverse sentiment across platforms. This collective positioning is a key aspect of understanding the current market mood regarding the BTC long-short ratio . Why Do These BTC Long-Short Ratios Matter for Your Trading Strategy? Understanding the BTC long-short ratio is not just an academic exercise; it provides practical utility for your trading strategy. This metric offers several benefits for traders looking to gain an edge in the volatile crypto market: Sentiment Gauge: The most direct application is as a sentiment indicator. A high percentage of long positions suggests optimism, while a high percentage of short positions indicates pessimism. This can help confirm or contradict your own market bias. Contrarian Signals: Extreme imbalances in the ratio can sometimes act as contrarian signals. For instance, if the ratio shows an overwhelming number of long positions, it might suggest that the market is overextended, and a correction or reversal could be imminent. Similarly, an excessive number of short positions might indicate a potential short squeeze or bounce. Liquidation Risk Assessment: When one side of the market is heavily leveraged, it creates a pool of potential liquidations. If the price moves against the majority, these liquidations can trigger cascading effects, leading to rapid price swings. Monitoring the BTC long-short ratio can help anticipate such volatility. Confirmation Tool: The ratio can be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and on-chain data to confirm trading signals. For example, if a chart pattern suggests a bullish breakout, and the long-short ratio is also increasing, it could provide stronger conviction for a long trade. Challenges and Nuances in Interpreting BTC Long-Short Ratios While the BTC long-short ratio is a valuable tool, it is not without its complexities and limitations. A nuanced understanding is crucial to avoid misinterpretations: Data Aggregation Issues: The data often comes from various exchanges, and not all platforms provide transparent or real-time ratio information. Aggregated data, while useful, might not capture the full picture of the entire market. Context is Paramount: The ratio should never be used in isolation. It must be analyzed alongside other key metrics such as funding rates, open interest, price action, and broader macroeconomic factors. A high long ratio during a strong uptrend might be healthy, whereas the same ratio during a consolidation phase could signal a top. Whale Influence: Large institutional traders or ‘whales’ can significantly skew the ratio with their substantial positions. Their motives might differ from retail traders, and their positioning could be part of a larger strategy not immediately apparent from the ratio alone. Short-Term Focus: The 24-hour BTC long-short ratio primarily reflects short-term sentiment. While useful for day traders, it might not provide significant insights for long-term investors. Longer timeframes or aggregated historical data might be needed for broader trend analysis. Lagging vs. Leading Indicator: In some scenarios, the ratio can be a lagging indicator, reflecting what has already happened. In others, particularly at extremes, it can be a leading indicator of potential reversals. Discerning this requires experience and careful observation. Actionable Insights: Leveraging BTC Long-Short Ratios in Your Trading Now that we have explored what the BTC long-short ratio is and its nuances, let us discuss how to practically apply this knowledge to enhance your trading decisions: Identify Extreme Ratios: Pay close attention when the ratio deviates significantly from its historical average or approaches extreme levels (e.g., 70%+ long or 70%+ short). These extremes often precede significant price movements or reversals. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, consider if the market is due for a pullback as ‘fuel’ for short liquidations builds. Combine with Funding Rates: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts are fees paid between long and short positions to keep the contract price close to the spot price. A high positive funding rate combined with a high long-short ratio can indicate an overheated market, making long positions riskier. Conversely, negative funding rates with a high short ratio might suggest a potential short squeeze. Observe Divergences: Look for divergences between the ratio and price action. If Bitcoin’s price is making higher highs, but the BTC long-short ratio is showing a decreasing number of long positions, it could signal weakening bullish momentum or a lack of conviction from new buyers. Risk Management: Use the ratio to inform your risk management. If the market is heavily skewed in one direction, consider reducing your leverage or taking partial profits if you are on the side of the majority. If you are taking a contrarian position, ensure you have tight stop-losses. Track Across Exchanges: While the aggregate ratio is helpful, observe individual exchange ratios as well. Significant differences might indicate localized liquidity or specific trading dynamics on certain platforms. By integrating these actionable insights, traders can move beyond simply observing the BTC long-short ratio to actively using it as a component of a robust trading strategy. The Future of Market Sentiment: What’s Next for BTC Long-Short Ratios? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and so too are the tools and metrics traders use to navigate it. The BTC long-short ratio will continue to be a vital indicator for gauging short-term sentiment and potential market turning points. As the market matures and more sophisticated trading strategies emerge, the interpretation of these ratios may also evolve. The rise of institutional participation, advancements in algorithmic trading, and increasing regulatory clarity could all influence how these ratios behave and what signals they convey. Therefore, continuous learning and adaptation are essential for any trader relying on this metric. Staying informed about broader market trends and technological developments will enhance your ability to effectively utilize the BTC long-short ratio for future trading success. Conclusion The BTC long-short ratio provides a powerful lens through which to view the immediate sentiment of Bitcoin perpetual futures traders. While the recent 24-hour data suggests a slight bearish bias across major exchanges, it is crucial to remember that this metric is most effective when interpreted within a broader context. By understanding its calculation, recognizing its benefits as a sentiment and contrarian indicator, and acknowledging its limitations, traders can integrate this valuable tool into their analytical framework. Employing actionable insights such as identifying extremes, combining with funding rates, and practicing diligent risk management will enable you to leverage the BTC long-short ratio to navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater confidence and precision. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin perpetual future? A Bitcoin perpetual future is a derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. It is designed to track the underlying Bitcoin price closely through a funding rate mechanism. How does the BTC long-short ratio reflect market sentiment? The BTC long-short ratio reflects market sentiment by showing the proportion of traders betting on a price increase (long) versus those betting on a price decrease (short). A higher percentage of long positions indicates bullish sentiment, while a higher percentage of short positions indicates bearish sentiment. Can the BTC long-short ratio predict price movements? While the BTC long-short ratio is a strong indicator of sentiment and can sometimes precede price movements, especially at extreme levels, it is not a standalone predictor. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for more accurate predictions. Why do different exchanges show slightly different BTC long-short ratios? Differences in ratios across exchanges can be due to varying user bases, trading strategies prevalent on each platform, and the specific algorithms or methodologies they use to calculate and present the ratio data. Each exchange has its own unique liquidity and trader demographics. Is a high short ratio always a bad sign for Bitcoin’s price? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates prevailing bearish sentiment, extreme short positioning can sometimes lead to a ‘short squeeze.’ This occurs when the price unexpectedly rises, forcing short sellers to buy back their positions to cover losses, which further fuels the price increase. How often should I check the BTC long-short ratio? The frequency depends on your trading style. For day traders, checking the ratio hourly or every few hours might be beneficial. For swing traders, daily or even weekly checks might suffice to understand broader sentiment shifts.

2025-08-02 06:15:11,49403726,1754115311,ARK Invest Crypto: Cathie Wood’s Astounding Bet on Digital Asset Growth,"BitcoinWorld ARK Invest Crypto: Cathie Wood’s Astounding Bet on Digital Asset Growth The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and leading the charge are firms like ARK Invest, renowned for their visionary approach to disruptive innovation. When we talk about significant moves in this space, especially concerning institutional adoption, the spotlight often turns to ARK Invest crypto strategies. The firm, under the leadership of Cathie Wood, has consistently demonstrated a willingness to invest in areas they believe will shape the future, and cryptocurrency is undoubtedly one such frontier. Recently, ARK Invest made headlines again with another substantial acquisition in the digital asset sector. On August 1st, the firm purchased an additional $29.79 million in Coinbase shares and $17.129 million in Bitmain shares. This latest move, reported by Ark Invest Daily on X, underscores ARK’s unwavering confidence in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It’s a powerful signal that despite market fluctuations, ARK Invest sees fundamental value and growth opportunities within this nascent industry. What’s Behind ARK Invest Crypto’s Latest Strategic Moves? ARK Invest’s investment philosophy centers on identifying and capitalizing on disruptive innovation. Their latest acquisitions in Coinbase (COIN) and Bitmain, though a private entity and accessed likely through specific funds or derivatives given its private status, align perfectly with this core belief. These aren’t just speculative bets; they represent a strategic positioning within key pillars of the crypto economy. Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform in the United States, providing a gateway for millions of users to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Investing in Coinbase offers exposure to the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies, transaction volumes, and the overall growth of the crypto user base. It’s a direct play on the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. Bitmain, on the other hand, is a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining industry, particularly known for its ASIC miners. An investment in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, provides a stake in the foundational infrastructure of various proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. It’s about investing in the hardware that secures and enables these decentralized networks. This dual approach provides diversified exposure to the ARK Invest crypto thesis. To better visualize the scale of these recent acquisitions, consider the breakdown: Company Investment Amount (USD) Role in Crypto Ecosystem Coinbase (COIN) $29.79 Million Leading Crypto Exchange, Custody Services Bitmain $17.129 Million Dominant Crypto Mining Hardware Manufacturer Why is Coinbase a Core Component of ARK Invest Crypto Holdings? Coinbase represents a significant piece of the puzzle for ARK Invest crypto strategy due to several compelling factors. Firstly, as one of the most recognized and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, Coinbase offers a crucial on-ramp for both retail and institutional investors. Its compliance efforts and public listing provide a level of transparency and legitimacy that many other crypto ventures lack, aligning with ARK’s focus on investable innovation. Secondly, Coinbase benefits directly from the network effect of increasing crypto adoption. As more individuals and institutions enter the crypto space, Coinbase’s trading volumes, custody services, and subscription revenues are likely to grow. This positions it as a beneficiary of the overall expansion of the digital asset economy, regardless of which specific cryptocurrencies gain prominence. Furthermore, Coinbase is actively expanding its offerings beyond simple trading, venturing into areas like staking services, institutional custody, and a burgeoning developer ecosystem. This diversification provides multiple avenues for revenue growth and strengthens its position as a foundational player. For ARK Invest, owning Coinbase shares is a strategic bet on the infrastructure of the future digital financial system. How Does Bitmain Complement the ARK Invest Crypto Vision? While Coinbase focuses on the user-facing side of crypto, Bitmain delves into the very foundation of certain digital assets. Bitmain is a powerhouse in the design and manufacturing of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes it a critical player in the security and operation of these decentralized networks. Investing in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, allows ARK Invest to gain exposure to the underlying hardware layer of the crypto industry. This provides a different, yet equally vital, exposure compared to an exchange. It’s a play on the ongoing need for computational power to validate transactions and secure blockchain networks. As Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies continue to operate, the demand for efficient mining hardware persists. This strategic move highlights ARK’s comprehensive view of the crypto market, acknowledging that both the front-end user experience (Coinbase) and the back-end infrastructure (Bitmain) are essential for the long-term viability and growth of the digital asset ecosystem. It demonstrates a holistic understanding of how the ARK Invest crypto portfolio can gain exposure to various critical aspects of the industry. What Are the Broader Implications of ARK Invest Crypto Investments? These consistent investments by ARK Invest, particularly in high-profile companies like Coinbase and key infrastructure providers like Bitmain, send a powerful message to the broader financial market. They signify increasing institutional confidence in the legitimacy and staying power of digital assets. When a firm with the reputation and research capabilities of ARK Invest makes such moves, it often encourages other institutional players to take a closer look. Validation of the Asset Class: ARK’s continued buying reinforces the idea that cryptocurrencies are not just a fleeting trend but a legitimate and evolving asset class with long-term potential. Diversification Strategy: For ARK’s various ETFs, these investments provide diversified exposure to the crypto market beyond simply holding Bitcoin or Ethereum directly. They offer a way to participate in the growth of the infrastructure and service providers. Market Sentiment Influence: Cathie Wood’s pronouncements and ARK’s investment decisions often move markets. Their acquisitions can generate positive sentiment and draw attention to the underlying companies and the crypto sector as a whole. Focus on Innovation: The acquisitions underscore ARK’s commitment to investing in disruptive technologies. They view blockchain and digital assets as fundamental innovations that will reshape various industries. The consistent pattern of these acquisitions by ARK Invest crypto funds suggests a deeply held conviction in the transformative power of decentralized technologies and digital currencies. It’s a long-term vision that looks beyond daily price fluctuations to the fundamental shifts occurring in finance and technology. What Challenges Might ARK Invest Crypto Holdings Face? While ARK Invest’s bullish stance on crypto is clear, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with investing in this volatile sector. No investment is without its hurdles, and digital assets present a unique set: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and by extension, companies whose revenues are tied to them, can experience significant and rapid fluctuations. This volatility can impact the short-to-medium term performance of ARK’s holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains largely undefined in many jurisdictions, including the United States. Changes in regulations could significantly impact companies like Coinbase, affecting their operations, compliance costs, and business models. Competition: The crypto space is highly competitive, with new exchanges, mining operations, and blockchain technologies emerging constantly. This competition could erode market share or profitability for existing players. Technological Risks: While blockchain technology is robust, it’s still evolving. Risks such as security breaches, protocol vulnerabilities, or unexpected technological shifts could impact the entire ecosystem. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate changes, and global liquidity can also influence investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially affecting the performance of ARK Invest crypto assets. ARK Invest is known for its long-term investment horizon, often looking beyond short-term market noise. However, these challenges remain important considerations for any investor evaluating the digital asset space. Conclusion: ARK Invest’s Enduring Vision for Digital Assets ARK Invest’s continued accumulation of shares in companies like Coinbase and Bitmain is more than just a series of transactions; it’s a reaffirmation of their profound conviction in the future of digital assets. Cathie Wood and her team are not simply reacting to market trends; they are actively positioning their portfolios to benefit from what they believe will be one of the most significant technological and financial transformations of our era. Their strategic focus on both the user-facing platforms and the underlying infrastructure demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the crypto ecosystem’s growth drivers. These moves underscore a belief that despite the inherent volatility and regulatory headwinds, the long-term trajectory for digital assets is upward. For investors watching the space, ARK Invest’s consistent commitment to ARK Invest crypto investments serves as a powerful indicator of institutional confidence and a potential roadmap for how established finance views the evolving digital frontier. It’s a compelling narrative of innovation meeting investment, shaping the financial landscape for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ARK Invest?

2025-08-02 06:13:09,49403696,1754115189,"An Unusual Proposal Has Been Put Forward for a Surprise Altcoin: If It Happens, It Will Be a First","Phil_00Llama, an active member of CurveDAO (CRV), has presented a compelling proposal to halt the future expansion of decentralized exchange Curve Finance onto Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks. The proposal follows a similar call last month by Aave co-founder Marc Zeller to halt the deployment of the Aave protocol on the Bitcoin Layer 2 network BOB. “L2s consume the time of talented developers. Each of these chains requires as much care as Ethereum, but the returns are minimal. By cutting development in this area, Curve can focus on more productive aspects,” phil_00Llama said in a post on the CurveDAO forum yesterday. For years, Ethereum has adopted a “rollup-centric roadmap” strategy, aiming to increase scalability through Layer 2 solutions. However, this approach is now being questioned by some. Some advocate for a renewed focus on Ethereum's core layer (Layer 1). Related News: Nasdaq-listed Company Announces Major Bitcoin and Solana Purchase Curve Finance is active on approximately 25 chains, including Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and many more. However, according to DeFiLlama data, the platform's total locked value (TVL) is almost entirely on the Ethereum mainnet: approximately $2.3 billion. Layer 2 platforms Arbitrum and Base only hold around $50 million in TVL. phil_00Llama justifies this by saying, “Curve’s pools on the Ethereum mainnet generate 450 times more revenue than all L2s combined, even on the slowest day.” He also argues that the focus should be on expanding Curve’s stablecoin solution, scrvUSD, on Ethereum. A CurveDAO member noted that L2 deployments only generate around $1,500 per day in revenue, making it an inefficient strategy given the high maintenance costs and short-lived network structures. He argued that developers should focus on “more meaningful work” instead. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-02 06:10:10,49403539,1754115010,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation, and at the heart of the latest discussion is a bold Bitcoin price prediction from a familiar name: Arthur Hayes. As co-founder of the prominent BitMEX crypto exchange, Hayes’s insights carry significant weight within the digital asset community. His recent pronouncements via X suggest that Bitcoin could be on a trajectory to test the monumental $100,000 mark, with Ethereum potentially reaching $3,000. But what exactly underpins this audacious forecast, and what does it mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into the macroeconomic forces and strategic thinking that could propel these digital giants to new heights. What’s Driving Arthur Hayes’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Arthur Hayes’s outlook isn’t merely a speculative guess; it’s rooted in a nuanced analysis of global macroeconomic conditions, particularly focusing on the United States. His recent observations highlight that the full impact of U.S. tariff policies is expected to become significantly more apparent in the third quarter of the year. This assessment comes in the wake of critical U.S. nonfarm payroll data, which provides a snapshot of the nation’s economic health and labor market dynamics. Hayes underscores a critical point: “No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” This statement is central to his Bitcoin price prediction . In essence, he argues that the traditional economic engines of major economies are struggling to generate sufficient credit growth to stimulate nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). When traditional financial systems face such constraints, investors often seek alternative assets that are less correlated with conventional markets or that offer a hedge against potential inflation or economic stagnation. Key factors contributing to Hayes’s perspective include: U.S. Tariff Policies: These policies can disrupt global supply chains, influence trade balances, and impact inflation, potentially leading to a flight of capital into non-traditional assets. Nonfarm Payroll Data: While seemingly a labor market indicator, its implications extend to consumer spending, economic growth, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Weak or stagnant growth signals can prompt investors to look for store-of-value assets. Credit Creation Deficit: A lack of sufficient credit growth means less money flowing into productive economic activities, which can depress nominal GDP. This scenario often pushes capital into assets perceived as scarce or independent of traditional financial system vulnerabilities, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding the Macroeconomic Undercurrents Influencing Bitcoin Hayes’s analysis suggests a deeper interplay between global finance and the crypto market. The concept of “credit creation” is fundamental to how economies grow. When banks lend money, they create new credit, which fuels investment, consumption, and ultimately, nominal GDP. If this process slows down significantly across major economies, it implies a tightening of financial conditions or a lack of robust economic activity. In such an environment, assets that exist outside the traditional banking system, like cryptocurrencies, can become attractive. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is particularly appealing due to its decentralized nature, finite supply, and perceived resistance to inflationary pressures. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and burgeoning role in the Web3 space, also stands to benefit as capital seeks innovative and independent avenues. Consider the potential ripple effects: Economic Factor Impact on Traditional Markets Potential Effect on Crypto (BTC/ETH) Slow Credit Growth Reduced nominal GDP, potential stagnation Increased demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin Tariff Policy Impacts Supply chain disruption, inflation concerns Hedge against inflation, flight to digital gold Weak Nonfarm Payrolls Signals economic slowdown, lower consumer confidence Investors seek uncorrelated assets, pushing the Bitcoin price prediction higher Arthur Hayes’s Personal Market Moves: A Strategic Insight into Bitcoin’s Future? Interestingly, Hayes’s optimistic Bitcoin price prediction comes alongside some notable personal trading activity. Earlier, he offloaded significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethena (ENA). While this might seem counterintuitive to a bullish stance, it often reflects sophisticated portfolio management or tactical positioning rather than a loss of faith in the long-term potential of these assets. Details of his recent offloads: Asset Amount Offloaded Approximate USD Value Ethereum (ETH) 2,373 ETH $8.32 million Ethena (ENA) 7.76 million ENA $4.62 million Arthur Hayes’s strategic moves are often closely watched by the crypto community for insights into market trends and potential shifts in the Bitcoin price prediction. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future Such moves could indicate several strategies: Profit Taking: Cashing out gains from recent rallies to secure profits. Rebalancing: Adjusting portfolio allocation to increase exposure to other assets, or to raise cash for future opportunities. Tax Planning: Strategic sales can sometimes be related to managing tax liabilities. Funding Other Ventures: Capital might be needed for investments in new projects or personal endeavors. It is important to differentiate between a short-term tactical trade and a long-term fundamental belief. Hayes’s continued public optimism regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum’s future suggests his recent sales are likely part of a broader, more sophisticated financial strategy, rather than a sign of diminishing conviction in his long-term Bitcoin price prediction . Is a $100K Bitcoin Target a Realistic Outlook? The idea of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is not new, but it consistently garners attention. Arthur Hayes’s specific macroeconomic rationale adds another layer of credibility to this often-discussed target. While such a surge would represent significant gains for investors, it’s crucial to consider the various factors that could influence this trajectory. Potential Benefits of a $100K Bitcoin: Increased Mainstream Adoption: Higher prices often bring more institutional and retail interest, further legitimizing crypto. Network Effect: A rising price can attract more developers, users, and capital into the ecosystem, strengthening its foundation. Wealth Creation: Significant returns for early investors and those who have held through market cycles. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: The path to $100K is unlikely to be smooth, with potential for sharp corrections. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto gains prominence, so does the attention from regulators, which can introduce new challenges. Global Economic Shocks: Unforeseen global events could alter the macroeconomic landscape Hayes describes. Competition: While Bitcoin is dominant, the broader crypto market is dynamic, with new innovations emerging. Many analysts and models, including stock-to-flow models and various quantitative analyses, have projected Bitcoin reaching or exceeding $100,000 in cycles past or in the near future. Hayes’s unique perspective, tying it to specific macroeconomic indicators like credit creation and tariff impacts, offers a fresh lens through which to view this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction . It emphasizes that traditional financial pressures can paradoxically fuel growth in decentralized assets. Arthur Hayes’s compelling Bitcoin price prediction for $100,000, and Ethereum for $3,000, provides a fascinating look into how macroeconomic shifts could drive the next major crypto bull run. His insights into U.S. tariff policies and the global credit crunch offer a robust framework for understanding why he believes digital assets are poised for significant appreciation. While his personal trading activities might appear contradictory at first glance, they likely represent strategic maneuvers within a larger, bullish long-term vision. As the third quarter unfolds and economic data continues to emerge, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if Hayes’s bold forecast becomes a reality, cementing Bitcoin’s role as a formidable asset in an evolving global economy. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Prediction Q1: Who is Arthur Hayes? A1: Arthur Hayes is the co-founder of BitMEX, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. He is well-known for his insightful macroeconomic analyses and bold predictions within the crypto space. Q2: What is Arthur Hayes’s latest Bitcoin price prediction? A2: Arthur Hayes expects Bitcoin (BTC) to test the $100,000 level and Ethereum (ETH) to test the $3,000 level. This is his latest Bitcoin price prediction . Q3: What factors influence Arthur Hayes’s Bitcoin price prediction? A3: Hayes’s prediction is primarily influenced by the anticipated impact of U.S. tariff policies becoming more apparent in Q3, and his observation that “no major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” These macroeconomic conditions suggest a shift of capital towards decentralized assets. Q4: Why did Arthur Hayes offload ETH and ENA if he’s bullish on crypto? A4: Personal trading activities like offloading assets often reflect sophisticated portfolio management strategies, such as profit-taking, rebalancing, or funding other ventures, rather than a change in long-term conviction. It is common for traders to take profits even if they remain bullish on the overall market direction and their Bitcoin price prediction . Q5: How do U.S. tariff policies affect Bitcoin’s price? A5: U.S. tariff policies can disrupt global trade, potentially leading to inflation or economic uncertainty. In such scenarios, investors may seek safe-haven assets or inflation hedges, and Bitcoin is often seen as a digital alternative to traditional stores of value, which can drive its price up. Q6: What is “credit creation” and why is it important for the economy? A6: Credit creation refers to the process by which banks lend money, effectively creating new money in the economy. This credit fuels investment, consumption, and economic growth (nominal GDP). A slowdown in credit creation can indicate economic stagnation, making alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing.

2025-08-02 06:00:39,49403566,1754114439,"Top Crypto Gems to Buy Under $1: Why BDAG, ADA, TRX & XLM Are Breaking Out","Low prices in crypto often fool new users into thinking the project lacks potential. A coin sitting below the $1 mark might seem like small stakes, but in reality, it could hold much more promise than others trading at higher prices. The shift in the community’s mindset is clear now; today’s participants look beyond prices and focus more on practical developments and strong foundations. Names like BlockDAG, Cardano, TRON, and Stellar are proving that affordability doesn’t mean a lack of progress. These top crypto gems to buy under $1 are making real progress across different use cases. They’re not gaining attention just for their low prices but for the solid moves happening in the background. Let’s dive into why each one is gaining traction. 1. BlockDAG: Rising Presale Giant Already Raised $358M Excitement around BlockDAG (BDAG) is no longer based on speculation. The project is showing real action, backed by working apps, user engagement, and strong funding. At $0.0016 per coin, BlockDAG remains accessible but has shown momentum that can’t be ignored. The presale remains open until August 11th at this price. So far, BlockDAG has sold 24.6 billion coins and raised $358 million in total presale funding, reflecting strong user confidence. With a launch price of $0.05, early supporters have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660% since batch 1. That return is rare in today’s market and continues to attract attention. What’s more, BlockDAG has successfully hosted miner demo events globally, showing its X1 and X10 products in real use. It now boasts over 4,500 builders, daily competitions like Buyer Battles, and a 15% referral reward, all of which are helping increase participation. The growing activity suggests BlockDAG could climb toward $1, and with many speculating long-term targets between $5 and $10, the upside remains large. At its current price point, BDAG stands out as one of the top crypto gems to buy under $1. With limited time left in the presale and increasing demand, it’s attracting growing attention across the crypto space. 2. Cardano: Resilient Structure and Smart Contract Strength Cardano’s development strategy, built on academic research and proof-of-stake mechanisms, gives it a unique position. It’s energy-efficient and ideal for scaling decentralized applications. The focus has always been on sustainability, long-term development, and reliable upgrades. Since early July, Cardano’s price has surged over 50%, breaking through a 230-day resistance level. Analysts see an ascending triangle forming on its chart, often a bullish sign for future growth. With a previous all-time high of $3.10, even a partial return to that range could deliver 3x–4x growth. Among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, Cardano’s ongoing research-backed development and its use in real-world applications make it a solid long-term option for those watching fundamentals closely. 3. TRON: High Volume and Fast Payments Set It Apart Hovering around $0.33, TRON focuses on powering content platforms, games, and apps that need fast transactions. The platform processes over $2 trillion in stablecoin transactions each quarter, one of the highest volumes across any blockchain. It also handles more than 2,000 transactions every second, making it extremely efficient. TRON has just passed the $0.30 threshold, showing signs of bullish movement. Its solid activity levels, rising developer community, and wide adoption continue to support strong long-term possibilities. Market analysts suggest a jump toward $5–$7 could be realistic, with a full breakout to $15–$20 possible if global use spikes. Thanks to these strengths, TRON deserves its place among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, especially for those tracking usage metrics and developer traction. 4. Stellar: Evolving With Major Partnerships and Payment Tools Stellar sits close to $0.42 and focuses on simplifying payments across borders. By linking banks, businesses, and those without access to banking, Stellar builds payment solutions for developing economies. It has kept fees low and speeds fast, thanks to upgrades like Protocol 23. The project has partnered with top firms like IBM, PayPal, and MoneyGram, which increases its utility in financial services. These collaborations helped boost Stellar’s price by 30% in recent weeks, and there’s speculation of further gains ahead. With a push into the global payment space and improving features, Stellar holds strong potential to reach $5 to $10 over time, or even $20 with broader expansion. That momentum secures Stellar’s name among the top crypto gems to buy under $1. To Sum Up! Some of the most successful digital currencies began their journeys trading for pennies. BlockDAG has already seen 2,660% growth since its first presale batch and recently hosted successful miner product demos. With over 4,500 active builders, the excitement around BDAG is real and growing as it nears the final phase of its presale. Meanwhile, Cardano’s chart strength, TRON’s massive stablecoin transaction volumes, and Stellar’s partnerships with global firms all showcase why these coins are more than just low-cost plays. These four names, BlockDAG, Cardano, TRON, and Stellar, are the top crypto gems to buy under $1 for those focused on long-term tech growth and adoption.

Among the standout names, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured analyst attention with bold upside projections. Market experts forecast that a $4,500 position in MAGACOIN FINANCE could become $52,500 , based on current momentum and rapid presale growth. With a deflationary token model and viral appeal, it is positioned as one of the most compelling entries of Q3. Four other tokens—Wall Street Pepe, Haedal, Bitget Token, and SkyArk Chronicles – are drawing increased interest across social platforms and analyst circles. Each brings something unique to the table, whether it’s cultural relevance, staking utility, CEX backing, or gaming utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Predict a 10x Upside Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE blends meme culture with a pro-freedom message that has gone viral across X and Telegram. Its presale has already passed multiple milestones, signaling strong early-stage demand. Analysts believe that the token’s appeal lies not only in its branding but also in its aggressive deflationary structure and reward – driven referral model. With market sentiment improving, MAGACOIN is viewed as one of the few meme coins with both high upside and lasting momentum. The forecast? A $4,500 allocation potentially reaching $52,500 if current buyer enthusiasm holds. Wall Street Pepe (WSPE): Meme Culture Meets Market Power Wall Street Pepe is culturally resonant meme tokens of the year. Mixing themes of financial rebellion, meme warfare, and old-school trading aesthetics, WSPE has drawn in thousands of holders and continues to trend on DEXTools. With ongoing community campaigns and token burns, it’s maintaining high engagement while preparing for potential Tier 1 exchange listings. For traders looking for a narrative-rich meme coin with staying power, WSPE is becoming possible option Haedal: Cross-Chain Staking With Real Yield Utility Haedal is a new staking-focused project that’s generating buzz for its ability to provide real yield across multiple blockchains. It offers a user-friendly dashboard for managing staking portfolios and earns rewards by integrating both on-chain validator infrastructure and off-chain partnerships. Analysts are watching Haedal closely as capital continues flowing into DeFi platforms with reliable APY potential and cross-chain accessibility. Its combination of usability and functionality makes it one of August’s most practical candidates. Bitget Token (BGB): CEX-Backed Momentum Builder Bitget Token, the native coin of the Bitget exchange, is experiencing renewed momentum as exchange volumes pick up. With Bitget expanding its ecosystem, launching new staking products, and incentivizing BGB holders, demand is surging both from traders and long-term holders. BGB has also held strong through recent volatility, making it a popular pick for those seeking a mid-cap token with real-world CEX utility and steady exchange support. SkyArk Chronicles (SAC): Gaming Meets NFT Economy SkyArk Chronicles is an emerging blockchain game that merges role-playing mechanics with NFT integration. Built by a team of Web2 and Web3 veterans, SAC offers immersive gameplay while enabling item ownership through its native token. As GameFi narratives begin to rebound, SkyArk’s ecosystem approach and active development pipeline give it an edge. With community quests and NFT drops scheduled for August, momentum is quickly building . Conclusion : August is shaping up as a crucial month for identifying breakout altcoins before the next market-wide move. From the meme-powered rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Wall Street Pepe to the staking innovation of Haedal, the exchange utility of Bitget Token, and the GameFi vision of SkyArk Chronicles, each token offers a distinct value proposition. MAGACOIN’s $4,500-to-$52,500 potential stands out, but all five are gaining analyst traction as capital shifts into higher-risk, higher-reward positions. With altcoin season heating up, early entry may prove decisive.

2025-08-02 06:00:25,49403071,1754114425,"Bitcoin Drops Below $115K as Traders Rush to Exit, But a Rebound Could Be Next","Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating a period of heightened uncertainty as its price struggles to regain upward momentum following recent declines. Over the past 24 hours, the world’s largest cryptocurrency recorded a dip to $114,326 before slightly recovering above the $115,000 mark. Despite this rebound, the asset remains under pressure, with recent market movements highlighting potential shifts in trader sentiment and long-term holder behavior. Data shared by market analysts indicates that derivatives activity is playing a significant role in current price fluctuations. Insights from the analytics platform CryptoQuant suggest that sudden changes in leveraged positions and aggressive selling pressure on major exchanges are contributing to the ongoing volatility. At the same time, on-chain data shows an increase in activity from long-term Bitcoin holders, suggesting a structural change in the market that may influence future price dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet Leveraged Positions Under Pressure on Major Exchanges According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin’s decline below $115,000 coincided with a notable reduction in open interest on Binance, dropping from $14 billion to under $13.5 billion in a short span. This 4% decline in open interest within a single day is often linked to liquidation events, where leveraged positions are closed automatically due to margin calls. Taha explained that many traders appear to have exited long positions as the price fell, potentially triggering a cascade of sell orders and amplifying market pressure. Net Taker Volume on Binance also turned sharply negative, nearing -$160 million, suggesting an increase in aggressive selling activity. This trend reflects fear-driven reactions among market participants, particularly retail traders, who may have chosen to close or reverse positions amid expectations of further price declines. Despite this wave of selling, Taha noted the possibility of a short-term rebound. A reduction in leveraged long positions combined with an increase in short exposure could create conditions for a market rebalancing or a short squeeze if selling pressure eases in the coming days. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Show Signs of Major Reallocation In addition to short-term derivatives market dynamics, other analysts are pointing to broader structural changes in Bitcoin’s investor base. CryptoQuant analyst OnChainSchool highlighted that in 2024, more than 255,000 BTC previously inactive for over seven years were reactivated. In 2025, this trend has continued, with over 215,000 BTC already moving within the first several months of the year. The average monthly movement of long-dormant coins has risen from 4,900 BTC in 2023 to over 30,000 BTC in 2025. Transaction sizes have also grown significantly, from around 162 BTC to over 1,000 BTC per transfer. According to OnChainSchool, these patterns indicate that large-scale holders, rather than retail investors, are reallocating capital on a scale not seen in previous cycles. The analyst suggested that beyond price fluctuations, these shifts may have long-term implications for market liquidity and Bitcoin’s future ownership distribution.

2025-08-02 05:55:10,49402910,1754114110,Ethereum ETF Outflows: Unpacking the Massive $152 Million Shift,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Outflows: Unpacking the Massive $152 Million Shift The world of cryptocurrency investments is always dynamic, and recent events have once again underscored this volatility. On August 1, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a substantial combined net outflow of $152.26 million. This figure, as highlighted by data shared by Trader T on X, marks the third-highest single-day net outflow since these groundbreaking products were introduced to the market. Such a significant movement naturally captures the attention of investors and market analysts, prompting a closer examination of what exactly transpired and what these Ethereum ETF outflows could signify for the broader digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Specifics: Which Ethereum ETFs Saw Outflows? To fully grasp the scale of these Ethereum ETF outflows , it is essential to look at the individual products that contributed to this considerable sum. While the overall figure is impactful, understanding the distribution across various funds provides a clearer picture of investor behavior and market preferences. The data reveals that several prominent Ethereum ETFs faced significant redemptions on this particular day. ETF Name Net Outflow (Millions USD) Grayscale’s mini ETH $47.68 Bitwise’s ETHW $40.30 Grayscale’s ETHE $37.20 Invesco’s QETH $8.42 Fidelity’s FETH $6.17 Franklin Templeton’s EZET $5.37 VanEck’s ETHV $5.18 ARK 21Shares’ CETH $1.94 This table illustrates that Grayscale’s mini ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW led the redemptions, accounting for a significant portion of the total Ethereum ETF outflows . The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating that the outflows were concentrated among specific products. Why Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows Happening? Decoding the Market Signals. Understanding the catalysts behind such significant Ethereum ETF outflows is crucial for investors and market participants. Several factors could contribute to these movements, often reflecting broader market sentiment or individual investor strategies: Profit-Taking: After periods of positive price performance for Ethereum, some investors might opt to realize their gains. This is a common practice in any investment market, where assets are sold after reaching a desired profit margin, leading to redemptions from ETF holdings. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall mood in the cryptocurrency market plays a significant role. Concerns about macroeconomic conditions, shifts in global financial policies, or even a general downturn in risk appetite can lead investors to reduce their exposure to more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutional investors and even savvy individual investors regularly rebalance their portfolios to maintain specific asset allocations. These Ethereum ETF outflows could be a result of a strategic decision to adjust exposure to digital assets in favor of other asset classes, or vice versa, depending on their investment objectives. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains in flux. Any perceived shift in regulatory stance or new commentary from authorities could trigger caution among investors, leading to a reduction in their holdings. Competition from Direct Holdings: Some investors might choose to hold Ethereum directly on exchanges or through other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, especially if they seek greater control, lower fees, or access to staking rewards not always available through ETFs. The Immediate Impact: How Do Ethereum ETF Outflows Affect the Market? When significant Ethereum ETF outflows occur, they can send ripples through the market. The most immediate effect is often a bearish signal, which can exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price in the short term. This is because fund managers, to meet redemption requests, may need to sell a portion of their underlying Ethereum holdings, thereby increasing selling pressure on the open market. Beyond price action, these outflows can also influence investor confidence. Sustained periods of redemptions might make new investors hesitant to enter the market through these ETF vehicles, perceiving a lack of momentum or underlying weakness. However, it is important to note that the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market is substantial. While $152.26 million is a considerable sum for a single day, the market’s ability to absorb such movements without a drastic price collapse speaks to its growing maturity and depth. Broader Context: Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows a Trend or an Anomaly? While the $152.26 million outflow is significant, ranking as the third-highest, it is essential to place these Ethereum ETF outflows within a broader historical context. Such movements are not entirely unprecedented in the world of exchange-traded funds, particularly in nascent asset classes like cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin ETFs have also experienced periods of substantial outflows, especially during broader market corrections or shifts in investor sentiment. These ebbs and flows are a natural part of capital movement in dynamic financial markets. The very nature of ETFs, designed for liquidity and ease of trading, means that capital can move in and out relatively quickly. Therefore, a single day’s outflow, while notable, does not necessarily dictate a long-term trend. Instead, it often reflects a snapshot of market sentiment and investor reactions to prevailing conditions. Understanding these patterns helps investors maintain perspective and avoid overreacting to short-term events, recognizing that market cycles involve both inflows and outflows. Navigating the Current Climate: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Ethereum ETF Outflows. For investors currently holding or considering investments in spot Ethereum ETFs, these recent Ethereum ETF outflows offer several key considerations and actionable insights: Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets, including those influenced by ETFs, are known for their volatility. Focusing on the long-term potential of the Ethereum ecosystem and its technological advancements, rather than short-term price fluctuations, can be a more effective strategy. Prioritize Diversification: As with any investment, diversification remains a cornerstone of prudent portfolio management. Spreading investments across different asset classes and within the crypto space can help mitigate risks associated with the performance of a single asset or ETF. Implement Robust Risk Management: Investors should only invest capital they can comfortably afford to lose. Defining clear entry and exit strategies, setting stop-loss orders, and regularly reviewing one’s risk tolerance are crucial steps in managing exposure to volatile assets. Stay Informed and Conduct Due Diligence: The cryptocurrency market evolves rapidly. Staying abreast of regulatory news, broader market sentiment, and fundamental developments within the Ethereum network is vital. Informed decisions are always the best decisions. The Road Ahead: What Do These Ethereum ETF Outflows Mean for the Future of Digital Asset Investments? The recent Ethereum ETF outflows underscore the dynamic and maturing nature of the digital asset investment landscape. While significant, these movements are part of a broader process where cryptocurrencies are increasingly integrated into traditional financial products. The approval and launch of spot Ethereum ETFs themselves represented a major milestone, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for a wider audience to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. This institutional embrace is a long-term positive, even if it comes with the typical market behaviors seen in traditional finance, including periods of profit-taking and rebalancing. Looking forward, the long-term success of spot Ethereum ETFs will hinge on their ability to attract sustained inflows over time, proving their utility as mainstream investment vehicles. As the market continues to mature and regulatory clarity improves, these products could play an even larger role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. The journey of mainstream crypto adoption is still unfolding, and moments like these outflows provide valuable data points for its trajectory. Concluding Thoughts: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum ETFs The $152.26 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 1 serves as a crucial data point, highlighting a period of significant investor activity. While substantial, it is essential to view these Ethereum ETF outflows within the broader context of market cycles and evolving investor strategies. These events are not uncommon in nascent markets and can often provide valuable insights into market sentiment and liquidity dynamics. For the burgeoning world of digital asset investments, understanding these flows is key to navigating the path forward and appreciating the complex interplay of factors shaping the future of digital asset investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot Ethereum ETF? A: A spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that directly holds Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making it accessible to a broader range of investors. Q2: Why did U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experience significant outflows on August 1? A: The significant Ethereum ETF outflows on August 1 can be attributed to several factors, including profit-taking by investors after periods of price appreciation, broader negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, strategic portfolio rebalancing by large investors, or reactions to ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset space. Q3: How do these Ethereum ETF outflows impact the price of Ethereum? A: Large Ethereum ETF outflows can exert short-term downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. This is because ETF managers may need to sell a portion of their underlying ETH holdings to meet redemption requests, increasing the supply of ETH on the open market and potentially leading to a price decline. However, the overall impact depends on the market’s liquidity and demand. Q4: Is this a common occurrence for ETFs in general? A: Yes, outflows and inflows are a normal part of ETF operations, especially in volatile or new asset classes. ETFs are designed for liquidity, allowing investors to easily buy and sell shares. Periods of significant outflows can occur due to various market conditions, investor sentiment shifts, or rebalancing strategies, similar to traditional stock or bond ETFs. Q5: What should investors consider in response to these outflows? A: Investors should maintain a long-term perspective, focusing on Ethereum’s fundamental technology and ecosystem growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification across different assets, implementing sound risk management strategies, and staying informed about market trends and regulatory developments are also crucial considerations.

2025-08-02 05:42:07,49423634,1754113327,Here’s Why XRP Doesn’t Need to be Backed by Gold,"Versan Aljarrah, XRP community pundit and host of the Black Swan Capitalist, has explained how he believes XRP could gain exposure to gold. According to Aljarrah, this could happen not through a gold backing but with XRP acting as a bridge for gold-backed tokens on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). His comments follow a wave of community speculation suggesting XRP might eventually be tied to gold, an idea that has faced criticism for lacking technical support.How XRP Could Create a Synthetic Link to GoldIn his latest commentary , Aljarrah clarified that XRP doesn't need to carry a gold backing to benefit from its value. He believes XRP just needs to facilitate the movement of gold-pegged stablecoins on the XRPL. In doing so, XRP would gain a synthetic connection to tokenized assets like gold, oil, and others that enter the blockchain through XRPL. The market pundit sees this role as a way for XRP to cement its future relevance in global finance.Notably, while the XRPL has not welcomed a slew of gold-backed assets, Meld Gold is currently leading the effort. The company is currently looking to introduce a gold-backed stablecoin on the XRPL.https://twitter.com/meldgold/status/1799063771161502000For context, each token represents one gram of physical gold, stored securely by custodians such as MKS Pamp and Imperial Vaults. Meld Gold will allow the token to integrate real-world assets like gold and silver with XRPL's DeFi tools, including its built-in decentralized exchange.So far, Meld Gold is the only project looking to launch on the XRPL. Other gold-backed tokens, like PAX Gold (PAXG), hold strong reputations but haven't launched on XRPL yet. Aljarrah sees a future where there is a flood of such tokens on the XRPL.Persistent Calls for XRP to Bridge Gold-backed Tokens Notably, the Black Swan Capitalist host has persistently promoted the idea of XRP powering a gold-linked financial system. In May, he released a critique of today's monetary structure. Aljarrah argued that tokenizing gold on-chain, particularly on XRPL, could lead to a more transparent and stable financial system. In that setup, XRP would serve as the asset connecting these tokenized gold units.Meanwhile, five months ago, Aljarrah claimed that financial giants such as JP Morgan, BlackRock, the BIS, and the IMF had already made private decisions to place XRP at the center of a future monetary framework. While he suggested that XRP could act as the eventual bridge of this system, he failed to provide any evidence.Theories of XRP Receiving a Gold Backing Lack Technical SupportThese comments come as other community voices have floated theories of a future where XRP sees a gold backing. In February, Edoardo Farina from Alpha Lions Academy speculated that XRP could connect to U.S. gold reserves in Fort Knox. However, he admitted that his idea had no proof and remained purely theoretical.Also, earlier this year, several XRP community members suggested that XRP would be supported by the gold price of around $2,953 at the time. This idea gained traction across social media, but like others before it, it lacked any technical support.Matt Hamilton, former Director of Developer Relations at Ripple, has consistently pushed back against these claims. Starting in 2023, and continuing through 2024 and 2025, he firmly stated that XRP couldn't be backed by gold.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,1,versan aljarrah xrp community pundit host black swan capitalist explained belief xrp could gain exposure gold according aljarrah could happen gold backing xrp acting bridge token xrp ledger xrpl comment follow wave community speculation suggesting xrp might eventually tied gold idea faced criticism lacking technical xrp could create synthetic link goldin latest commentary aljarrah clarified xrp need carry gold backing benefit value belief xrp need facilitate movement stablecoins xrpl xrp would gain synthetic connection tokenized asset like gold oil others enter blockchain xrpl market pundit see role way xrp cement future relevance global xrpl welcomed slew asset meld gold currently leading effort company currently looking introduce stablecoin context token represents one gram physical gold stored securely custodian mks pamp imperial vault meld gold allow token integrate asset like gold silver xrpl defi tool including decentralized far meld gold project looking launch xrpl token like pax gold paxg hold strong reputation launched xrpl yet aljarrah see future flood token call xrp bridge token notably black swan capitalist host persistently promoted idea xrp powering financial system may released critique today monetary structure aljarrah argued tokenizing gold particularly xrpl could lead transparent stable financial system setup xrp would serve asset connecting tokenized gold five month ago aljarrah claimed financial giant jp morgan blackrock bi imf already made private decision place xrp center future monetary framework suggested xrp could act eventual bridge system failed provide xrp receiving gold backing lack technical supportthese comment come community voice floated theory future xrp see gold backing february edoardo farina alpha lion academy speculated xrp could connect gold reserve fort knox however admitted idea proof remained purely earlier year several xrp community member suggested xrp would supported gold price around time idea gained traction across social medium like others lacked technical hamilton former director developer relation ripple consistently pushed back claim starting continuing firmly stated xrp could backed gold,0.031,0.787,0.182,0.9908,1

The prospective investments from the Alphabet subsidiary, CapitalG, and Nvidia could raise VAST Data’s valuation to $30 billion. Alphabet’s venture arm, CapitalG, and the semiconductor giant Nvidia are in advanced discussions to invest in VAST Data, a rapidly growing artificial intelligence infrastructure startup. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, the funding round could value VAST Data at up to $30B, making it one of the highest-valued AI startups globally. VAST Data is on track for a $30B valuation The New York-based company is reportedly raising about $5B from a mix of tech giants, private equity firms, and venture capital investors. While the final structure of the deal is still being negotiated, the round is expected to close within the next few weeks. Alphabet’s CapitalG’s interest marks the company’s entrance into AI infrastructure. Nvidia, on the other hand, would be consolidating its ties within the AI data stack as it is already a backer of VAST Data. VAST Data develops specialized storage solutions for AI data centers, allowing for high-speed data movement between GPUs (graphics processing units), primarily those manufactured by Nvidia. This capability is increasingly crucial as the demand for efficient, scalable AI training environments continues to rise. The startup’s technology has attracted key clients such as Elon Musk’s xAI and CoreWeave. Is VAST gearing up for an IPO? According to a separate source cited by Reuters, VAST Data reached $200M in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in January 2025. With a healthy order backlog, the company is projecting to triple that figure to $600M in ARR over the next year. VAST Data’s CEO, Renen Halak, has said that the company is free cash flow positive, which is rare among AI startups currently, as they have to burn through capital to sustain their rapid growth. Anyhow, the company is drawing speculation of a future public offering. Although it has not hinted at an imminent IPO, insiders have said that VAST Data is laying the groundwork. In 2023, the company appointed Amy Shapero as its first Chief Financial Officer. Shapero served as the CFO at the e-commerce giant Shopify, and her experience in scaling a company through a public listing is fanning the flames of Vast Data’s future fundraising plans. VAST Data has raised approximately $380M to date. Its most recent funding round in 2023 valued it at $9.1B. This surge in valuation is due to the increased interest in infrastructure providers such as chipmakers, cloud computing platforms, and storage specialists.

China’s CAC and US lawmakers raise concerns over tracking, geolocation, and remote shutdown features in advanced chips. Nvidia plans to resume H20 chip sales in China after US approval, balancing regulatory scrutiny from both sides. Nvidia Corporation has stated that its chips do not contain any backdoors that could provide third parties with access to devices, according to CNBC . In July, the company announced its intention to resume sales of H20 AI processors in China after receiving permission from the US government. Chinese regulators summoned representatives of the chipmaker for questioning to understand the potential risks associated with the chips. On July 31, Nvidia met with Beijing officials to discuss national security concerns. “Cybersecurity is of the utmost importance to us. Nvidia chips do not have any ‘backdoors’ that would allow someone to remotely access or control them,” a company spokesperson said in a statement on August 1. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has demanded that Nvidia provide clarifications and relevant documentation regarding security threats, including potential vulnerabilities and backdoors, in H20 chips shipped to the country. The regulator noted previous concerns about serious vulnerabilities in the American company's AI processors and pointed out that American legislators have called for mandatory tracking for the export of advanced semiconductors. CAC added that US AI experts have claimed Nvidia’s computing chips include advanced “tracking and positioning” technologies, as well as “remote shutdown” features. In May, Republican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton and a bipartisan group of eight members of Congress introduced the U.S. Chip Security Act, which would require semiconductor companies like Nvidia to build security mechanisms and geolocation features into their advanced AI processors. Democratic Representative Bill Foster, a co-sponsor of the bill in the House, and independent tech experts told Reuters that chip-tracking technology already exists and is incorporated into Nvidia products.",News|Business,EN,0,nvidia denies backdoor ai chip amid chinese security probe demand documentation china cac u lawmaker raise concern tracking geolocation remote shutdown feature advanced chip nvidia plan resume chip sale china u approval balancing regulatory scrutiny side nvidia corporation stated chip contain backdoor could provide third party access device according cnbc july company announced intention resume sale ai processor china receiving permission u government chinese regulator summoned representative chipmaker questioning understand potential risk associated chip july nvidia met beijing official discus national security concern cybersecurity utmost importance u nvidia chip backdoor would allow someone remotely access control company spokesperson said statement august cyberspace administration china cac demanded nvidia provide clarification relevant documentation regarding security threat including potential vulnerability backdoor chip shipped country regulator noted previous concern serious vulnerability american company ai processor pointed american legislator called mandatory tracking export advanced semiconductor cac added u ai expert claimed nvidia computing chip include advanced tracking positioning technology well remote shutdown feature may republican senator tom cotton bipartisan group eight member congress introduced chip security act would require semiconductor company like nvidia build security mechanism geolocation feature advanced ai processor democratic representative bill foster bill house independent tech expert told reuters technology already exists incorporated nvidia product,0.08,0.761,0.159,0.9423,1

An old Bitcoin wallet, which had been inactive for 12 years, transferred 306 BTC (approximately $35.37 million) today. This ancient investor purchased the BTC in question for a total of $23,700 12 years ago, when Bitcoin was just $77. At today's prices, that investment is worth approximately 1,493 times. However, such profit-taking also creates a sense of caution among investors. Historical data shows that August and September are generally weak months for Bitcoin. In eight of the last 12 years, BTC prices have fallen during these two months. This suggests a 67% probability of a decline.

2025-08-01 19:30:23,49377520,1754076623,"Analyst Predicts Historical 90% XRP Crash Against Bitcoin, But This Will Happen First","XRP’s recent performance has been relatively strong against Bitcoin in the past month. Over the past few weeks, the XRP/BTC pair has been quietly pushing up above the 0.00002100 level and challenging long-standing horizontal resistance levels. Amid this movement, a new technical analysis from crypto analyst JayDee has stirred controversy on social media, with the suggestion that XRP may soon go on an explosive rally against Bitcoin before suffering a catastrophic 90% crash. Final Biblical Move To Send XRP/BTC Surging According to JayDee, XRP is entering the final phase of its multi-year structure against Bitcoin, and a dramatic breakout could be imminent. “$XRP is on the verge of having its FINAL BIBLICAL MOVE against $BTC in the coming months,” he wrote. As shown in a monthly candlestick timeframe chart of the XRP/BTC pair, which the analyst shared on the social media platform X, XRP/BTC is currently sitting around a resistance zone after escaping a long-term descending triangle back in December 2024. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Teleport As Major Financial Players Tap In — Opportunity Window Closing Fast A thick green box shown in the chart below suggests that the next move may be a rapid surge, which could see the XRP/BTC pair trade for as high as 0.00007. At the time of writing, XRP/BTC is trading at 0.00002649. Therefore, an increase to 0.00007 will represent a 164% increase from the current levels and put the pair trading at levels not seen since mid-2019. The green target zone will likely come into play once resistance at 0.00002700 is cleared with enough volume for XRP. A strong factor that could see XRP outperforming Bitcoin by such a massive amount is if Spot XRP ETFs are finally launched in the US. Supporting this view is a bullish crossover forming on the Stochastic RSI, which is circled on the chart. The momentum indicator is currently sitting just above the 60 line, which is another sign that the pair could be on the verge of a sharp move higher. Once this bullish cross is confirmed, the rally would be massive and go along the line of many traders expecting an intense upside in a short period of time. However, the expected price overperformance of XRP against Bitcoin comes with a twist; this euphoric phase won’t last long. The Predicted 90% XRP/BTC Crash Analyst JayDee warns that what comes after this final Biblical XRP/BTC move could be devastating for most XRP holders. “Right before HISTORICAL 90% crash that will wipe out most investors,” he added. Related Reading: XRP Price Showing Quiet Strength As Next Breakout Level Lies At $4.65 The predicted crash is shown in the chart image above with a massive blue arrow pointing downward into a pink zone located between $0.000009 and $0.000007. According to the structure, this drop would return XRP/BTC to retest its long-term ascending support trendline, which has held since 2017. A 90% crash in the XRP/BTC pair could happen if XRP experiences a severe price breakdown below $3 and $2. Alternatively, XRP could underperform and drive the ratio downward even without a sharp XRP price decline if Bitcoin regains dominance and begins setting multiple new all-time highs.

2025-08-01 19:24:34,49377351,1754076274,"Ray Dalio’s Departure from Bridgewater: Legacy, Predictions, and the Future of Crypto","Billionaire Ray Dalio has handed over control of the hedge fund he founded 50 years ago, Bridgewater Associates. According to reports , Dalio sold his last stake in the company and left the board of directors. After that, Bridgewater issued new shares to the sovereign fund of Brunei. As a result of this multibillion-dollar deal, the fund received almost 20% of the company's shares. Libertarian economist Eugene Ronin told to CoinTelegraph we should expect more active use of cryptocurrencies by Bridgewater's new management. In his opinion, such forecasts are meaningless until the company takes concrete actions. The expert emphasized that the company’s decisions should not influence the personal strategies of investors, since the goals of funds and individuals differ. Dalio's departure is the latest step in a long process. He stepped down as CEO in 2017 and resigned as chairman at the end of 2021. Dalio on Leaving He said he was pleased about this transition and shared the principles that have ensured the company’s 50 years of success. Dalio compared the transition to raising a younger generation. According to him, seeing Bridgewater “alive and well” without his involvement is like watching strong and independent children. The financier noted that the company is now run by people who are 25 to 50 years younger than him. Dalio named the choice of people and culture as his main working principles. He advised creating an “ideocracy” where the main goals are meaningful work and relationships built on “radical truth and transparency.” Another principle is to create a culture where it is okay to make mistakes, but it is unacceptable not to learn from them. He formulated this as an equation: Pain + Reflection = Progress. Dalio now plans to focus on other projects, including sharing his principles with others, investing, family, and ocean exploration through his media project OceanXplorers. Dalio's Predictions The investor, famous for his accurate forecast of the 2008 crisis, expects more turmoil ahead. In his opinion, the world will face a global debt crisis in late 2025, and the US economy will suffer a “heart attack” if the government does not reduce the budget deficit. In light of these forecasts, Dalio recommended that investors allocate up to 15% of their portfolios to bitcoin and gold to hedge risks. Previously, he had advised limiting such allocations to 2%. In 2021, Dalio called Bitcoin “a brilliant invention.” He admitted that he owns some cryptocurrency but prefers gold. Some of Dalio’s predictions have proved inaccurate. In 1982, he expected a global economic depression that did not materialize. This misjudgment led to Bridgewater suffering major losses. Dalio later admitted that this assessment almost caused the company’s bankruptcy. Outlook on Bridgewater’s Future With Dalio’s departure, market observers are closely watching how Bridgewater’s strategy might evolve under new leadership. Many anticipate increased experimentation in the firm’s investment approach, potentially including a greater focus on digital assets and technology-driven strategies. As the financial landscape grows more complex, the ability of Bridgewater’s younger management team to adapt will be a key factor in sustaining the firm’s legacy and performance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,billionaire ray dalio handed control hedge fund founded year ago bridgewater associate according report dalio sold last stake company left board director bridgewater issued new share sovereign fund brunei result deal fund received almost company share libertarian economist eugene ronin told cointelegraph expect active use cryptocurrencies bridgewater new management opinion forecast meaningless company take concrete action expert emphasized company decision influence personal strategy investor since goal fund individual differ dalio departure latest step long process stepped ceo resigned chairman end dalio leaving said pleased transition shared principle ensured company year success dalio compared transition raising younger generation according seeing bridgewater alive well without involvement like watching strong independent child financier noted company run people year younger dalio named choice people culture main working principle advised creating ideocracy main goal meaningful work relationship built radical truth another principle create culture okay make mistake unacceptable learn formulated equation pain reflection progress dalio plan focus project including sharing principle others investing family ocean exploration medium project oceanxplorers dalio prediction investor famous accurate forecast crisis expects turmoil ahead opinion world face global debt crisis late u economy suffer heart attack government reduce budget deficit light forecast dalio recommended investor allocate portfolio bitcoin gold hedge risk previously advised limiting allocation dalio called bitcoin brilliant admitted owns cryptocurrency prefers gold dalio prediction proved inaccurate expected global economic depression materialize misjudgment led bridgewater suffering major loss dalio later admitted assessment almost caused company bankruptcy outlook bridgewater future dalio departure market observer closely watching bridgewater strategy might evolve new leadership many anticipate increased experimentation firm investment approach potentially including greater focus digital asset strategy financial landscape grows complex ability bridgewater younger management team adapt key factor sustaining firm legacy performance,0.156,0.669,0.175,-0.3421,0

Analysts watch $0.62 support and $0.85 resistance as ADA shows signs of an accumulation phase. Volume spikes, RSI divergence, and ecosystem growth fuel bullish sentiment despite the recent 8% decline. Cardano Mirrors Previous Market Cycle Cardano (ADA) is showing a price pattern similar to its last market cycle, according to analyst Ali Martinez. The token is positioning itself close to the Fib level 0.382 at approximately $0.623 and is at resistance on the way up towards $0.85. Martinez notes that ADA appears to be in the same phase as the 2019–2020 cycle, which later led to a strong rally.

Price Performance and Market Position Cardano was trading at $0.72 at press time, with a 24-hour trading volume of about $1.59 billion. The token fell 8% in the past 24 hours and 9% over the past week. Its 24-hour range was $0.7154 to $0.7875, and the 7-day range was $0.7216 to $0.8536. ADA remains well below its all-time high of $3.09, reached on September 2, 2021, representing a 76.6% drawdown. Glassnode data shows that Cardano has experienced multiple long drawdowns before recovering, following a pattern of extended consolidation periods preceding rallies.

2025-08-01 19:15:10,49376922,1754075710,Crypto ETFs: Unprecedented $12.8 Billion Inflows Ignite Market Surge,"BitcoinWorld Crypto ETFs: Unprecedented $12.8 Billion Inflows Ignite Market Surge The world of digital assets just hit a monumental milestone, sending ripples of excitement across global financial markets. July witnessed an unprecedented surge in investment into Crypto ETFs , with a staggering $12.8 billion flowing into U.S.-listed products. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of finance and the growing confidence in digital currencies. For many, Crypto ETFs offer a gateway to the volatile yet lucrative cryptocurrency market, combining the innovative spirit of digital assets with the familiarity of traditional investment vehicles. This record-breaking inflow underscores a pivotal moment, signaling mainstream adoption and a robust appetite for crypto exposure among both institutional and retail investors. What’s Driving the Phenomenal Surge in Crypto ETFs? The figures speak for themselves. U.S.-listed Crypto ETFs experienced a record $12.8 billion in inflows during July, a period where the broader market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, climbed over 21%. This remarkable performance is largely attributed to increasing institutional interest and a maturing market infrastructure. A standout performer in this wave of investment is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT’s asset accumulation has been nothing short of extraordinary, now holding over $86 billion. This impressive figure places IBIT among the top-tier ETFs globally, surpassing long-established giants like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) in terms of asset growth rate, according to data reported by CoinDesk. This rapid ascent of IBIT highlights a significant shift in investor preference and confidence towards regulated crypto investment products. The sheer scale of these inflows suggests that traditional financial players are not just dabbling in crypto; they are committing substantial capital, viewing Crypto ETFs as a legitimate and integral part of diversified investment portfolios.

AUM (July Data) Primary Asset Focus iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) $86 Billion+ Bitcoin Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) $25 Billion+ Bitcoin Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) $10 Billion+ Bitcoin Table: Illustrative Crypto ETF AUM Comparison Crypto ETFs: Unprecedented $12.8 Billion Inflows Ignite Market Surge Why Are Investors Flocking to Crypto ETFs? The appeal of Crypto ETFs stems from several key advantages they offer over direct cryptocurrency ownership. For many investors, particularly those accustomed to traditional financial markets, ETFs provide a familiar and accessible entry point into the digital asset space. There’s no need to grapple with complex crypto wallets, private keys, or the intricacies of decentralized exchanges. The ease of investment is a major draw. Here are some of the primary reasons investors are increasingly choosing Crypto ETFs : Simplified Access: Investing in Crypto ETFs is as straightforward as buying shares in any traditional stock or fund through a standard brokerage account. This removes significant technical barriers for new entrants. Regulatory Oversight: U.S.-listed Crypto ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of investor protection and legitimacy that direct crypto holdings might not always provide. This appeals to risk-averse investors and large institutions. Professional Management and Custody: These ETFs are managed by established financial institutions that handle the complexities of cryptocurrency custody, security, and rebalancing. This mitigates many of the operational risks associated with holding digital assets directly. Diversification Potential: Some Crypto ETFs offer exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies or specific sectors within the crypto market, providing diversification without the need to individually select and manage multiple digital assets. Liquidity: Being traded on major stock exchanges, Crypto ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. These factors collectively contribute to the growing popularity and trust in Crypto ETFs as a viable investment vehicle for gaining exposure to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Are There Challenges or Risks with Crypto ETFs? While the allure of Crypto ETFs is undeniable, it is crucial for investors to understand that these products are not without their own set of challenges and risks. Like any investment, particularly those tied to nascent and rapidly evolving markets, due diligence is paramount. Despite their regulated nature, Crypto ETFs inherit many of the volatilities inherent in the underlying digital assets. Key considerations and risks associated with Crypto ETFs include: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its significant price swings. Even though Crypto ETFs offer a regulated wrapper, they are still directly exposed to this volatility, meaning their value can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. Tracking Error: While ETFs aim to track the performance of their underlying assets, minor discrepancies, known as tracking errors, can occur due to various factors like management fees, operational costs, and market inefficiencies. Management Fees: Like all ETFs, Crypto ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) that can eat into returns over time. Investors should carefully review these fees before investing. Regulatory Evolution: Although current Crypto ETFs are regulated, the broader cryptocurrency regulatory landscape is still evolving. Future regulatory changes could impact the operation or even the viability of certain crypto products. Custody and Security Concerns: While professional custodians manage the underlying crypto assets, the risk of hacks or security breaches, though rare with established custodians, is always a theoretical concern in the digital asset space. Investors rely on the ETF provider’s security measures. Limited Scope: Currently, most major Crypto ETFs in the U.S. track Bitcoin. While there is growing interest in Ethereum and other altcoin ETFs, the options for broad diversification within a single ETF are still somewhat limited compared to traditional asset classes. Understanding these potential drawbacks is essential for making informed investment decisions and managing expectations when incorporating Crypto ETFs into a portfolio. How Do Leading Crypto ETFs Compare and What Does it Mean? The emergence of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a dominant force in the Crypto ETFs landscape is a significant development. Its rapid accumulation of over $86 billion in assets under management (AUM) is a testament to the trust and capital that institutional investors, in particular, are now placing in the Bitcoin market through regulated channels. This success is not isolated; other Bitcoin ETFs from major players like Fidelity (FBTC) and ARK Invest/21Shares (ARKB) have also seen substantial inflows, collectively contributing to the record-breaking figures. The comparison with established ETFs like IVV (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF) and IWM (iShares Russell 2000 ETF) is particularly insightful. While IBIT has not yet surpassed their total AUM, its growth rate in such a short period is unparalleled. This indicates a powerful shift in capital allocation, where a growing portion of investment portfolios is being directed towards digital assets via these accessible and regulated instruments. The backing of financial giants like BlackRock, with their extensive experience and robust infrastructure, lends considerable credibility to the Crypto ETFs market. This institutional validation helps to alleviate concerns about market integrity and security, drawing in a broader spectrum of investors who might have previously been hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. The sheer volume of inflows into these products suggests that Bitcoin, and potentially other major cryptocurrencies, are increasingly being viewed as legitimate assets within mainstream finance, rather than niche speculative instruments. What Actionable Insights Can Investors Glean from Crypto ETF Inflows? The monumental inflows into Crypto ETFs are not just headline-grabbing figures; they offer crucial insights for both seasoned investors and newcomers to the digital asset space. Understanding these trends can help inform investment strategies and provide a clearer picture of the market’s direction. Here are some actionable insights derived from the recent surge in Crypto ETF investments: Mainstream Validation: The record inflows signal a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This institutional adoption could lead to greater market stability and liquidity over the long term. Investors should recognize that digital assets are becoming an increasingly integrated part of the global financial system. Accessibility Matters: The success of Crypto ETFs underscores the demand for easier, more regulated ways to access crypto exposure. For those wary of direct crypto purchases, ETFs offer a convenient alternative. Consider if an ETF aligns better with your risk tolerance and technical comfort level. Diversification Potential: As more varied Crypto ETFs emerge (beyond just Bitcoin), they could offer broader diversification within a portfolio, allowing exposure to different segments of the digital asset market without the need to manage multiple individual cryptocurrencies. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market movements will always occur, the consistent inflow into Crypto ETFs suggests a growing long-term conviction among investors. This trend encourages a strategic, rather than purely speculative, approach to crypto investments. Due Diligence is Key: Despite the positive sentiment, it is vital to research any Crypto ETF thoroughly before investing. Understand its underlying assets, expense ratio, tracking methodology, and the reputation of the fund provider. Do not solely rely on headline figures. Stay Informed: The crypto market and its regulatory environment are dynamic. Continuous learning and staying updated on developments in the Crypto ETFs space will be crucial for making informed decisions. These insights suggest that Crypto ETFs are not just a passing fad but a significant evolution in how investors interact with the digital asset economy, opening new avenues for portfolio growth and diversification. The record $12.8 billion inflow into Crypto ETFs in July marks a watershed moment for the digital asset ecosystem. It is a powerful affirmation of growing investor confidence, driven by increasing regulatory clarity, the robust infrastructure provided by traditional financial giants, and the inherent appeal of accessible exposure to cryptocurrencies. BlackRock’s IBIT, in particular, has emerged as a testament to this shift, demonstrating that institutional capital is not just dipping its toes but diving deep into the crypto waters through regulated channels. While challenges and risks remain, the trajectory is clear: Crypto ETFs are solidifying their position as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. This ongoing integration promises to reshape investment portfolios and bring cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream, ushering in an exciting new era for global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Crypto ETF? A Crypto ETF , or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund that tracks the price of one or more cryptocurrencies. It allows investors to gain exposure to digital assets through traditional brokerage accounts without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrency. These funds trade on stock exchanges, much like stocks or traditional ETFs. Why are Crypto ETFs becoming so popular? Their popularity stems from several factors: ease of access for traditional investors, regulatory oversight that provides a sense of security, professional management of crypto assets (including secure custody), and the ability to diversify a portfolio without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Are Crypto ETFs a safe investment? While Crypto ETFs offer a regulated and professionally managed way to invest in cryptocurrencies, they are still subject to the inherent volatility of the underlying digital asset market. They are not entirely risk-free, and their value can fluctuate significantly. Investors should assess their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research. How do I invest in Crypto ETFs? You can invest in Crypto ETFs through a standard brokerage account, similar to how you would buy stocks or other ETFs. You will need to open an account with a brokerage firm that offers these products and then place an order for the desired ETF. What’s the difference between a Bitcoin ETF and other Crypto ETFs? A Bitcoin ETF specifically tracks the price of Bitcoin, making it the sole underlying asset. Other Crypto ETFs might track a basket of different cryptocurrencies (a multi-coin ETF) or focus on specific sectors within the crypto ecosystem, offering broader or more targeted exposure beyond just Bitcoin. How do institutional investors impact Crypto ETFs? Institutional investors, such as large asset managers and hedge funds, bring substantial capital and credibility to the Crypto ETF market. Their participation, as seen with BlackRock’s IBIT, validates the asset class and can contribute to increased liquidity, market stability, and further mainstream adoption.

After a 20% drop from its mid-July high, XRP appears to have found solid footing around the $2.90 level, forming a double bottom — a classic reversal signal that suggests renewed buying interest. However, broader macro conditions could add pressure. The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged in July, taking a wait-and-see approach amid new tariffs, while recent jobs data came in weaker than expected, adding uncertainty to the market outlook. With the April “reciprocal” tariff pause ending today and 92 countries now facing higher levies, speculators see little chance of a September rate cut, further dulling risk appetite. President Trump issued sweeping new tariffs on nearly all traders via executive orders, effective August 7, covering 92 countries. Tariff rates range from 10% to 41%, targeting non-deal partners (e.g., Canada 35%, India 25%, Taiwan 20%). These “reciprocal tariffs” follow the… pic.twitter.com/bdKTfJeINR — Presidential Summary (@presidentialsum) August 1, 2025 XRP Bull Run Hinges on Double Bottom Pattern According to popular X analyst Ali Charts, a potential double bottom could see the XRP price return to $3.60, around the level that had capped its recent bull run. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 His analysis notes a key resistance at $3.30, the neckline of the double bottom, and the key threshold for a confirmed breakout towards its target. However, the market is hesitant. Open interest is showing signs of decline, falling 25% over the past 10 days, according to CoinGlass data —speculative interest is falling with traders wagering less on XRP price moves.

Active derivative traders do appear to be positioning for a continuation, though, with a long/short ratio of 2.59 on Binance showing over 72% of traders are still betting on price increases. XRP Price Analysis: Is This the Setup for a New All-Time High? The double bottom highlighted by Ali could set XRP back on the breakout path of its 9-month falling wedge pattern. XRP / USDT 4-hour chart, double bottom feeds falling wedge breakout. Source: TradingView, Binance. While post-breakout momentum stalled with the mid-June market top, a reversal here could refocus attention on its $4.10 target—a potential 40% move to new all-time highs. Momentum indicators support this outlook. The RSI has rebounded from oversold at 30, now sitting at 37, suggesting buyers are stepping in as sellers reach exhaustion. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is beginning to flatten after a death cross, often an early signal of an uptrend on the 4-hour chart as it moves back toward the signal line. If $2.90 holds, the double bottom will need to break through its neckline at $3.30 to confirm upside toward $3.60 and beyond. However, if $2.90 fails and macro conditions take control over investor sentiment, the XRP price could tumble to deeper support around $2.70. Macro FUD Could Make Gains Harder To Find – This Tool Can Help As “reciprocal” tariffs return, markets are fearing a repeat of the mid-2025 bear market—long-term holders might have to play the waiting game again. Traders might find more success with short-term speculative plays, low-cap coins making the rounds like Ana are posting up to 1,000%+ gains in a single day. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in.

2025-08-01 19:10:10,49376718,1754075410,Economic Data Integrity: Trump’s Shocking Order Sparks Jobs Report Controversy,"BitcoinWorld Economic Data Integrity: Trump’s Shocking Order Sparks Jobs Report Controversy In the dynamic world of finance, from traditional stocks to the volatile realm of cryptocurrencies, one constant truth prevails: market confidence hinges significantly on the perceived reliability of official economic indicators. When the spotlight turns to the very foundation of these indicators – economic data integrity – it sends ripples across all sectors. Recently, a significant political development has ignited widespread discussion, raising questions about the accuracy and impartiality of crucial government statistics, particularly concerning jobs reports. What’s the Latest on Economic Data Integrity? The news, as reported by Whale Wire CEO Jacob King on X, points to a startling directive from former President Donald Trump. According to King, Trump has allegedly ordered the dismissal of Labor Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The reason? A “shockingly low” jobs report that, crucially, saw a significant downward revision of job gains. This incident immediately thrusts the concept of economic data integrity into the forefront of national discourse. The core of the controversy centers on two main points: The initial publication of a jobs report deemed “shockingly low” by Trump. A subsequent revision that reduced reported job gains by a substantial 258,000. Accusations from Trump that the Commissioner previously manipulated data to undermine his presidential campaign. Such accusations, if substantiated, have profound implications not just for political narratives but for the fundamental trust in the institutions responsible for compiling and disseminating vital economic information. The Jobs Report Controversy: Why Revisions Spark Debate Jobs reports are among the most closely watched economic indicators, offering a snapshot of the labor market’s health. They influence everything from Federal Reserve interest rate decisions to investor sentiment. Revisions to these reports are not uncommon; initial estimates are often refined as more comprehensive data becomes available. However, the scale of this particular revision, coupled with the political context, has amplified concerns about economic data integrity . Let’s consider the impact of such revisions: Aspect Initial Report Revised Report Job Gains (Reported) Higher Initial Estimate 258,000 Lower Market Perception More Optimistic Less Optimistic Economic Outlook Stronger Growth Indicated Slower Growth Indicated While routine, a revision of this magnitude, especially when accompanied by accusations of political motivation, inevitably raises questions about the robustness of the initial data collection and analysis processes. This directly challenges public confidence in economic data integrity . Accusations of Manipulation: A Threat to Trust in Economic Data Integrity? Trump’s accusation goes beyond just the recent revision. He claims that Commissioner McEntarfer previously manipulated data specifically to damage his presidential campaign. This suggests a pattern of alleged misconduct, if true, that extends beyond a single report. Such claims, whether proven or not, can erode public trust in government institutions and the information they provide. The implications of such accusations are far-reaching: Erosion of Public Trust: If citizens believe economic data is manipulated for political gain, it undermines faith in government transparency and accountability. Market Volatility: Uncertainty about the true state of the economy can lead to increased market volatility as investors struggle to make informed decisions. Policy Challenges: Policymakers rely on accurate data to formulate effective strategies. Doubts about data accuracy can lead to misguided economic policies. Impact on Investment Decisions: Businesses and individuals make investment choices based on economic outlooks. Compromised data makes these decisions riskier. The ongoing debate highlights the critical importance of maintaining impeccable economic data integrity for a stable and predictable economic environment. Why Does Economic Data Integrity Matter for Crypto Investors? While this incident appears rooted in traditional politics and economics, its implications resonate within the cryptocurrency world. Crypto markets, despite their decentralized nature, are not immune to broader economic sentiment and global market trends. Here’s why economic data integrity is relevant: Investor Confidence: When confidence in traditional economic data wavers, it can lead to a flight to safety or, conversely, a search for alternative assets. Some investors might view cryptocurrencies as a hedge against perceived manipulation or instability in traditional systems. Monetary Policy Impact: Central banks use jobs reports and other economic data to guide monetary policy. If these reports are questioned, central bank decisions might be perceived as less reliable, potentially impacting inflation expectations and, by extension, the appeal of deflationary assets like Bitcoin. Market Narrative: A narrative of distrust in official statistics can fuel interest in decentralized, transparent systems, which is a core tenet of many cryptocurrencies. Capital Flows: Global capital flows are influenced by perceptions of economic stability and growth. If a major economy’s data is seen as unreliable, it could affect foreign investment and overall market liquidity, which can indirectly impact crypto valuations. Ultimately, a healthy global economy, built on reliable data, provides a more stable backdrop for all asset classes, including the burgeoning digital asset space. Questions about economic data integrity introduce an element of uncertainty that no market welcomes. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for the Informed Investor In an environment where the reliability of official economic data is being questioned, how can investors, particularly those in the crypto space, navigate the waters? Maintaining a clear perspective and making informed decisions is paramount. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional and digital assets, can help mitigate risks associated with specific market shocks or data controversies. Stay Informed, Critically: Follow news from multiple reputable sources. Understand that initial reports can be revised and that political rhetoric often accompanies economic discussions. Distinguish between verified facts and accusations. Focus on Long-Term Trends: While short-term news cycles can create volatility, fundamental long-term trends in technology adoption, global economic shifts, and industry growth often provide a more reliable compass for investment decisions. Understand the Macro Landscape: Recognize that individual economic reports are part of a larger picture. Look at multiple indicators and global events to form a comprehensive view of the economy. Practice Due Diligence: For crypto investments, this means thoroughly researching projects, understanding their utility, and assessing their long-term viability, rather than reacting impulsively to every market tremor. The incident surrounding the jobs report and the Labor Commissioner serves as a stark reminder of the continuous need for vigilance and a deep understanding of the forces shaping our financial world, reinforcing the need for economic data integrity . The alleged directive from Donald Trump to dismiss Labor Commissioner Erika McEntarfer over a revised jobs report has undeniably sparked a significant debate about the transparency and reliability of government-issued economic statistics. While the full implications of these accusations are still unfolding, the incident underscores a fundamental principle: the bedrock of a stable economy and confident markets is unassailable economic data integrity . For investors across all asset classes, including the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, trust in the data that shapes policy and market sentiment is paramount. As this story develops, it will be crucial to observe how these claims are addressed and what measures, if any, are taken to reinforce public confidence in the accuracy of economic reporting. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main controversy regarding the Labor Commissioner? A1: The controversy stems from former President Donald Trump’s alleged order to fire Labor Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a “shockingly low” jobs report that was later revised downward by 258,000 jobs. Trump also accused her of manipulating data in the past to harm his presidential campaign. Q2: Why are jobs reports so important for the economy? A2: Jobs reports are crucial economic indicators that provide insights into the health of the labor market. They influence monetary policy decisions by central banks, affect investor confidence, and help businesses and individuals make financial plans. Their accuracy is vital for sound economic decision-making. Q3: How does this incident relate to “economic data integrity”? A3: This incident directly challenges “economic data integrity” by raising questions about the impartiality and accuracy of official government statistics. Accusations of data manipulation, whether proven or not, can erode public trust in the reliability of information used to gauge economic performance. Q4: Can controversies over economic data affect cryptocurrency markets? A4: Yes, indirectly. While crypto markets are decentralized, they are influenced by broader economic sentiment. Doubts about traditional economic data can impact investor confidence, lead to shifts in capital flows, and fuel narratives around decentralized alternatives, all of which can affect crypto valuations. Q5: Are revisions to economic data reports common? A5: Yes, revisions to economic data, including jobs reports, are common as more comprehensive information becomes available. However, the magnitude of a revision, especially when coupled with political accusations of manipulation, can draw significant scrutiny and raise concerns about the underlying data quality.

2025-08-01 19:07:39,49376609,1754075259,"Weekly Crypto Regulation Roundup: SEC Advances ETF Reform, White House Unveils Crypto Roadmap","This week marked a turning point in U.S. crypto regulation, as both Congress and regulatory agencies moved forward with frameworks that could finally bring clarity to the digital asset space. With the SEC unveiling sweeping ETF reform and the White House publishing its long-awaited crypto policy report, America is sending a clear message: the U.S. wants to lead the next chapter of digital finance. Trump’s Crypto Regulation Roadmap Looks to Cement U.S. Leadership On July 30, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released a 166-page report outlining the Trump administration’s blueprint for transforming the U.S. into the “Crypto Capital of the World.” The document, which embraces terms like “Golden Age of Crypto,” proposes legislative and regulatory clarity as the foundation for future growth. Trump admin report calls for clear SEC/CFTC crypto rules, DeFi adoption & modern bank reforms. #Trump #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/qLYj3tAhZ2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Key recommendations include giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) explicit authority over spot markets for non-security digital assets and formally integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) into traditional market infrastructure. The report also calls for Congress to affirm the right of people to custody their own digital assets and transact peer-to-peer without financial intermediaries. Additionally, the report reflects a political strategy as well. With Trump enjoying a 72% approval rating among crypto holders—according to internal polling cited in the report—there’s no doubt that crypto policy is becoming a serious campaign platform. Industry leaders have responded positively. Rebecca Liao, co-founder, and CEO of Web3 protocol Saga, commented: “By today’s standards, this policy document is not controversial and reflects crypto consensus. Because the recommendations are more reasonable, they should be easier to implement than the extreme ideas often floated on Crypto Twitter.” “Even diehard crypto maxis now accept that unchecked manipulation has eroded trust. For this market to grow sustainably, that issue can’t be ignored much longer,” said Liao. Congressional Pressure Mounts to Pass Crypto Market Structure Legislation Following the report’s release, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill issued a statement urging the Senate to act swiftly. With the GENIUS Act already the law and the CLARITY Act receiving overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, Hill is pushing for crypto market structure legislation to reach President Trump’s desk. “I’m pleased to see the Working Group’s strong support of the CLARITY Act,” said Hill. “Now the Senate must expeditiously work to deliver critical legislation that realigns our regulatory landscape with the President’s vision.” SEC Unveils Project Crypto and Advances ETF Reform In tandem with the White House roadmap, the SEC launched “Project Crypto,” a sweeping initiative designed to modernize securities laws to accommodate blockchain-based financial products. Chairman Paul Atkins announced the initiative during a speech at the America First Policy Institute, stating that the time had come to bring crypto asset issuance and trading back to U.S. soil. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins launches 'Project Crypto' initiative to make America the 'crypto capital of the world' through comprehensive regulatory modernization. #SEC #Crypto #America https://t.co/7dVUQ2rEZ8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 Perhaps most impactful is the SEC’s new Generic Listing Standards for crypto exchange-traded products. These rules, published via the CBOE, outline that any crypto asset with active futures markets for at least six months would automatically qualify for ETF listing. Analysts believe up to a dozen tokens could be approved by October, opening the door to a more inclusive and transparent crypto investment market. SEC establishes new crypto ETF listing standards enabling approximately dozen major digital assets to gain approval by October through streamlined framework. #SEC #ETFs https://t.co/grlJtGb5tH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 A New Era for Regulated Crypto Investing? The week’s developments in crypto regulation suggest that after years of fragmented regulation and uncertainty, a new era may be dawning for U.S.-based crypto investors. Policies are becoming more predictable, access is being broadened, and lawmakers are working in parallel with regulators to build lasting infrastructure. Laurent Kssis, CEO of CEC Capital and a seasoned crypto ETP expert, welcomed the FCA’s recent decision to allow UK retail investors access to crypto ETNs as a sign that matures regulatory environments are finally gaining momentum. The UK FCA will allow retail investors to access crypto ETNs starting Oct 8—reversing a 4+ year ban. #FCA #ETNs https://t.co/aK2NkOS0Md — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 As we enter the second half of 2025, the tone is clear: crypto is no longer a fringe asset class.

2025-08-01 19:07:09,49376610,1754075229,Donald Trump Announced He Will Fire the Head of the Statistics Bureau for “Publishing Bad Data” – Bitcoin Reacted,"US President Donald Trump announced that he has ordered the immediate dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Director Erika McEntarfer following the release of weak employment data in July. In a post on Truth Social, Trump accused McEntarfer of politicizing employment data, calling her a “Biden political appointee.” No concrete evidence was presented for these accusations. Bitcoin price experienced another sudden drop following the development: Chart with minute candles showing the decline in BTC price. “I have instructed my team to immediately remove this Biden political appointee. He will be replaced by someone far more competent and qualified. Such crucial data must be fair and accurate and cannot be manipulated for political purposes,” he said. According to a BLS report released today, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 73,000 in July. Furthermore, data for the previous two months was revised downward by a total of approximately 260,000. The average employment gain for the past three months was only 35,000, marking the weakest performance of the post-pandemic era. Related News: After Employment Data, Senior Fed Official Bostic Talks About Rate Cuts - What Does He Expect? McEntarfer was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2023 and took office after receiving Senate confirmation at the beginning of 2024. The BLS has not yet released a statement on the matter. Employment data is generated through a three-month survey process. However, the initial company response rate has recently fallen below 60%. Before the pandemic, this rate was typically above 70%. Furthermore, the BLS issues major annual revisions each February, based on more robust but delayed data. The annual preliminary estimate released for 2024 was one of the largest revisions since 2009.

2025-08-01 19:04:52,49377817,1754075092,"Crypto wrap: ETH, XRP, SOL shed gains as Bitcoin drops below $115k","The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn on August 1, 2025, as Bitcoin fell below the critical $115,000 support level, triggering a broader sell-off. As a crypto bloodbath ensued amid widespread panic selling top altcoins followed suit. Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) all shed recent gains, with the spillover effect plunging small caps by double-digits or more. The global crypto market capitalization dropped by 3.5% over the past 24 hours to cut the market to $3.7 trillion. Meanwhile, crypto liquidations rose to over $850 million and open interest fell to $189 billion. Why did crypto crash today? The crypto market’s 3.43% decline over the past 24 hours mirrors losses in the Nasdaq and broader macroeconomic jitters. BTC failed to rally after a Fed rate decision helped bulls bounce off lows. As such, a risk-off sentiment looks to have taken hold as traders. Other factors include weak U.S. jobs data, escalating fears of new tariffs. Geopolitical tensions also spooked traders. The liquidation of leveraged long positions also eroded investor confidence, prompting a cascade of profit-taking deals. Bitcoin dips below $115k Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, slipped below the $115,000 threshold. This saw BTC touch lows of $114,061, with analysts saying traders might have to watch a bounce off $112k for signals of short-term stability. According to CryptoQuant’s realized profit and loss chart, the current dip aligns with historical patterns of profit-taking. Julio Moreno’s analysis suggests this could lead to a consolidation period before the next upward push. The outlook for Bitcoin, as highlighted by Julio Moreno of CryptoQuant, could precede further corrections before the next upward trend. Glassnode’s recent data also indicates a surge in realized losses, pointing to the market’s fragility amid these macroeconomic pressures. Crypto analyst Lark Davis sees a similar trend, but says August in post-halving years has been bullish for BTC. ETH, XRP, SOL retreat to key levels Major altcoins followed Bitcoin’s downward trajectory, with Ethereum, Solana, and XRP retreating to critical support levels. Ethereum (ETH) dropped below $3,600, erasing gains from its recent rally. Meanwhile, Ripple’s XRP dropped below $3.00 before recovering to hover at the key level. Solana moved away from the psychological target of $200 as SOL fell to below $170. Most of the top altcoins shed between 3% and 7%, with BNB bucking the trend as analysts say it continued to outperform peers.

2025-08-01 19:03:08,49376453,1754074988,"After Employment Data, Senior Fed Official Bostic Talks About Rate Cuts – What Does He Expect?","Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC that July employment data suggests risks in the labor market may be increasing. However, Bostic said it's too early to change the economic outlook despite the data. “Today's data and the revisions suggest the economy and labor market may be weakening more broadly than what we're seeing in the Atlanta Fed area,” Bostic said. Still, he maintained that this week's interest rate decision was the right one, adding, “This data wouldn't have changed our decision.” Downward revisions to July's data revealed that employment growth has lost momentum. Bostic said, “The data suggests the labor market is slowing, but it remains strong in many respects.” He noted that he hasn't received any significant signals from companies about layoffs, adding that unemployment concerns are not yet prevalent at this stage. Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Donald Trump's Nuclear Threat Hits Cryptocurrencies - Here's the Latest Data Bostic said, “Going into this week, I thought the inflation risk was greater than the employment risk. However, today, I see these two risks becoming more balanced.” Recalling the delicate balance between the Fed's dual goals of employment and price stability, Bostic stated that risks on both sides must be carefully monitored. Bostic, who also commented on trade tariffs, said that customs duties could have a longer-lasting impact on consumer psychology. “Customs duties don't work as described in the textbooks,” he said, emphasizing the complexity of this process. Bostic, who maintains his forecast for a 2025 interest rate cut based on current data, said, “We need to reassess our views as new data becomes available.” He also noted that there is an active debate about how restrictive the Fed's policies currently are. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-01 19:00:43,49376409,1754074843,XRP ETF Decision Could Happen Within 21 Days. Here’s Why,"A significant breakthrough in the U.S. crypto ETF landscape could be just days away. According to a recent update from SMQKE on X, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may issue a decision on a new ETF listing framework within 21 days, a development that could directly impact the approval timeline for spot XRP ETFs. This follows new proposals by both the Cboe BZX Exchange and NYSE Arca, which aim to simplify the listing process for crypto-based exchange-traded funds. If approved, these changes would eliminate the need for individual 19b-4 filings for each crypto ETF, a move that could drastically reduce both the time and cost required to bring these products to market. What the Proposed Framework Changes Currently, crypto ETF issuers must file a 19b-4 form for each product, triggering a lengthy SEC review period that can stretch up to 240 days. The newly proposed framework by Cboe and NYSE Arca would allow qualified crypto ETFs to list under generic standards, streamlining the process. XRP ETF DECISION COULD COME WITHIN 21 DAYS AS SEC REVIEWS NEW LISTING FRAMEWORK Heard it here first. Documented. pic.twitter.com/6WQKJ5UQW1 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 1, 2025 These standards would initially cover crypto assets with an established futures trading history, specifically, at least six months of trading on a regulated U.S. derivatives platform like Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. XRP, along with assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), meets this threshold, positioning it as a strong candidate once the framework is adopted. Though the current proposals don’t yet specify liquidity or market cap thresholds, both exchanges have indicated plans to introduce these standards later. A Faster Timeline for Approval If the SEC approves the new listing framework, eligible crypto ETFs could bypass the drawn-out 19b-4 process. This would allow issuers to launch ETFs much faster, potentially within 75 days rather than waiting up to eight months. In the short term, the SEC’s earliest decision on this rule change could come within 21 days from the publication of the proposals in the Federal Register. That timeline aligns with the standard comment and review period for such filings, according to SEC procedures . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Changing Regulatory Climate The SEC’s openness to a more efficient ETF process reflects a broader shift toward crypto integration within U.S. capital markets. Just days ago, the Commission approved in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for crypto ETFs, removing operational restrictions that previously limited efficiency and liquidity in the crypto ETF space. In a separate policy roadmap released July 31, the SEC announced sweeping plans to better accommodate tokenized assets, signifying a more supportive stance toward blockchain-based financial products. What This Means for XRP For XRP, this could mark a turning point. Current XRP ETF filings, some of which already passed public comment phases, are waiting on the SEC’s next move. If the generic listing framework is adopted, XRP ETF issuers that meet the requirements could quickly bring their products to market without additional regulatory hurdles. As SMQKE noted, a decision could arrive within 21 days, a timeline that would have been unthinkable under the old rules. If approved, XRP could soon follow Bitcoin and Ethereum into the U.S. ETF spotlight , offering institutional investors broader access to one of the world’s most actively used digital assets.

2025-08-01 19:00:36,49377076,1754074836,WeWake Presale Crypto Surges in Momentum as Ethereum Reveals Quantum-Resistant Roadmap,"Ethereum unveils a 10-year roadmap focused on quantum resistance, scalability, and maintaining 100% network uptime. WeWake presale crypto launches walletless and gasless access, removing barriers for Web3 adoption and developer integration. WeWake presale crypto gains traction as its whitepaper details zk-rollup scalability, Paymaster API, and WAKE token utilities. Ethereum has announced a 10-year roadmap focused on quantum resistance and scaling, and the update is drawing global attention. Ethereum developers revealed that their plan will help the network maintain security and performance while preparing for future technologies. At the same time, the WeWake presale crypto is gaining momentum as it introduces a walletless and gasless blockchain, making onboarding easier for new users and developers. Ethereum’s Long-Term Vision for Quantum Resistance and Scaling The Ethereum Foundation shared its roadmap, which aims to ensure network reliability, scalability, and security over the next decade. The plan will support 100% uptime and focus on countering future threats, including quantum computing. According to the foundation , the roadmap includes the use of hash-based cryptography and other post-quantum security methods. Vitalik Buterin has stated that Ethereum layer 1 will target 10,000 transactions per second, while layer 2 solutions will scale to one million transactions per second. These upgrades will include zkVMs and data availability sampling to enhance verification and efficiency. The new vision also proposes upgrades to the Ethereum Virtual Machine with a SNARK-friendly instruction set. This change is intended to strengthen security and improve the speed of cryptographic proofs. Ethereum developers believe these steps will enable the network to stay ahead of future challenges while maintaining its decentralized nature. WeWake Presale Crypto Gains Momentum with Walletless Access While Ethereum advances its roadmap, the WeWake presale crypto is rapidly attracting attention for its approach to user onboarding. The project offers a gasless and walletless system, allowing users to access Web3 services through social logins such as Google or Telegram. The WeWake whitepaper , which is now available, outlines its technical architecture and its ERC-4337 smart wallet design. It also explains how the built-in Paymaster API will sponsor transaction fees for users. This approach removes the need for seed phrases or browser extensions, which have historically created barriers for crypto adoption. By eliminating these hurdles, WeWake is positioning itself as a gateway for mass adoption of blockchain technology. The presale crypto phase is also fueling interest among developers. WeWake has released details of its software development kit (SDK) that enables dApps to integrate walletless access with minimal effort. This SDK supports instant swaps, NFT minting, and simplified onboarding for decentralized applications. Why WeWake Presale Crypto is Standing Out in the Market The WeWake presale crypto is not only gaining traction for its user experience but also for its roadmap. The project has outlined a detailed plan, starting with the launch of its testnet in Q1 2026, followed by a mainnet rollout in Q2 2026. Its token, WAKE, is central to the network. The whitepaper shows that WAKE will be used for governance, staking, and rewards. Developers will also benefit from ecosystem grants designed to accelerate adoption and integration. Early presale crypto participants will have access to discounted tokens and governance opportunities within the ecosystem. WeWake’s architecture uses zk-rollup scalability, social login authentication, and an integrated Paymaster to support gas-free transactions. This combination positions it as a platform capable of onboarding non-technical users while also appealing to developers seeking faster integration tools.

2025-08-01 19:00:13,49376296,1754074813,Spartans Tops the 2025 List of Provably Fair Crypto Gambling Platforms – Here Are the 6 Others,"For players who value fairness, transparency, and fast access to their winnings, probably fair crypto gambling platforms offer a better alternative to traditional online casinos. These platforms allow users to verify every game outcome through on-chain or cryptographic proofs, giving players the power to confirm that no manipulation has occurred. The best sites also combine this fairness with fast crypto payments and a wide selection of games. In 2025, Spartans stands out for delivering all three: verifiable game outcomes, instant withdrawals, and smooth cross-platform gameplay. Here’s a breakdown of the top seven provably fair crypto gambling platforms worth trying today. 1. Spartans: Best Overall for Fairness and Fast Payouts Spartans.com ranks #1 among provably fair crypto gambling platforms for one simple reason: it gives players both transparency and control. Every slot, crash game, and dice-based experience on Spartans is powered by verifiable fairness protocols. Players can check seed hashes, verify results, and confirm game outcomes using on-chain systems or server-client randomness models. Nothing is left to chance, or at least not an unprovable chance. What sets Spartans apart from the rest is how easy it is to access this data. With just one click, users can see exactly how a game outcome was generated. And unlike many platforms that delay withdrawals or hold up crypto payouts during audits, Spartans guarantees instant withdrawals. Once a player requests their winnings, whether it’s in BTC, ETH, USDT, or AVAX, the funds land in their wallet within seconds, not hours. The platform supports over 5,900 games from 43+ providers, all playable with major cryptocurrencies. Its fairness engine runs silently in the background while users enjoy high-volatility slots, crash multipliers, or classic table games. With provable fairness baked into every spin and lightning-speed payments, Spartans offers players the trust and responsiveness they deserve. 2. Stake.com: Reliable Fairness, Slower Withdrawals Stake.com is a familiar name in crypto gambling, with strong systems in place for provable fairness. The platform allows users to view bet hashes, nonce values, and result data across a variety of in-house games. While Stake is technically sound, its crypto withdrawal times, especially for larger amounts, can range from minutes to hours, depending on account verification and platform activity. It’s trusted, but not the fastest. 3. Roobet: Trusted Fairness With Some Payment Friction Roobet earns its place among the top provably fair crypto gambling platforms thanks to its long-standing use of cryptographic fairness tools in games like crash and dice. Players can verify outcomes in real time, and the user interface makes accessing fairness data relatively simple. However, Roobet’s withdrawal process isn’t as instant as Spartans. Larger payouts often require manual approval, and some currencies take longer to process. 4. Gamdom: Transparent Games With Mixed Speed Gamdom offers verifiable outcomes across its custom games, including roulette, crash, and trade-up formats. Players have access to hash verification tools that confirm randomness. While the platform’s transparency is commendable, crypto payment processing is inconsistent. Some players report fast transactions, while others face waiting times or minor hiccups depending on the token used. 5. BC.Game: Wide Variety, Moderate Fairness Tools BC.Game features a huge catalog of crypto games and includes fairness verification on many of its proprietary titles. It offers hash chain previews and roll confirmations. However, the platform’s UX makes it harder to quickly audit outcomes, and its withdrawal speed doesn’t match leaders like Spartans. Still, for players who prioritize variety and occasional fair-play verification, it’s worth a look. 6. BetMGM: Great Reputation, Limited Crypto Fairness BetMGM is known for its strong brand and regulatory compliance, but its support for provably fair systems is limited. The platform accepts some cryptocurrencies, yet game fairness verification tools are sparse. For players who want airtight trust with transparent randomness in every game, BetMGM might feel closer to a traditional betting site than a crypto-native solution. 7. Betano: Regional Favorite With Basic Crypto Support Betano is popular in several international markets and has recently added crypto payment options. However, its game fairness model is closer to conventional platforms, with no built-in provable randomness system in place. Crypto withdrawals also vary by region, which can affect the user experience for globally active players. Last Say Choosing the right provably fair crypto gambling platform can make all the difference in how much trust and control you have over your bets. Spartans leads the pack in 2025 by offering instant, verifiable game results and rapid crypto withdrawals without red tape. Other platforms like Stake.com and Roobet offer transparency, but can’t quite match the speed or ease of access Spartans provides. Whether you’re chasing multipliers, playing blackjack, or betting live on sports, provable fairness is essential, and Spartans is setting the gold standard for it this year.

2025-08-01 19:00:08,49376476,1754074808,"IMF now believes Bitcoin holds real economic value, necessitating the need for the SNA update","The International Monetary Fund, United Nations, World Bank, European Commission, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development worked to update the new System of National Accounts (SNA) to fully incorporate emerging technologies, digital services, and intangible assets. According to the IMF, the revised SNA will factor in digitalization, trade, government finances, and financial innovation, providing governments with better tools to guide economic growth, job creation, and crisis response. It also insisted that economies adapt to digital transformation. In its statement, the bank warned , “Measurement across the $114 trillion global economy must keep up even as the pace of change accelerates. If it doesn’t keep pace, central banks and finance ministries will end up setting monetary or fiscal policy based on incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate information.” IMF believes Bitcoin holds real economic value, necessitating the need for the SNA update Now in its sixth iteration, the SNA has served nearly nine decades as the international standard for tracking national metrics like output, income, spending, investment, financial flows, and wealth. With the latest update, the IMF hopes to better capture the impact of digitalization, which is often underreported. The international bank noted that while digital transformation has accelerated, productivity figures in many developed countries have slowed, raising questions about the adequacy of existing measurement frameworks. Additionally, the IMF argued that Bitcoin holds real economic value and consumes as much electricity as Argentina. Yet, it remains excluded from GDP calculations because it does not produce conventional goods or services. As a result, the revised standards will also extend to crypto assets, to better align with their increasing status within a new world economy. It further stated that some experts have found ways to classify particular crypto assets as “non-produced nonfinancial assets,” meaning they can be accounted for in measures of national wealth. The SNA will include recommendations to curb financial risks and instability The updated SNA also calls on nations to develop comprehensive metrics for sectors like AI, cloud computing , e-commerce, and digital platforms. It also offers a unified definition of artificial intelligence to promote consistent treatment in national economic data. Furthermore, it includes recommendations to better monitor financial risks and instability, given the rise of non-bank institutions. It also offers a more detailed view of major multinational firms’ production and profit distribution practices. According to the IMF, the information will enable national accounts to more effectively capture the output and earnings of multinational companies that outsource production but keep control of core assets like design, branding, and IP. The framework also elevates net domestic product (NDP) as a key metric alongside GDP. NDP goes a step further by deducting capital depreciation and natural resource depletion—factors overlooked in standard GDP figures.

However, a new development on the Cardano network could soon help turn the tide in ADA’s favor. This week, USDM , a native Cardano-based stablecoin developed by Moneta , officially launched. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, has called it “the most advanced stablecoin ever built,” suggesting it could be a game-changer for the Cardano ecosystem as it competes for real-world utility and institutional interest. Moneta's USDM is becoming the most advanced stablecoin ever built https://t.co/r32xbbfCbE — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 31, 2025 Moneta’s stablecoin is a privacy-focused asset that caters to enterprise-grade needs. According to data from DeFi Llama, stablecoin reserves in Cardano currently sit at $36 million – a negligible amount compared to the more than $11.4 billion reserves boasted by Solana and mere pocket change compared to $133 billion in stable assets parked in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Moneta (USDM) already dominates this market with a 32% dominance. The reason for this is that Cardano does not support traditional stable assets like USDT or USDC. Hence, the launch of USDM could foster a new era for Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, which supports a long-term bullish Cardano price prediction . Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Hits Key Trend Line Support Today Trading volumes today have increased by 9% as the price of ADA has hit a key trend line support. The crypto market was in need of a more pronounced correction like this after rallying for nearly a month. We can see that negative momentum has been accelerating as ADA got close to $1. The 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) seems poised to cross below the 21-day EMA and send a first ‘sell’ signal while the price has also hit the 200-day EMA. The confluence between ‘TL1’ and this key indicator increases the odds of a strong bounce. However, the price could break below this area and could still find support at ‘TL2’. This scenario would still keep the uptrend alive while the last line of defense before a ‘trend reversal’ verdict can be given would be the $0.61 level. The price action still favors a bullish Cardano price prediction at the moment as long as any of these support areas hold. The launch of USDM is exciting news for ADA. However, the best crypto presales like SUBBD (SUBBD) could outperform well-established tokens, especially as ‘altcoin season’ could start at any moment. SUBBD Raises Nearly $1M to Build the Ultimate Platform for Creators SUBBD (SUBBD) is reimagining how influencers earn online, giving them full control, better payouts, and a censorship-free space to grow. This new platform lets creators monetize not only their original work but also AI-generated content, opening the door to real passive income. With nearly $1 million already raised in its presale, SUBBD is quickly becoming one of the most exciting creator-focused projects in crypto. This project stands out by offering low platform fees and removing the unfair bans that often limit creators’ earnings on centralized platforms. Through the SUBBD governance token , influencers get a real voice in shaping moderation policies — something unheard of in traditional content platforms. Fans can also use the token to unlock subscription discounts , get early access to features , and enjoy other exclusive perks. With over 2,000 creators already onboarded and millions of followers behind them, demand for SUBBD could surge rapidly once the platform launches. To buy $SUBBD at its discounted presale price and reap the highest returns, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-08-01 18:47:52,49375821,1754074072,"Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Bill Takes Effect, Licensing Regime Now in Force","Key Takeaways: Hong Kong’s licensing regime could allow HKD- and CNY-pegged stablecoins to compete in Asian settlement markets dominated by the USD. Regulatory clarity may encourage institutional entry, but smaller firms could face high compliance costs under the new framework. Non‑USD stablecoin initiatives could test whether regional demand supports alternatives to dollar-backed assets in practical financial operations. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Bill officially took effect on August 1, establishing a licensing regime for fiat‑referenced stablecoin issuers. Under the new Ordinance, any entity issuing fiat‑referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong—or abroad if pegged to the Hong Kong dollar—must obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Hong Kong Among First Regions to Regulate Stablecoins According to a recent report , issuers are required to maintain proper reserve asset management, segregate client assets, operate stabilization mechanisms, and honor redemption requests at par value under reasonable conditions. The law also mandates compliance with anti‑money laundering and counter‑terrorist financing standards, risk management protocols, disclosure rules, audits, and fit‑and‑proper criteria. The Monetary Authority said it will conduct further consultations on detailed requirements in the future. Only designated licensed institutions may sell fiat‑referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong, and retail investors are limited to those issued by licensed providers. To combat fraud, advertising for unlicensed stablecoin issuance is prohibited, including during the six‑month non‑contravention period. Non-USD Options Emerge in Alternative Markets The Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council in May now places Hong Kong among the first global financial hubs with a dedicated licensing system for fiat‑referenced stablecoins. By enforcing strict reserve and redemption rules, the framework seeks to reduce systemic risks and protect retail participants. Green fintech is reshaping finance for a sustainable future. As climate action and ESG integration take centre stage globally, this powerful fusion of finance and technology is driving real change. pic.twitter.com/gadX2UN2ny — HKMA 香港金融管理局 (@hkmagovhk) July 30, 2025 Institutional adoption may increase under the regime, as regulatory clarity often attracts larger financial players. However, compliance costs could limit participation from smaller firms, potentially concentrating the market among major issuers. The law also positions Hong Kong to compete with jurisdictions like the U.S. and Singapore, where stablecoin frameworks are advancing. International alignment may prove key in drawing cross‑border capital and facilitating regulatory cooperation. With the U.S. dollar-based stablecoins taking the lead in the global market, products like the HKD stablecoins and offshore CNY stablecoins are exploring opportunities to break out of the USD dominance in regional markets. If successful, the launch of non-USD stablecoins could offer a widely accepted alternative to mainstream settlement measures. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Will the licensing regime impact stablecoin transaction fees in Hong Kong? By enforcing reserve and compliance requirements, issuers may face higher operational costs, which could influence transaction fees for users. What protections exist if a licensed stablecoin issuer fails? The reserve segregation and redemption rules are designed to ensure holders can redeem at par value even if the issuer collapses. Could banks in Hong Kong play a role in issuing licensed stablecoins? Yes. The framework opens a pathway for traditional financial institutions to issue fiat‑referenced stablecoins under strict regulatory oversight.

ChatGPT’s ETH analysis synthesizes 26 real-time technical indicators, ETF institutional flows, 10th anniversary developments, and ecosystem growth metrics to assess ETH’s 90-day trajectory amid key technical inflection between healthy consolidation and explosive breakout momentum. Technical Analysis: Healthy Pullback Within Strong Bullish Structure Ethereum’s current price of $3,616 reflects a -2.24% daily decline from $3,699 , establishing a trading range between $3,725 (high) and $3,568 (low). This controlled volatility demonstrates healthy correction within a strong uptrend structure. Source: TradingView Moving averages reveal an exceptional bullish structure with ETH above all major EMAs: 20-day at $3,539 ( +2.1% ), 50-day at $3,136 ( +13.3% ), 100-day at $2,828 ( +21.8% ), and 200-day at $2,693 ( +25.5% ). This represents one of ETH’s strongest technical setups recently. The RSI at 60.95 sits in neutral-bullish territory with substantial room for continued upward movement. MACD shows mixed signs at -35.25, but a positive histogram at 270.03 suggests building momentum despite bearish positioning. Source: TradingView Volume at 31.4K ETH indicates steady institutional participation, while ATR at 2,540 suggests a high volatility environment with potential for massive moves once consolidation resolves. Historical Context: Explosive Recovery from Spring Correction Ethereum’s 2025 performance demonstrates strong resilience with explosive recovery from April’s $1,385 low to current consolidation above $3,600 . This 168%+ appreciation showcases fundamental strength and institutional confidence. January-March correction from $3,298 to $1,823 , followed by April’s decline to $1,500 , established institutional accumulation opportunities. The decisive spring bottom marked the foundation for explosive recovery momentum. May-July recovery showed consistent strength with ETH rebounding from $1,700 to $3,650 in June, continuing toward current levels. Source: TradingView This 51.84% monthly gain represents Ethereum’s strongest performance since 2022 . Current pricing sits 25.75% below all-time high while maintaining extraordinary 862,000%+ gains from 2015 lows, showing both remaining upside potential and proven institutional-grade appreciation capacity. Support & Resistance: Multiple Strong EMA Support Layers Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $3,568 , reinforced by the key 20-day EMA at $3,539 . This confluence provides primary defense with multiple EMA layers, creating exceptional downside protection. Key support demonstrates strong depth with 50-day EMA at $3,136 ( +13.3% buffer), 100-day EMA at $2,828 ( +21.8% buffer), and 200-day EMA at $2,693 ( +25.5% buffer). Resistance begins at today’s high around $3,725 , followed by psychological resistance at $3,800-$3,900 . Source: TradingView Major resistance emerges at $4,000-$4,100, where previous cycle highs create overhead pressure requiring substantial volume. The setup suggests pullbacks would find multiple support levels, while a breakout above $3,725 could trigger rapid appreciation toward $3,800-$4,000 based on ETF momentum. ETF Breakthrough: BlackRock Leads Institutional Adoption BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF recorded exceptional $17.65 million daily inflows, contributing to total ETF net flows of $29.83 million across nine Ethereum ETFs. Source: SosoValue This represents unprecedented mainstream institutional adoption.

Source: TradingView Technical targets include $4,000 , $4,500 , and $5,500 based on historical resistance levels and institutional flow projections.

This sideways action could extend 6-10 weeks pending major catalyst developments. Correction on Market Weakness (20% Probability) Broader crypto market weakness could trigger selling toward $3,100-$3,400 support levels, representing 10-15% downside from current levels.

ChatGPT’s ETH Analysis: Institutional Validation Meets Technical Strength Ethereum’s positioning reflects unprecedented convergence of institutional validation through ETF adoption, technical strength above all EMAs, and ecosystem milestone momentum. Next Price Target: $5,000-$6,000 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires decisive recovery above $3,725 resistance to validate continued institutional momentum over healthy consolidation. From there, ETF adoption acceleration could propel Ethereum toward $5,000 psychological milestone, with sustained institutional flows driving toward $6,000+, representing new cycle preparation highs. However, failure to reclaim $3,725 would signal extended consolidation to $3,400-$3,600 range as the market experiences profit-taking.

According to the NYT report , this round of investors, which includes Blackstone, TPG, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Andreessen Horowitz, and other financial giants, has helped blow up OpenAI’s valuation to $300 billion. OpenAI has been planning to raise $40 billion by the end of 2025. When OpenAI announced its ambitions back in March, SoftBank immediately provided $30 billion towards the goal. Now, in addition to $2.5 billion from venture capitalists earlier this year, OpenAI has raised a reported $40.8 billion, way ahead of schedule. For its latest round, OpenAI’s biggest investor was Dragoneer Investment Group, a venture capitalist firm that coughed up $2.8 billion for the leading AI project. Furthermore, OpenAI’s revenues are up $3 billion over the last month, with paid subscribers reaching the 5 million mark. Co-founder Sam Altman’s other project, the ID-focused crypto Worldcoin ( WLD ), has also been growing this year, launching in the US in May. Despite the expansion of iris-scanning devices, WLD is dipping alongside the rest of the crypto markets, trading for $0.987 at time of writing, about even with its position three months ago, and down 52% since last year.

2025-08-01 18:40:10,49375603,1754073610,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Navigating the Sudden Plunge Below $114,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Navigating the Sudden Plunge Below $114,000 The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic shifts, recently witnessed a significant event: a notable Bitcoin price drop . For many investors and enthusiasts, seeing Bitcoin (BTC) fall below the $114,000 mark has prompted questions and concerns. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading around $113,900.01 on the Binance USDT market, according to recent market monitoring. This movement highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets and underscores the importance of understanding the forces at play in this evolving financial landscape. What does this latest downturn signify, and how should participants approach such market movements? Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop When the price of Bitcoin experiences a sudden decline, it often triggers a wave of analysis and speculation across the crypto community. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $114,000 is a case in point. This specific movement, observed on major exchanges like Binance, where BTC touched $113,900.01 against USDT, indicates a bearish sentiment taking hold in the short term. It is important to look beyond the immediate number and consider the broader context. Several immediate factors might contribute to such a sharp decline. These can include large sell orders from institutional investors or ‘whales,’ negative news headlines, or even cascading liquidations in the derivatives market. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, making them susceptible to rapid price changes at any hour. This constant activity means that a Bitcoin price drop can occur quickly, often without prior warning, necessitating constant vigilance from traders and investors. Here is a snapshot of the recent market movement: Metric Value Reported Price (Binance USDT) $113,900.01 Previous Support Level (Approx.) $114,000 24-Hour Price Change (Approx.) Significant Negative % What Factors Influence a Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the root causes behind a Bitcoin price drop is crucial for any market participant. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a complex interplay of macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and unique market dynamics. It’s rarely just one factor, but often a combination that triggers significant price movements. Macroeconomic Influences: Global economic conditions play a substantial role. When traditional markets experience uncertainty, such as rising inflation or interest rate hikes by central banks, investors might liquidate riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, to move into safer havens. Conversely, a strong economy can sometimes encourage more speculative investments, but a downturn often triggers a Bitcoin price drop as capital seeks less volatile options. Regulatory News and Uncertainty: Government regulations or the lack thereof, can significantly impact investor confidence. News of stricter regulations, bans in certain countries, or even just proposals for new rules can lead to a sudden sell-off, contributing to a Bitcoin price drop . Conversely, clear and favorable regulatory frameworks can instill confidence and attract more investment. Market Sentiment and News Cycles: The cryptocurrency market is heavily driven by sentiment. Positive news, such as major institutional adoption or technological breakthroughs, can fuel rallies. Negative news, like security breaches, scams, or even influential figures expressing bearish views, can trigger fear and panic selling, leading to a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Social media and mainstream news play a large part in shaping this sentiment. Technical Analysis and Liquidation Events: Traders often use technical analysis to predict future price movements based on historical data. When key support levels are broken, it can trigger automated sell orders, accelerating a decline. Furthermore, in leveraged trading, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can lead to massive liquidation events, where positions are automatically closed, further exacerbating the downward pressure. Navigating Volatility: Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Drop Experiencing a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, but it also presents opportunities for those who understand how to navigate market volatility. Rather than succumbing to panic, adopting a strategic approach can help manage risk and potentially capitalize on future recoveries. What are some effective strategies to consider when the market takes a downturn? 1. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. When the Bitcoin price drop occurs, your fixed investment buys more Bitcoin, lowering your average purchase price over time. This approach reduces the impact of volatility and removes the need to time the market perfectly. 2. Holding (HODLing): For long-term investors, simply holding onto assets through market downturns is a common strategy. Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant dips and reached new all-time highs. This approach requires patience and a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, allowing one to ride out a temporary Bitcoin price drop . 3. Risk Management and Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can limit potential losses during a sudden Bitcoin price drop . A stop-loss order automatically sells your asset if it falls to a predetermined price, preventing further decline in your portfolio value. Understanding your risk tolerance is key to setting these levels appropriately. 4. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a significant asset, diversifying your crypto portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or even traditional assets can mitigate the impact of a single asset’s decline. If Bitcoin experiences a sharp Bitcoin price drop , other assets in your portfolio might perform differently, balancing out overall losses. 5. Continuous Research and Education: Staying informed about market trends, technological developments, and regulatory news is paramount. A deeper understanding of the factors influencing a Bitcoin price drop allows for more informed decision-making, rather than reacting based on emotion. Historical Context of Bitcoin Price Drop Events Is the recent Bitcoin price drop an isolated event, or is it part of a larger pattern? History shows that Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by periods of extreme volatility, including numerous significant price corrections. Understanding this historical context can provide perspective and help investors avoid impulsive decisions. Since its inception, Bitcoin has experienced multiple cycles of massive rallies followed by substantial corrections, often referred to as ‘bear markets’ or ‘crypto winters.’ For example, after reaching nearly $20,000 in late 2017, Bitcoin plunged to around $3,000 in 2018. Similarly, after its peak in late 2021, it saw another significant Bitcoin price drop throughout 2022. These past events, while painful for short-term holders, have consistently been followed by periods of recovery and new all-time highs. This historical resilience suggests that a Bitcoin price drop , while concerning in the moment, is a characteristic feature of its market. It reflects the asset’s growth phase, where speculative interest and fundamental adoption often clash. Long-term proponents view these dips as healthy market corrections, flushing out excess leverage and allowing for more organic growth. A chart showing Bitcoin’s historical price movements, highlighting periods of significant drops and subsequent recoveries. Bitcoin Price Drop: Navigating the Sudden Plunge Below $114,000 What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Drop? Predicting the exact future of any financial asset, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin, is challenging. However, market analysts and experts offer various perspectives on what might follow the current Bitcoin price drop . These insights are often based on technical indicators, on-chain data, and broader economic forecasts. Some analysts suggest that the current Bitcoin price drop could be a healthy correction, necessary to consolidate gains made during recent rallies. They might point to strong fundamental adoption, increasing institutional interest, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving events as factors that could drive long-term price appreciation. In this view, the current dip could be seen as a buying opportunity for those with a long-term horizon. Conversely, others might caution that further downside is possible if macroeconomic conditions worsen or if major support levels fail to hold. They may highlight ongoing regulatory uncertainties or potential shifts in global liquidity as risks. Monitoring key resistance and support levels on price charts becomes crucial for short-term traders looking to capitalize on or protect against further movements following a Bitcoin price drop . Ultimately, the trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on a confluence of factors, including global economic stability, regulatory clarity, technological advancements within the blockchain ecosystem, and sustained investor demand. Staying informed and adopting a well-thought-out investment strategy is more important than attempting to predict the exact bottom or peak. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $114,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be unsettling, they are a characteristic part of Bitcoin’s journey. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to these price changes, from macroeconomic trends to market sentiment, is essential. More importantly, adopting sound strategies like dollar-cost averaging, maintaining a long-term perspective, and continuous education can empower investors to navigate these volatile periods effectively. Bitcoin’s history shows a remarkable ability to recover and achieve new milestones, suggesting that resilience remains a core aspect of its market. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, informed decision-making remains the most valuable tool for any participant. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did the Bitcoin price drop below $114,000? The exact reason for a specific Bitcoin price drop can be complex, often resulting from a combination of factors. These can include large sell-offs by significant holders (whales), negative macroeconomic news (like interest rate hikes or inflation concerns), regulatory uncertainty, or a general shift in market sentiment towards risk aversion. Technical analysis also plays a role, as breaking key support levels can trigger further selling. 2. Is a Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? For long-term investors, a Bitcoin price drop is often seen as a potential buying opportunity, especially when employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging. This allows investors to acquire Bitcoin at a lower average price. However, it’s crucial to conduct your own research, understand the risks, and invest only what you can afford to lose, as prices can always go lower. 3. How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? The duration of a Bitcoin price drop varies significantly. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced both short, sharp corrections lasting days or weeks, and prolonged bear markets extending for months or even over a year. There is no fixed timeline, as market recovery depends on various internal and external factors. Patience is often required during these periods. 4. How can I protect my investments during a Bitcoin price drop? Several strategies can help protect your investments during a Bitcoin price drop . These include setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying your portfolio across different assets, practicing dollar-cost averaging to reduce the impact of volatility, and avoiding emotional decisions by sticking to a well-defined investment plan. Staying informed about market news is also crucial. 5. What is the difference between a correction and a bear market for Bitcoin? A correction typically refers to a short-term price decline of 10-20% (or more) from a recent peak, often seen as a healthy market adjustment. A bear market, on the other hand, is a more prolonged and significant decline, usually defined as a 20% or more drop from recent highs, sustained over a longer period, indicating a broader negative trend. Both involve a Bitcoin price drop , but differ in scale and duration. If you found this analysis helpful, please share it with your friends and on social media platforms!

2025-08-01 18:33:29,49375323,1754073209,Coinbase Tanks 11% Pre-Market After $1.5B Q2 Revenue Miss,"Coinbase shares fell sharply after the company reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations. Total revenue for the quarter came in at $1.5 billion, representing a 26% decline from the previous quarter. The shortfall was largely driven by weaker-than-expected transaction revenue, which fell 39% quarter-over-quarter to $764 million. Missing Expectations In the official release, Coinbase revealed that its subscription and services revenue also declined 6% to $656 million. Despite efforts to reduce variable costs, operating expenses climbed 15% to $1.5 billion. Coinbase attributed this largely to the $307 million hit related to the data breach disclosed in May. The crypto exchange recorded a net income of $1.4 billion, but this figure included $1.5 billion in pre-tax unrealized gains from strategic investments, including in Circle, as well as a $362 million pre-tax gain from its crypto investment portfolio. On an adjusted basis, net income stood at just $33 million, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $512 million. Coinbase’s trading activity also underperformed the broader crypto spot market, as global and US crypto spot volumes declined 31% and 32% respectively. Meanwhile, its total trading volume fell 40% to $237 billion, and the consumer segment witnessed a 45% drop to $43 billion. Consumer transaction revenue plunged 41% to $650 million, as volume shifted toward Simple trades amid low volatility. Institutional transaction revenue also saw a similar pattern, down 38% in both volume and revenue. While Base Chain activity grew, other transaction revenue dropped 21% as average revenue per transaction declined. As of the close on the previous trading day, Coinbase (COIN) shares were priced at $377.76, up slightly by $0.28. However, pre-market trading shows a sharp decline, with the stock down $42.30 (-11.20%) to $335.46. This steep drop suggests a strong negative reaction from investors, likely in response to recent earnings results. Despite grappling with declining revenues and rising costs, Coinbase is doubling down on product innovation. “Everything App” Earlier this month, Coinbase rebranded its Wallet as the Base app, launching a crypto-focused “everything app” that merges trading, social media, USDC payments, mini-apps, and tokenized posts. Announced at its “A New Day One” conference, the app runs on Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer 2 network and integrates Farcaster for social feeds, Zora for post tokenization, and encrypted XMTP chat. Users can earn from tips, interact with AI agents, and make one-tap payments. The platform also introduced Base Pay for Shopify merchants and plans 1% USDC cashback in the US. The app is in beta, while a full public release and developer tools are expected soon.

2025-08-01 18:30:43,49375615,1754073043,Strategy Outlines Bold Bitcoin Goals as it Leads Corporate Adoption,"Michael Saylor has once again shown strong support for the world-leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC). Speaking at a recent interview with CNBC , Saylor said that Strategy may one day hold as much as 1.5 million BTC. That would be nearly 7% of all Bitcoin in global circulation. This is a clear sign that the company plans to continue buying more. It also shows Saylor’s firm belief that the flagship crypto is the best choice for long-term store of value. Strategy Focus on Building a Large Bitcoin Reserve As of August 1, 2025, Strategy leads the corporate Bitcoin strategy, holding 628,791 BTC, 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. At current market prices, that stash is worth over $40 billion. However, Saylor believes the company could grow its holdings much more in the future. He explained that reaching 1.5 million Bitcoin is possible, although it may not happen all at once. The executive chairman described the top coin as “digital capital,” a new kind of money that powers Strategy’s business model. The company raises funds by offering preferred stock, then uses that money to buy more Bitcoin. This method lowers risk for shareholders and creates a way to earn returns. Recently, a planned stock offering of $500 million was increased to $2.5 billion due to high demand. It became the largest public stock offering so far this year, showing how strong investor interest has become. More Public Companies Are Buying Bitcoin During the interview, Saylor pointed out that more companies are starting to hold Bitcoin as part of their business strategy. Last year, about 60 public companies held digital coins; however, that number has increased to 160 today. Firms including Capital B, Smarter Web, and 21, a firm backed by Anthony Pompliano, Japanese-based Metaplanet have joined the movement. As he further explained, big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft are limited in how they can invest their profits. They cannot easily buy each other’s stock, and they face restrictions on buying into the broader S&P 500. As a result, some are now turning to Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. He believes the digital currency is replacing other assets like gold, foreign property, and public stocks. Strategy’s Financial Results Are Strong Strategy’s financial performance has also been strong. In the most recent quarter, the company reported earnings of $32.52 per share. This result was far above expectations, which had predicted a loss of $0.09. This shows that the company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy is working well. Other companies are also increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, reportedly added 2,509 Bitcoin in the second quarter. This makes Coinbase one of the top ten public companies holding Bitcoin, ahead of even Tesla.

2025-08-01 18:30:08,49375211,1754073008,How Long Will the Bitcoin and Altcoin Bull Run Last? Analyst Gives a Timeframe,"Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson said in his latest assessment that Bitcoin is nearing the end of the cycle for long-term investors, but argued that the bull market is not completely over yet. According to Wedson, there could be at least two more months of upward movement for Bitcoin and three more months for altcoins. Wedson noted that despite the growing influence of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been a strong wave of distributions from long-term investors. These sales amount to 50% of all Bitcoin held in ETFs. “Therefore, it would be a mistake to rely solely on ETFs, miners or individual groups,” Wedson said, adding that those who still influence the market the most are old investors and major exchanges. Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Donald Trump's Nuclear Threat Hits Cryptocurrencies - Here's the Latest Data Wedson, who included various on-chain indicators in his analysis, highlighted three key metrics: The last two years have seen significant increases in the movement of old BTC. This coincides with three major local peaks and serves as an effective indicator for identifying long-term investor sell-offs. Reserve Risk Indicator: This indicator, used to understand long-term investor behavior, has recently given a signal indicating increased selling and handover. SOPR Trend Signal: This metric, which analyzes all on-chain movements for profit or loss, issued a bearish signal a few weeks ago, warning of short positions ahead of the recent decline. In concluding his statement, Wedson argued that the Bitcoin cycle is still valid and the existence of ETFs does not disrupt this cycle. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, market watchers are shifting their focus to a new player quickly gaining momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Trading at $0.035, this emerging DeFi project has captured trader interest. Investors who join the presale now in phase 6 are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment when the project launches at $0.06. MUTM has raised more than $13.8 million and has gained over 14,700 investors. Dogecoin (DOGE) Stands at $0.24 Dogecoin is trading near the $0.24 mark, up over the past three weeks or so by about 44 percent since the coin started at an approximate $0.17 at the beginning of the month with volume trends holding just above the critical support area between the $0.22 to the $0.23 mark and seeing more consecutive bounce materials favoring a recent double-bottom implementation. Analysts observe the establishment of bullish patterns like golden cross and bullish open interest formation that would likely guide a break above the current levels into the $0.30s to $0.35s in the near future, in case the bullishness persists. Mutuum Finance Presale Growth Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of the presale, following a faster-than-expected sellout of stage 5. The subsequent stage will have the token price rise by 14.29% to $0.04. Early investors will enjoy an initial gain of 71.43% since the token goes onto the market at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has so far raised over $13.8 million, while the project has attracted over 14,700 investors, and estimates put the token at $2 following launch. Pioneering the Next Era of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is a platform in which the users retain control of the assets during the lending process. MUTM’s double-model which features Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer loan frameworks is applied to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Smart contracts facilitate Human-less lending in the Peer-to-Contract model. These smart contracts are market-driven through dynamic interest rates to maintain high interest rates. Peer-to-Peer architecture takes out middlemen and offers lenders and borrowers direct access. The architecture is utilized by users when dealing with meme coins like Shiba Inu, which are extremely volatile in nature. Enhancing DeFi Security Through $50K Bug Bounty and Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is conducting a $100,000 giveaway . There will be 10 winners that will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The project has also created a new leaderboard with the top 50 token holders that will be rewarded with bonus tokens for their positions. In order to further solidify its platform, Mutuum Finance has recently introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. Every bug will be rewarded, and the bounty will be distributed across four tiers, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dogecoin (DOGE) may be on track for a potential 2x rally, but with upside capped near $0.40, traders seeking exponential returns are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, MUTM offers early investors a guaranteed 71.43% ROI when the token launches at $0.06, and that’s just the beginning. With over $13.8 million raised, 14,700+ holders, a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty, and a $100,000 giveaway, the project is combining strong fundamentals with explosive momentum. Forecasts even suggest a potential rise toward $2 post-launch. Secure your presale position before the next price jump locks you out.

The data seems likely to put an end to the wait-and-see approach of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and set the central bank on a path to restarting rate cuts at its next meeting in September. That's sent the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond plunging 14 basis points to 4.22% and the price of gold pumping 1.5% to $3,400 per ounce and back within sight of its record high. Whither two other interest-rate sensitive assets: bitcoin and stocks? Not so much. With about 90 minutes to go in the U.S. trading session, both are at session lows, with the Nasdaq plunging 2.5% and bitcoin down more than 3% to $113,800. And bitcoin's an outperformer.

The president weighs in ""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell is a disaster,"" said President Trump on Truth Social shortly after the jobs report. ""DROP THE RATE."" Minutes ago, the president again took to his social media platform to call for the firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commission of Labor Statstics (the group overseeing the jobs data), accusing her of cooking the books to boost Biden/Harris last year and make things look worse under his administration.

2025-08-01 08:25:10,49350474,1754036710,Billions Network Funding: A Breakthrough $30M Boost for AI Verification,"BitcoinWorld Billions Network Funding: A Breakthrough $30M Boost for AI Verification In a significant development poised to reshape the landscape of digital identity and security, the Billions Network, a pioneering platform focused on human and AI verification, has successfully secured a substantial $30 million in total funding. This impressive Billions Network funding round marks a pivotal moment for the burgeoning ‘internet of value,’ signaling strong investor confidence in the network’s innovative approach to safeguarding digital interactions. For anyone navigating the complexities of Web3, decentralized finance, and the broader digital economy, this news is a powerful indicator of future trends in secure and verifiable online presence. What is the Billions Network and Its Ambitious Vision? The Billions Network positions itself as a mobile-first platform dedicated to human and AI verification. Its core mission is to support the growth and security of the ‘internet of value’ – a concept where digital assets, identities, and transactions are inherently trustworthy and verifiable. In an era plagued by bots, fraud, and identity theft, the need for robust verification mechanisms is more critical than ever. The Billions Network aims to bridge this gap by offering a hybrid solution that combines the efficiency and scalability of artificial intelligence with the nuanced discernment of human review. This dual-pronged approach is designed to create a more secure and reliable digital ecosystem, enabling seamless and trustworthy interactions across various applications, from financial services to social platforms. The recent Billions Network funding will undoubtedly accelerate its efforts to realize this ambitious vision. Decoding the $30 Million Billions Network Funding Round The announcement of $30 million in Billions Network funding, shared via their official X account, highlights the significant interest from leading venture capital firms and blockchain-focused investors. This capital injection is not just a financial milestone; it is a vote of confidence from entities deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency and technology sectors. The funds are earmarked for scaling the platform’s AI capabilities, expanding its human verification network, and driving global adoption. This strategic investment will empower Billions Network to enhance its technology, onboard more users, and integrate its solutions across a wider range of decentralized applications and traditional enterprises. The implications of this substantial Billions Network funding for the future of secure online interactions are vast. Investor Name Key Investment Focus (General) Significance to Billions Network Polychain Capital Leading crypto venture fund Deep expertise in blockchain infrastructure Coinbase Ventures Venture arm of major crypto exchange Connects to broad user base and ecosystem Polygon Leading blockchain scaling solution Strategic partner for integration and scalability Liberty City Ventures Early-stage fintech and blockchain investor Experience in disruptive financial technologies BITKRAFT Ventures Specialized in gaming and interactive entertainment Insights into high-engagement digital platforms Why is AI and Human Verification Essential for the Internet of Value? The internet of value relies on trust. Whether it is transferring digital assets, verifying identities for KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance in DeFi, or ensuring genuine participation in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), accurate verification is paramount. Traditional verification methods often fall short in the decentralized world, being either too centralized, too slow, or susceptible to sophisticated bot attacks. Here is why a hybrid approach, bolstered by the Billions Network funding, is crucial: Combating Bots and Fraud: AI can quickly detect patterns of fraudulent activity and bot behavior, while human verification adds a layer of nuanced judgment that AI alone might miss. Ensuring Genuine Participation: In decentralized governance, ensuring that each participant is a unique, real person prevents sybil attacks and maintains the integrity of voting systems. Scalability and Efficiency: AI handles the bulk of routine verifications, allowing human reviewers to focus on complex or edge cases, leading to a highly efficient and scalable system. Adaptability to New Threats: The combination allows the system to learn and adapt to evolving fraud tactics, providing a dynamic defense against emerging threats. The Billions Network funding will directly support the enhancement of these critical capabilities. The Power of Hybrid Verification: AI and Human Synergy The synergy between artificial intelligence and human intelligence is the cornerstone of Billions Network’s value proposition. AI offers unparalleled speed and the ability to process vast amounts of data, identifying anomalies and potential risks with precision. However, AI can sometimes lack the contextual understanding or the ability to interpret subtle human cues that are essential for complex verification tasks. This is where the human element becomes indispensable. Trained human verifiers can assess situations that are too ambiguous for AI, provide a final layer of scrutiny, and handle edge cases with empathy and judgment. The Billions Network funding will enable the expansion and refinement of both these crucial components, ensuring a robust and reliable verification service. This balanced approach ensures high accuracy rates while maintaining efficiency, a balance often sought but rarely achieved in the digital identity space. What Does This Funding Mean for the Future of Digital Identity? The successful Billions Network funding round has profound implications for the future of digital identity, especially within the rapidly expanding Web3 ecosystem. A reliable, decentralized identity solution is often cited as a missing piece for mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies. Billions Network’s focus on verifiable human and AI interactions could provide this crucial infrastructure. Imagine a future where: Decentralized applications can confidently verify user identities without compromising privacy. NFT marketplaces are protected from bot manipulation and fake accounts. Online communities can foster genuine engagement, free from spam and malicious actors. Financial transactions are more secure due to enhanced identity verification. This Billions Network funding is a step towards making this vision a widespread reality, fostering a safer and more trustworthy digital world. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead for Billions Network Funding While the Billions Network funding is a massive boost, the journey ahead will not be without its challenges. Scaling a global verification network, ensuring regulatory compliance across diverse jurisdictions, and continuously innovating to stay ahead of sophisticated fraudsters are significant hurdles.

The total addressable market for digital identity and verification services is growing exponentially, driven by the increasing digitalization of every aspect of life. With robust Billions Network funding and a unique hybrid approach, Billions Network is well-positioned to become a leader in this critical sector. Its mobile-first strategy also aligns perfectly with global trends, making its services accessible to a vast user base. A visual representation of Billions Network’s secure AI and human verification process, showing data flowing securely.

Pelosi’s wealth surge fuels scrutiny amid calls for tighter legislative ethics rules. Honest Act advances in Senate, aiming to halt stock trading by lawmakers and spouses. President Donald Trump has voiced strong support for banning members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks. The White House emphasized this during a Thursday briefing, framing the initiative as a critical move to curb unethical financial gains by lawmakers. Trump Administration Targets Pelosi’s Record In its push for reform, the Trump administration has singled out former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a central figure in the debate.

The White House noted that despite a congressional salary of $174,000, Pelosi’s net worth has reportedly grown to approximately $413 million.

The next crypto to hit $1 could well be Mutuum Finance (MUTM), driven by its unique utility and growing demand. Dogecoin’s resurgent momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a bullish turnaround in 2025. During a recent downturn, whales quickly accumulated 130 million tokens, driving the price to $0.2289. Technical indicators that point to a possible reversal include a double bottom formation on 4-hour cryptocurrency charts. The resistance level at $0.30 is still a significant obstacle, but the $0.2250 support level is holding steady. Trader optimism is being fueled by an increase in trading volume. The Relative Strength Index at 53 indicates neutral but slightly bullish momentum. If Dogecoin breaks the $0.30 neckline, analysts project a climb toward $0.5. However, a bearish MACD crossover hints at risks if momentum falters. Consequently, Dogecoin’s trajectory depends on sustaining this whale-driven push, transitioning attention to emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance’s presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor interest in Phase 6 of its 11-phase presale. Tokens are priced at $0.035, a 250% rise from the $0.01 opening phase. Over $13,800,000 has been raised, with 660 million tokens sold to 14,700 holders. Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, and the window to buy at this price is closing. Phase 7 will bring a 14.3% price increase to $0.04, with the launch price set at $0.06, ensuring a 71% ROI for current buyers. A projected $1 post-launch target suggests a potential 28x return. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rewarding its top 50 holders with bonus tokens, further driving demand. This presale momentum underscores its growing appeal in the crypto market. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a dual-lending ecosystem combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models on a Layer-2 blockchain. This setup is reducing gas fees by up to 90%, enhancing affordability. Lenders can pool assets like BTC and ETH for stable 12% APY returns or accept memecoins like DOGE for higher-risk, 33% APY loans. The platform is introducing an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted only during loans and burned upon repayment, ensuring a $1 peg. Also, a beta testnet is nearing, allowing early users to test the DApp. Furthermore, the fixed 4 billion token supply supports long-term value growth, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a high-utility DeFi project. Robust security and community focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score, confirming no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts.

2025-08-01 08:05:11,49349638,1754035511,USDT Transfer: Massive $228 Million Inflow to Binance Sparks Market Buzz,"BitcoinWorld USDT Transfer: Massive $228 Million Inflow to Binance Sparks Market Buzz The cryptocurrency world often operates on a grand scale, with transactions that can shift millions, even hundreds of millions, of dollars in an instant. Recently, the crypto community was abuzz with news of a truly massive USDT transfer . Over 228 million USDT, valued at approximately $228 million, moved from an unknown wallet directly into Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This isn’t just a large sum; it’s a significant event that prompts many questions about market dynamics, whale behavior, and what such a substantial USDT transfer might signify for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Happened with This USDT Transfer? The details of this particular USDT transfer were brought to light by Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions. On a specific date, a transaction involving 228,341,879 USDT was recorded, originating from a wallet tagged as ‘unknown’ and concluding its journey on Binance. This kind of movement, especially involving a stablecoin like USDT and such a significant amount, naturally draws attention. It highlights the transparency of blockchain technology, where even anonymous movements leave a public record for all to see. Here’s a breakdown of the key facts about this USDT transfer : Amount Transferred: 228,341,879 USDT Approximate Value: $228 million Origin Wallet: Unknown Destination: Binance Exchange Reported By: Whale Alert Such a substantial USDT transfer to a major exchange like Binance can have various implications, from increasing liquidity to signaling potential market moves. Understanding these possibilities is crucial for anyone tracking the crypto market. Why Does a Large USDT Transfer to Binance Matter? A USDT transfer of this magnitude is not a common occurrence, and its implications ripple through the market. USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1. This stability makes it a preferred medium for large-scale transfers, allowing whales and institutions to move significant value without exposure to crypto price volatility. When such a large amount lands on an exchange, it typically indicates a preparation for action. Consider these points regarding the impact of a large USDT transfer : Increased Liquidity: A large inflow of USDT means Binance has more stablecoin reserves, which can facilitate larger trading volumes for various cryptocurrencies. Potential Buying Pressure: Whales often move stablecoins to exchanges when they intend to buy other cryptocurrencies. This could signal an upcoming accumulation phase, potentially leading to upward price pressure. Potential Selling Pressure: Conversely, the USDT could be moved to facilitate the sale of other crypto assets, converting them into a stable asset. This is less likely if the funds originate from an ‘unknown’ wallet and are moving *to* an exchange. Arbitrage Opportunities: Large transfers can sometimes be related to exploiting price differences between exchanges. OTC Deals: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks on exchanges often handle large block trades that don’t directly impact the public order book, and this USDT transfer could be a precursor to such a deal. Understanding USDT: The Backbone of Large Crypto Transfers To fully grasp the significance of this USDT transfer , it’s important to understand what USDT is and why it’s so widely used. USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. This stability makes it an indispensable tool in the volatile crypto market. Traders use USDT to: Hedge Against Volatility: Convert volatile cryptocurrencies into USDT during market downturns without cashing out to fiat. Facilitate Trading: Many trading pairs on exchanges are denominated in USDT, making it a common base currency. Execute Large Transfers: As seen with this transaction, USDT enables the efficient and stable movement of large sums across different exchanges or wallets. The reliability and widespread acceptance of USDT make it the go-to asset for large-scale financial maneuvers within the crypto ecosystem, including significant movements like this recent USDT transfer . Who Are Crypto Whales and What Do They Do with a USDT Transfer? In the crypto world, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. Their large holdings mean their transactions, like this massive USDT transfer , can significantly influence market sentiment and price action. Whales are often sophisticated investors, institutions, or early adopters who have accumulated vast wealth in crypto. When a whale executes a large USDT transfer to an exchange, it’s a strong signal that they are preparing for a major move. This could be: Whale Activity Potential Motivation for USDT Transfer Accumulation Preparing to buy a large amount of Bitcoin or altcoins. Distribution Moving funds to facilitate large sales of other assets, though less common for inflows. Market Making Providing liquidity for trading pairs, earning from bid-ask spreads. OTC Trading Settling large, private trades outside the open market. Tracking these whale movements, particularly a substantial USDT transfer , provides a glimpse into the intentions of major market players, offering valuable, albeit speculative, insights. Analyzing Potential Motives Behind This Specific USDT Transfer While the exact intentions behind this 228 million USDT transfer remain unknown, we can speculate on several common motives for such large movements: Is it a Sign of Impending Purchases? One of the most common interpretations of a large stablecoin inflow to an exchange is that the holder intends to purchase other cryptocurrencies. If a whale believes the market is at a good entry point, they might move significant stablecoin reserves to an exchange to capitalize on potential price increases. This could signal a bullish outlook from a major player, suggesting they are ‘buying the dip’ or positioning themselves for an anticipated rally. Could it be Related to Arbitrage or Exchange Operations? Another possibility is that the USDT transfer is part of an arbitrage strategy. Differences in asset prices across various exchanges can create opportunities for profit. A whale might move USDT to an exchange where a particular asset is cheaper, buy it, and then transfer it to another exchange where it can be sold at a higher price. Alternatively, this could be an internal transfer by Binance itself, or a large market maker, adjusting liquidity across their various wallets or preparing for operational needs. Given the ‘unknown wallet’ tag, it is more likely an external entity. What About OTC Deals? Large institutional or high-net-worth individual trades often occur off-exchange through OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices. A significant USDT transfer to an exchange could be the initial step in settling such a private deal. For instance, an institution might have agreed to purchase a large block of Bitcoin, and this USDT is being moved to Binance’s OTC desk to facilitate the transaction. These deals do not typically show up on public order books, making the inbound stablecoin movement the only visible sign. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Following a Large USDT Transfer While a single USDT transfer doesn’t guarantee future market movements, it provides data points that informed traders and investors consider. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Follow-Up Transactions: Keep an eye on the destination exchange (Binance in this case) for subsequent large trades involving the transferred USDT. If it’s used to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum, it could indicate a bullish sentiment. Assess Market Context: Consider the broader market conditions. Is the market currently consolidating, in a downtrend, or showing signs of recovery? A large USDT transfer can be interpreted differently depending on the prevailing market sentiment. Risk Management: Do not make investment decisions solely based on one whale transaction. Always conduct your own research, understand the risks, and use proper risk management strategies. Whale movements are indicators, not guarantees. Liquidity Impact: Understand that increased USDT liquidity on an exchange can make it easier for large orders to be filled without causing significant price slippage. Challenges in Interpreting an Unknown USDT Transfer Despite the insights we can glean, there are inherent challenges in definitively interpreting a USDT transfer from an unknown wallet. The anonymity of blockchain addresses means we cannot definitively identify the sender or their precise intentions. This leaves room for speculation and multiple interpretations. Furthermore, not every large transfer leads to immediate, dramatic market shifts. Whales might move funds in anticipation of events that don’t materialize, or their plans might change. Therefore, while tracking such movements is valuable for understanding potential market forces, it should always be part of a broader analytical framework. Concluding Thoughts on the Massive USDT Transfer The recent 228 million USDT transfer to Binance is a compelling reminder of the significant capital flows within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the exact motives of the ‘unknown’ sender remain a mystery, such a large stablecoin movement typically signals preparations for major market activity. Whether it’s a precursor to significant buying, an OTC deal, or an arbitrage opportunity, these whale movements provide valuable, albeit speculative, clues about the intentions of large market participants. Staying informed about these large transactions helps us understand the underlying dynamics of the crypto market, even as we acknowledge the inherent uncertainties. A visual representation of the $228 million USDT transfer. USDT Transfer: Massive $228 Million Inflow to Binance Sparks Market Buzz Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a USDT transfer? A USDT transfer refers to the movement of Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, from one cryptocurrency wallet or exchange address to another. These transfers are recorded on a blockchain and can involve varying amounts, from small sums to hundreds of millions of dollars. Why are large USDT transfers significant? Large USDT transfers are significant because they often indicate major financial maneuvers by ‘whales’ – large holders of cryptocurrency. Such movements can precede large buying or selling activities, arbitrage opportunities, or institutional trades, potentially impacting market liquidity and price action. Does a large USDT transfer always mean a market pump or dump? No, a large USDT transfer does not automatically guarantee a market pump (price increase) or dump (price decrease). While it often signals an intention for major trading activity, the exact outcome depends on the whale’s specific strategy, broader market conditions, and whether the funds are used for buying, selling, or other purposes like OTC deals or liquidity provision. How can I track large USDT transfers? You can track large USDT transfers using blockchain explorers or dedicated whale tracking services like Whale Alert. These platforms monitor public blockchain data and report significant transactions, providing insights into large movements of various cryptocurrencies, including USDT. What is Binance’s role in a USDT transfer of this size? Binance, as one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, serves as a primary destination for such a massive USDT transfer. It acts as a hub where users can convert stablecoins into other cryptocurrencies, facilitate large trades (including OTC), and manage their digital assets, providing the necessary liquidity and infrastructure for these significant transactions.

2025-08-01 08:00:43,49349422,1754035243,"If Dogecoin Loses This Level, Expect A Major Crash: Analyst Warns","A widely followed chartist says Dogecoin’s latest rally has run into textbook resistance and the memecoin now sits on a make-or-break support band that will determine whether momentum resumes or unwinds. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) published a daily chart on X on July 31, 2025, showing DOGE pulling back to roughly the $0.22 area after a rejection beneath $0.28. Dogecoin Must Hold This Key Zone “Dogecoin holders as you can see DOGE came up to the macro golden pocket at the major resistance of .26-.28 cents and saw a rejection similar to the rest of the altcoins market after a really nice move,” he wrote, adding that price is “retesting the big support zone you want to hold… .213-.189 is all of your major daily MA’s, weekly bull market support band and the 0.5 FIB. Hold that zone and all is well Doge will end up bouncing higher. Fail it then your going back down into the shadow realm at the .14-.12 cents level.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Breakout Above Key Trendline-Will Momentum Hold Or Fade? The accompanying chart—set to the one-day timeframe—depicts DOGE’s advance into the $0.26–$0.28 “macro golden pocket,” a term traders typically use for the 61.8%–65% Fibonacci retracement cluster that often caps counter-trend moves. Kevin’s map highlights how the rejection there coincides with a dense shelf of historical supply and a clearly defined horizontal resistance band dating back to prior distribution. The subsequent slide has brought DOGE back into a breadth of confluent supports: a cluster of key daily moving averages, the analyst’s “weekly bull market support band,” and the 50% retracement of the prior swing, all stacked between $0.213 and $0.189. Confluence of this kind—multiple widely watched signals occupying the same price zone—often becomes a battleground; a decisive defense can restore trend structure, while a breach can accelerate liquidations. Community responses pressed the analyst on consistency and risk framing. One user, @SmRatul1994, challenged the shift in tone: “You just said Doge was very well positioned a couple weeks ago. Now you’re saying the opposite which things change so quickly?” Kevin replied that his guidance has been contextual and level-driven rather than directional at all costs. “I remember telling people to take profits at .40+ cents in December a buy at .14 cents twice this year both of which produced 70+% gains and I also remember telling people to take profits at the highs both times. Don’t cry in the casino buddy. I have been saying BTC and the Altcoin market was at major resistance for over a week now,” he said. Related Reading: Dogecoin Just Flashed A Rare Weekly Bullish Signal — This Analyst Is Buying Another commenter, @anthonyzamanz, noted the market’s correlation to Bitcoin—“Also all depend where Bitcoin will go…”—to which Kevin answered, “yes sir,” underscoring the top-down dependency altcoins retain on BTC’s path. When a separate user quipped, “To summarize, dogecoin will go up, if not it will go down,” Kevin distilled the thesis back to the levels: “Hold those levels and go up if not go down. You almost had it.” In practical terms, the roadmap laid out is binary and technical. A sustained bid inside $0.213–$0.189 would argue for continuation, potentially setting up another attempt at the $0.26–$0.28 range that capped the recent push. Losing that band on convincing volume and closing structure would, in Kevin’s words, open the “shadow realm” below, with $0.14–$0.12 flagged as the next major demand pocket. For now, the chart places DOGE squarely at confluence, with bulls tasked to convert the moving-average cluster and mid-range Fibonacci support into a durable base before any serious discussion of upside resumes. As ever in altcoin cycles, the analyst and several respondents emphasized that Bitcoin’s behavior will likely arbitrate the outcome. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.205.

Navigating On-Chain Trading with Binance Alpha: What You Need to Know One of the key features of Binance Alpha is its seamless integration with Binance Wallet and Exchange, facilitating on-chain trading directly. This means users can engage with these early-stage tokens without needing to navigate complex external decentralized exchanges or transfer assets between multiple platforms. Here’s how it benefits users: Simplified Process: Trading is streamlined, reducing the steps and potential for errors often associated with decentralized trading. Enhanced Security: Leveraging the security infrastructure of Binance Wallet, users can trade with greater peace of mind. Direct Access to Liquidity: Being integrated with Binance Exchange means users benefit from its deep liquidity, leading to more efficient trades. However, it’s important to remember that ""on-chain trading"" still involves network fees (gas fees) and transaction confirmations, which can vary based on network congestion. Understanding these aspects is crucial for a smooth trading experience on Binance Alpha . Benefits for Both Investors and Projects on Binance Alpha The existence of a platform like Binance Alpha creates a symbiotic relationship, offering significant advantages to both the investors seeking opportunities and the projects aiming for growth.

Diversification: Access to a new class of assets that might not be available on mainstream exchanges yet, allowing for portfolio diversification. Vetted Opportunities: While early-stage investments carry risks, Binance Alpha’s selection process provides a layer of initial vetting, potentially reducing some of the speculative elements. For Projects: Global Exposure: Immediate access to Binance’s massive global user base, providing unparalleled visibility. Liquidity & Capital: The ability to attract early investors and build liquidity, essential for project development and market stability.

Ecosystem Integration: Potential for deeper integration within the broader Binance ecosystem, opening doors for future collaborations and growth. Potential Risks and Considerations for Binance Alpha Users While Binance Alpha presents exciting opportunities, it’s vital to approach early-stage crypto investments with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. The crypto market, especially for new projects, is highly volatile. Users should consider the following: High Volatility: Prices of new tokens can fluctuate wildly in short periods, leading to significant gains or losses. Project Risk: Early-stage projects may fail to meet their development goals, face technical challenges, or lack sustained market interest. Liquidity Risk: While Binance Alpha aims to provide liquidity, very new tokens might still have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell large quantities without impacting price. Market Conditions: The overall crypto market sentiment can heavily influence the performance of individual tokens, regardless of their intrinsic value. It is always recommended to conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and invest only what you can afford to lose. Understanding the whitepaper, team, technology, and long-term vision of any project, including those on Binance Alpha , is paramount.

2025-08-01 07:55:11,49349213,1754034911,USDT Circulation: Resurgent Stablecoin Activity Signals Market Revival,"BitcoinWorld USDT Circulation: Resurgent Stablecoin Activity Signals Market Revival The crypto world is often characterized by its dynamic shifts and constant evolution. After a period of significant market volatility in early 2022, a key indicator is now painting a picture of renewed optimism and stability: the remarkable recovery in USDT circulation . This resurgence, highlighted by on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode, suggests a strengthening foundation for market activity and liquidity. What Does the Resurgent USDT Circulation Signify? According to recent insights from Glassnode, the 30-day moving average of USDT transfer volume has recently tapped an impressive $52.9 billion. This figure is more than just a statistic; it serves as a powerful barometer for the health and vibrancy of the stablecoin market. The transfer volume represents the total value of USDT moved across various blockchain networks within a specific period, indicating how actively the stablecoin is being used for transactions, trading, and other financial operations. A higher transfer volume and increased USDT circulation generally point to several positive trends within the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Enhanced Liquidity: More USDT moving means greater ease for traders to enter and exit positions, reducing slippage and improving overall market efficiency. Increased Trading Activity: Stablecoins like USDT are fundamental for trading pairs on exchanges. A rise in their circulation often correlates with heightened trading volumes across various cryptocurrencies. Restored Market Confidence: After periods of uncertainty, a recovery in stablecoin activity suggests that market participants are regaining trust and are more willing to hold and transact with these pegged assets. Growth in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): USDT is a cornerstone of many DeFi protocols. Increased circulation can signal a renewed interest and participation in lending, borrowing, and other DeFi applications. This recovery indicates that the circulation speed and overall market activity of stablecoins are steadily returning to more robust levels, reflecting a healthier market environment. How Are Different Blockchains Contributing to USDT Circulation? The distribution of this substantial USDT circulation across various blockchain networks offers crucial insights into the evolving landscape of stablecoin adoption. From January to May of the current year, two major players have clearly dominated the scene, showcasing their unique strengths in facilitating USDT transfers: Blockchain Network USDT Transfer Volume Share (Jan-May) Key Advantages for USDT Transactions Tron Over 55% Low transaction fees, high transaction throughput, fast confirmation times, making it ideal for frequent transfers. Ethereum Over 27% Robust and established decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, broad exchange support, strong security, and wide developer community. Tron’s leading position is largely attributed to its design, which prioritizes speed and affordability, making it highly attractive for everyday transactions and arbitrage opportunities. Ethereum, despite its often higher gas fees, maintains a significant share due to its foundational role in the DeFi space and its extensive network of dApps and integrations. The continued dominance of these two networks underscores their importance in facilitating global USDT circulation and highlights the diverse needs of stablecoin users. Benefits of Robust USDT Circulation for the Crypto Ecosystem The health of USDT circulation directly impacts the broader cryptocurrency market in several beneficial ways: Market Stability: As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDT provides a safe haven during market volatility. Its active circulation helps in price discovery and reduces extreme fluctuations. Enhanced Trading Opportunities: With abundant USDT available, traders can quickly move in and out of positions, facilitating faster execution of strategies and improving market efficiency. This leads to tighter spreads and better pricing on exchanges. Arbitrage Efficiency: The ability to quickly transfer large volumes of USDT across different exchanges and networks allows for efficient arbitrage, helping to equalize prices across various platforms. Gateway for New Entrants: For many new users, stablecoins like USDT serve as the initial entry point into the crypto market, providing a familiar dollar-pegged asset before venturing into more volatile cryptocurrencies. Fueling DeFi Growth: USDT is a primary asset used in decentralized lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision protocols. Robust circulation ensures these protocols have sufficient capital, fostering innovation and expansion within DeFi. What Challenges Might Impact Future USDT Circulation? While the recovery in USDT circulation is a positive sign, it is important to acknowledge potential challenges that could influence its future trajectory. The stablecoin market operates within a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. Governments and financial bodies worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing stablecoins, with new regulations like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) in Europe setting precedents. These regulatory shifts could impose stricter compliance requirements, potentially affecting how USDT is issued, transferred, and utilized. Competition from other stablecoins also remains a significant factor. While USDT holds the largest market share, competitors like USDC, BUSD, and DAI are continuously vying for market adoption by offering different features, audit processes, or decentralized governance models. User preference can shift based on factors such as perceived transparency, security, or integration with specific ecosystems. Furthermore, the underlying blockchain networks themselves present considerations. While Tron offers low fees, and Ethereum is foundational for DeFi, issues like network congestion, scalability limitations, or potential security vulnerabilities could impact the efficiency and reliability of USDT circulation on these platforms. Although less frequent, concerns about stablecoin peg stability, even for a robust asset like USDT, can periodically arise and influence market sentiment. Actionable Insights for Market Participants Understanding the dynamics of USDT circulation offers valuable insights for anyone involved in the crypto space: Monitor On-Chain Data: Platforms like Glassnode provide invaluable real-time data that can help you gauge market sentiment and activity. Keeping an eye on stablecoin transfer volumes can offer early signals of market shifts. Strategize Network Use: When transferring USDT, consider the trade-offs between different networks. For frequent, low-cost transactions, Tron might be preferred. For deep DeFi integrations and broader ecosystem access, Ethereum remains a strong choice. Diversify Stablecoin Holdings: While USDT is dominant, exploring other reputable stablecoins can mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single asset and offer access to different blockchain ecosystems. Stay Informed on Regulations: The regulatory environment for stablecoins is dynamic. Keeping abreast of new policies and frameworks can help you anticipate potential impacts on market access and usage. Conclusion The gradual recovery in USDT circulation , as evidenced by Glassnode’s data, marks a significant positive development for the cryptocurrency market. The surge in transfer volume to $52.9 billion signifies not just increased activity but also a growing confidence and liquidity within the stablecoin ecosystem. With Tron and Ethereum leading the charge in facilitating these transfers, the market demonstrates a robust infrastructure supporting stablecoin utility. This recovery underscores the vital role stablecoins play in providing stability, liquidity, and accessibility within the volatile crypto landscape, paving the way for continued growth and innovation.

2025-08-01 07:54:51,49349174,1754034891,Senator Warren Presses US Banking Regulator Over Trump Family’s Crypto Business Links,"US Senator Elizabeth Warren, alongside Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ron Wyden, has urged the nation’s top banking regulator to investigate potential conflicts of interest involving the Trump family’s cryptocurrency ventures. Key Takeaways: Senators are pressing the OCC over Trump’s potential financial conflicts tied to the stablecoin USD1. USD1, launched by a Trump-linked platform, is central to a $2B deal involving MGX and Binance. Lawmakers warn the stablecoin poses an “unprecedented conflict of interest” tied to the presidency. In a letter sent Thursday to Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) head Jonathan Gould, the senators raised concerns about President Donald Trump’s “continued use of cryptocurrency business ventures to line their pockets.” The letter specifically questions how the OCC, now the primary regulator of stablecoins under the recently passed GENIUS Act, will safeguard the financial system against undue influence from Trump’s personal business interests. “The bill does nothing to prevent President Trump, his family, or his affiliates from financially benefiting from the issuance and sale of stablecoins,” the senators wrote. Trump-Linked Stablecoin USD1 at Center of Senate Inquiry, Warren Says The focus of the inquiry is USD1, a stablecoin launched in March 2024 by World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform linked to the Trump family. The senators argue Trump’s financial interests are “intricately tied” to the stablecoin’s success, creating what they describe as “an unprecedented conflict of interest.” “The launch of a stablecoin directly tied to a sitting President who stands to benefit financially from the stablecoin’s success presents significant threats to our financial system,” the letter said. The controversy deepened with revelations of a $2 billion deal involving Emirati firm MGX and Binance, using USD1 to facilitate the investment. The senators called it “a staggering model for corruption,” highlighting that Binance, which pleaded guilty to U.S. anti-money laundering violations, also helped develop USD1’s code. The letter ends with a demand for transparency, asking if Gould believes he serves at the President’s pleasure and whether he would step down if pressured. Reminder: Trump is pushing for crypto legislation to keep lining his own pocket. President Bush's former ethics lawyer says we have never had a president since the Civil War with such a conflict of interest. We should not pass any crypto legislation without shutting this down. pic.twitter.com/GIIv9UapZc — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) July 10, 2025 It also urges the OCC to consider an investigation into World Liberty’s competitors, with responses requested by August 14. USD1 currently ranks as the world’s seventh-largest stablecoin, with a market cap of $2.17 billion, ahead of offerings from PayPal and Ripple, according to CoinGecko. Trump’s Crypto Holdings Make Up Key Portion of His Fortune Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth . Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates that TMTG stock represents $2.2 billion of Trump’s $6.6 billion fortune. His broader cryptocurrency investments are believed to have gained at least $620 million in recent months. However, the move is raising concerns among some industry figures. Nick Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures and a Trump supporter, said the overlap between Trump’s political influence and his financial exposure to crypto markets could create a conflict of interest. “It’s always a headache to have businesses with conflicting interests,” he told Bloomberg.

2025-08-01 07:53:12,49349171,1754034792,"Crypto Hack Losses Jump 27% in July to $142M, Led by CoinDCX and GMX","Crypto hack losses jumped 27.2% to $142 million in July 2025, up from $111.6 million in June, as seventeen major security breaches targeted exchanges and DeFi protocols, according to PeckShield data. Indian exchange CoinDCX suffered the month’s largest attack at $44.2 million through insider involvement, while GMX lost $42 million in a re-entrancy exploit before recovering funds through a white-hat agreement. Source: PeckShield CoinDCX Breach Exposes Insider Threat Through Employee Compromise The CoinDCX attack on July 19 resulted from compromised login credentials belonging to software engineer Rahul Agarwal, who was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the $44 million theft. Police investigations revealed that Agarwal used his company laptop for freelance work, receiving a WhatsApp call from Germany about a file completion that likely contained malicious code. The breach occurred at 2:37 AM when an unknown person accessed the system and transferred 1 USDT to test the connection. A CoinDCX employee was found using the company laptop for freelance jobs, which led hackers to exploit login credentials to siphon $44 million in crypto. #CoinDCX #CryptoHack #IndianCryptoExchange https://t.co/0EivOLdqEJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 At 9:40 AM, hackers siphoned $44 million and distributed funds across six wallets, according to police statements from Neblio Technologies vice-president Hardeep Singh. Cybersecurity experts from Cyvers linked the exploit to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, noting similarities to the $234 million WazirX hack in 2024. The attack pattern involved systematic fund extraction and immediate distribution to multiple addresses to complicate recovery efforts. Agarwal admitted during interrogation that he received approximately $17,131 in his bank account from unknown sources over the past year, claiming the payments came from part-time work. The incident coincided with acquisition rumors involving Coinbase , which CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta later denied. GMX Recovers $40.5M After Re-Entrancy Vulnerability Exploitation GMX suffered a $42 million exploit on July 9 through a re-entrancy vulnerability in its V1 contracts that bypassed the nonReentrant modifier. The attacker manipulated BTC average short prices through the Vault contract, artificially inflating GLP token values before redeeming them for profit using flash loans. The exploiter agreed to a white-hat deal , returning approximately $40.5 million, including 10,000 ETH and 10.5 million FRAX tokens, while keeping a $5 million bounty. However, the remaining $32 million was converted to 11,700 ETH, generating an additional $3 million profit due to Ethereum price appreciation. GMX paused trading on Avalanche and disabled GLP minting on Arbitrum pending user reimbursement procedures. The GMX exploiter agrees to return $42M in stolen assets for a $5M white-hat bounty, per @lookonchain #GMX #DeFi https://t.co/RXjQ9IiH7k — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 11, 2025 The protocol confirmed that V1 positions would be wound down and migrated to a reimbursement pool, while warning all V1 forks to implement immediate security fixes. Other significant July breaches included BigONE exchange losing $28 million through supply chain compromise, WOO X suffering $12 million in losses from a targeted phishing attack, and Future Protocol losing $4.2 million. BigONE’s production network was compromised when attackers modified server logic for account operations and risk controls. The July surge continues 2025’s devastating security trend, with crypto investors losing over $2.2 billion in the first half through 344 incidents . Wallet-related breaches accounted for $1.7 billion across 34 attacks, while phishing attacks stole $410 million in 132 separate incidents. Crypto investors have lost $2.2B to hacks and scams in H1 2025, with $187M recovered as threats shift, reports @CertiK . #CryptoSecurity #Cryptohacks https://t.co/5KCaVsYnbg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 30, 2025 Physical violence against crypto holders escalated alongside digital attacks, with 32 “wrench attacks” reported globally in 2025, putting the year on pace to exceed 2021’s record of 36 violent incidents. Nearly one-third occurred in France, where attackers increasingly target family members of cryptocurrency holders. The average loss per incident reached $7.1 million with a median of $90,000, while recovery efforts returned $187 million through law enforcement, white-hat arrangements, and exchange cooperation. Despite partial recoveries, net losses for 2025’s first half totaled approximately $2.29 billion, already exceeding all of 2024’s crypto security losses.

Popular crypto commentator Altcoin Daily shared the development in a tweet. The expansion comes less than four years after Cardano introduced smart contract functionality to its mainnet through the Alonzo hard fork. That hard fork rolled out the Plutus smart contract language on the Cardano mainnet. Since then, the number of contracts deployed on the mainnet has surpassed 300,000. Fresh data from the Cardano blockchain insight platform Alethea shows that the total number of live smart contracts on the mainnet now stands at 300,490. Simple Scripts has contributed 163,300 smart contracts, while Plutus V1 and V2 scripts have deployed 7,000 and 124,990 contracts, respectively, on the Cardano mainnet. However, the Plutus V3, which was introduced to the mainnet in August 2024, has added 5,200 smart contracts to the blockchain, according to Alethea data. Cardano live smart contracts Cardano live smart contracts New Milestone Signals Increased Developer Activity For context, smart contracts are self-executing agreements on a blockchain created through lines of code. Based on the nature of smart contracts, they execute actions automatically following the terms of the said agreement without the involvement of an intermediary. Notably, developers have leveraged the smart contract functionality to create decentralized applications (dApps) interacting with the blockchain. Therefore, crossing the 300,000 milestone signals increased developer activity on the Cardano mainnet. Steady Smart Contract Growth Since Vasil Hard Fork Meanwhile, the development arm of the Cardano project has introduced several upgrades to enhance the network’s smart contract functionality over the years. This was evident following the rollout of the Vasil hard fork in September 2022. The upgrade improved the Plutus smart contract language, making it more efficient and cost-effective for developers to deploy dApps on the mainnet. Before the launch of Vasil, the number of contracts on the Cardano mainnet was around 63,490, with Plutus V1 Scripts accounting for 2,900 of this sum, as of July 11, 2022. However, the figure has soared to above 300,000 as of today, marking an increase of 373.28% over three years. In 2024 alone, nearly 100,000 smart contracts were added to the Cardano network.

2025-08-01 07:50:10,49349000,1754034610,Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold $3.7 Billion Move for Unprecedented Accumulation,"BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold $3.7 Billion Move for Unprecedented Accumulation In a groundbreaking move that underscores the growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Metaplanet, a Japan-listed company, is making headlines with its ambitious Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm recently announced a significant proposal to issue perpetual preferred shares, aiming to raise a staggering ¥555 billion ($3.7 billion) to bolster its Bitcoin treasury. This strategic maneuver is not just a ripple but a potential tidal wave in the corporate adoption of Bitcoin, signaling a bold commitment to the future of finance. What is Metaplanet’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation Plan? Metaplanet’s proposed issuance of perpetual preferred shares represents a pivotal step in its long-term vision. The company, already recognized for embracing Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, revealed its intent to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to secure approval for this substantial capital raise. This initiative is directly aligned with their previously stated goal of accumulating an impressive 210,000 BTC by 2027. Strategic Funding: The ¥555 billion ($3.7 billion) shelf registration provides a flexible framework for Metaplanet to issue preferred shares, enabling them to raise capital over time as market conditions are favorable. Long-Term Vision: Unlike short-term trading, Metaplanet’s strategy is focused on long-term accumulation, positioning Bitcoin as a foundational asset for future growth and stability. Transparency and Governance: Holding an EGM demonstrates a commitment to corporate governance, involving shareholders in this significant strategic shift. This proactive approach to funding its Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy distinguishes the company, setting a precedent for how traditional corporations can integrate digital assets into their core financial operations. Why is Metaplanet Embracing Bitcoin as a Core Asset? Metaplanet’s decision to pivot towards Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset is rooted in several compelling macroeconomic and financial considerations. It reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations seeking alternatives to traditional fiat currencies and conventional investment vehicles. Reason for Bitcoin Adoption Explanation Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential safeguard against currency debasement and rising inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Digital Gold Narrative Increasingly viewed as a store of value, similar to gold, but with the added benefits of digital portability and divisibility. Long-Term Growth Potential Belief in Bitcoin’s continued appreciation as adoption grows and its network effects strengthen, offering significant capital gains potential. Diversification Provides diversification away from traditional financial assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk in volatile markets. This strategic rationale aligns with other pioneering companies like MicroStrategy, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Metaplanet’s embrace of Metaplanet Bitcoin is a testament to a growing conviction that digital assets are not just speculative ventures but essential components of a modern, resilient corporate treasury. How Does Preferred Stock Issuance Support Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Vision? The choice of perpetual preferred shares as a funding mechanism is crucial to understanding Metaplanet’s long-term strategy. Preferred shares typically offer a fixed dividend payment and have priority over common stock in receiving dividends and assets in case of liquidation. Perpetual means they have no maturity date, providing a continuous source of capital without the need for repayment of principal. Non-Dilutive for Common Shareholders (Initially): While preferred shares do represent ownership, they do not typically carry voting rights and are distinct from common equity, potentially reducing immediate dilution concerns for existing common shareholders. Stable Capital Source: Perpetual nature provides long-term, stable funding for ongoing Bitcoin accumulation, reducing reliance on volatile operational cash flows. Investor Appeal: Preferred shares can appeal to investors seeking fixed income or stable returns, attracting a different pool of capital than traditional equity or debt. This financing method allows Metaplanet to acquire significant amounts of Bitcoin without immediately diluting the ownership stake of its existing common shareholders. It’s a sophisticated financial engineering approach to fund a cutting-edge digital asset strategy, further solidifying the company’s commitment to its Metaplanet Bitcoin vision. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy Every bold strategy comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges. Metaplanet’s move into substantial Bitcoin accumulation is no exception. Understanding these facets is key to appreciating the full scope of their undertaking. Benefits: Potential for Significant Upside: If Bitcoin continues its long-term upward trajectory, Metaplanet stands to gain substantial value, potentially boosting its balance sheet significantly. Increased Visibility and Brand Recognition: Being a leading Bitcoin adopter in Japan enhances Metaplanet’s profile, attracting investors and talent interested in innovative financial strategies. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Moving away from traditional cash holdings offers a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, especially in an era of expansive monetary policies. Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant downturn could impact Metaplanet’s balance sheet and investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Future regulations in Japan or elsewhere could impact the feasibility or profitability of their strategy. Market Liquidity for Large Holdings: Accumulating and potentially liquidating 210,000 BTC is a massive undertaking that requires deep market liquidity to avoid significant price impact. Perpetual Share Burden: While offering stable capital, the perpetual dividend payments represent an ongoing financial commitment for the company, regardless of Bitcoin’s performance. Metaplanet is navigating these complexities with a clear long-term perspective, betting on Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. Their strategy reflects a calculated risk, aiming for substantial rewards by embracing the future of finance with Metaplanet Bitcoin . What Are the Implications for Japanese Corporations and Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s aggressive Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy could serve as a powerful catalyst for broader institutional adoption in Japan and potentially across Asia. Japan, a country with a sophisticated financial market and a history of technological innovation, has often been a bellwether for global trends. Metaplanet’s public commitment to Bitcoin could encourage other Japanese corporations to explore similar treasury strategies. Increased Institutional Interest: As a publicly traded company, Metaplanet’s success (or challenges) with Bitcoin will be closely watched, providing a real-world case study for other firms. Regulatory Clarity: Increased corporate adoption may prompt regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks for digital asset integration, fostering a more stable environment. Innovation in Corporate Finance: Metaplanet is demonstrating how innovative financing structures can be used to acquire and hold digital assets, potentially inspiring new financial products and services. The ripple effect of Metaplanet’s move could extend beyond treasury management, potentially influencing investment funds, pension funds, and even government policies regarding digital assets. This is not just about one company’s balance sheet; it’s about setting a precedent for a new era of corporate financial strategy in a major global economy. Metaplanet’s proposed $3.7 billion preferred stock issuance to fuel its Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy is a truly monumental development. It signifies a profound shift in how corporations view and utilize digital assets, moving them from speculative investments to core treasury components. With an ambitious target of 210,000 BTC by 2027, Metaplanet is positioning itself as a pioneer, demonstrating conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as an inflation hedge and a superior store of value. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain, the potential benefits—including significant capital appreciation and enhanced corporate resilience—are substantial. This bold move by a Japan-listed company could very well accelerate broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin, reshaping corporate finance strategies globally and cementing Bitcoin’s role in the future economy.

2025-08-01 07:49:00,49349094,1754034540,"Solana vs Binance Coin: Can SOL or BNB Flip XRP, Or Does This ‘XRP 2.0’ Contender Have A Better Chance?","Solana and Binance Coin (BNB) continue to battle it out for dominance in the altcoin market space, with traders guessing on whether either will catch up with XRP on market cap leaderboard positions. Traded at $177.15 for SOL and at $795.24 for BNB, though, is the question of whether a newer player—referred to by some as an “XRP 2.0″—might overtake them both. That player is Remittix , a fast-rising DeFi project now making headlines for its real-world use case and impending product launch. SOL and BNB Engage in Battle for Dominance as XRP Joins the Ranks Solana, Binance Coin, and XRP remain three of the most widely held crypto currencies, each with their own set of ecosystems. As BNB rises by 1.34% and Solana falls by 0.69%, investors are waiting for any shift in momentum in advancements. While BNB boasts a market capitalization of $110.8 billion, Solana remains consistent at $95.31 billion, just behind XRP. The trading volume paints a different picture. Solana’s trading volume is 4.96% higher at $5.63 billion, which means solid liquidity. The volume of Binance Coin is 19.5% down, which is an indication of short-term deceleration. As competition increases, DeFi strong project use cases and crypto having real utility are starting to steal limelight away. Can ‘XRP 2.0’ Be the Real Contender? Though the majority of the focus remains on top Layer 1 chains, Remittix is making a strong statement as a contender in the payments space. Unlike XRP, which is focused on financial institution-to-fFinancial institution transfers, Remittix (RTX) enables transfers from cryptocurrency to bank accounts directly for retail consumers in 30+ countries. For $0.0895 per token, the Remittix presale has picked up over $17.9 million in investment and sold more than 577 million tokens. That’s figures that show growing interest in leading crypto under $1 with practical, real-world functionality. It’s not a sales pitch—it’s backed by tech and an upcoming product launch.

2025-08-01 07:45:20,49348782,1754034320,Falcon Finance Has USDf Listed on VOOI’s Omnichain Perps and RWA Exchange,"August 1st, 2025 – Dubai, UAE Synthetic dollar protocol Falcon Finance has announced that USDf has been listed on VOOI’s omnichain perps and RWA exchange. The stablecoin can be used as a base currency for trading a range of real-world assets on VOOI, adding further utility to USDf and unlocking new opportunities for its holders. The listing of USDf on VOOI’s perps and RWA marketplace will deepen the stablecoin’s liquidity and expand global access. It can now be utilized on VOOI to trade US markets including TSLA and $GOOG alongside other stocks and RWA assets. In addition, VOOI has revealed plans to integrate a USDf earn feature into its app, unlocking additional opportunities for holders to earn yield on their assets. VOOI’s perpetual DEX aggregator supports both EVM and non-EVM networks, using account abstraction to simplify leveraged trading across chains. It supports more than 200 markets and has generated over $10B in lifetime volume. By incorporating crypto, stocks, indices, and commodities into a single application, VOOI gives onchain traders access to a broad spectrum of assets. The integration of USDf into VOOI follows a $10M strategic investment in Falcon Finance from World Liberty Financial, developer of the USD1 stablecoin. The funding will accelerate Falcon’s technical integrations, with a focus on shared liquidity provisioning and multi-chain compatibility. Falcon has committed to developing smart contract modules that support seamless conversion between USDf and USD1. In addition, USD1 has been added as collateral on Falcon, expanding the range of stablecoins it holds in its treasury. USDf is rapidly becoming a versatile, multi-purpose asset as the number of DeFi integrations and exchange listings grows. On V2 of VOOI’s perps DEX aggregator, it will serve as a stable unit of account, allowing users to trade a broad range of real-world assets within a non-custodial framework. The total supply of USDf has risen sharply over the past month, almost doubling to reach $1.1B, backed by a TVL of $1.2B that includes BTC, altcoins, and stablecoins such as USD1. In the past week, Falcon has launched a Transparency Dashboard providing full transparency into the assets backing USDf. This displays a detailed breakdown of USDf reserves by asset type, custody provider, and the percentage held onchain. Demand for USDf has been driven by a string of integrations and listings including VOOI, coupled with heightened interest in the opportunities to earn yield through staking the stablecoin. sUSDf, the yield-bearing version of USDf, provides stakers with a variable APY that currently stands at 12.8%. About Falcon Finance Falcon Finance is a next-generation synthetic dollar protocol. Preserving users’ multi-assets with industry competitive yields across any market conditions, it sets a new standard in the industry, along with transparency, security, and institutional-grade risk management.

2025-08-01 07:45:11,49348846,1754034311,"Unlocking Opportunities: Binance Alpha Adds MIA, Revolutionizing Early-Stage Crypto Access","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Opportunities: Binance Alpha Adds MIA, Revolutionizing Early-Stage Crypto Access The cryptocurrency world is a rapidly evolving landscape, constantly presenting new frontiers for innovation and investment. For many, the thrill lies in discovering groundbreaking projects at their nascent stages, long before they become mainstream. This is precisely where platforms like Binance Alpha step in, offering a curated gateway to the next big thing in crypto. Recently, the excitement reached a new peak with the announcement that ai.ac (MIA) has been added to Binance Alpha , signaling a significant move for both the platform and the project. This addition, confirmed by the Binance Wallet X account on August 1st , underscores Binance Alpha ‘s commitment to showcasing promising early-stage crypto ventures and revolutionizing how users engage with them. What is Binance Alpha and How Does It Empower Innovation? Binance Alpha is not just another listing platform; it’s a dedicated initiative within the broader Binance ecosystem, specifically designed to identify and highlight early-stage cryptocurrency projects with high potential. Think of it as a launchpad for innovation, providing visibility and accessibility to projects that might otherwise struggle to gain traction in a crowded market. The platform’s selection process is rigorous, focusing on two primary criteria: Community Engagement: Projects that demonstrate a strong, active, and growing community are often prioritized. This indicates genuine interest and a solid foundation for future development. Emerging Market Trends: Binance Alpha keeps a keen eye on the pulse of the crypto market, identifying sectors and technologies that are gaining momentum. This ensures that the projects featured are relevant and aligned with future growth areas. One of the most compelling aspects of Binance Alpha is its seamless integration. It facilitates on-chain trading directly within the Binance Wallet and Exchange. This means users can discover, research, and trade these early-stage tokens without ever leaving the familiar and secure Binance environment, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for many. Why is MIA (ai.ac) a Significant Addition to Binance Alpha? The recent inclusion of ai.ac, known by its token symbol MIA, on Binance Alpha is a testament to the project’s perceived potential and its alignment with emerging market trends. While specific details about ai.ac’s underlying technology and use cases would typically be explored by users, its selection by a platform as discerning as Binance Alpha immediately confers a degree of credibility and visibility. For MIA, this means: Unprecedented Exposure: Gaining a spot on Binance Alpha means exposure to millions of Binance users worldwide, many of whom are actively seeking early investment opportunities. Enhanced Liquidity: Integration with Binance Wallet and Exchange can significantly boost MIA’s liquidity, making it easier for users to buy and sell the token. Validation: Being featured by a major player like Binance, even on a specialized platform like Alpha, serves as a strong validation of the project’s viability and potential. This strategic move by Binance Alpha not only benefits MIA but also reinforces Alpha’s reputation as a reliable source for discovering the next wave of crypto innovation. How Does Binance Alpha Benefit Crypto Enthusiasts? For the average crypto enthusiast, Binance Alpha presents a unique and valuable proposition. It addresses several common challenges faced when trying to engage with early-stage projects: Curated Access: Instead of sifting through countless unvetted projects, users get a curated list of tokens that have already passed Binance Alpha ‘s initial screening process. This doesn’t eliminate risk entirely, but it certainly streamlines the discovery phase. Convenience of On-Chain Trading: The ability to trade directly from the Binance Wallet means no complicated transfers to external decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This simplifies the process, making early-stage investing more accessible even for those less familiar with complex DeFi interactions. Potential for Early Adoption: Discovering projects like MIA on Binance Alpha before they hit broader markets offers the potential for significant returns if the projects succeed. This ‘early bird’ advantage is a major draw for many investors. The platform essentially acts as a bridge, connecting curious investors with innovative projects in a user-friendly and secure environment. What Advantages Does Binance Alpha Offer Emerging Projects? While users gain significant benefits, the advantages for emerging crypto projects featured on Binance Alpha are equally profound. For a nascent project, gaining visibility and legitimacy is paramount, and Binance Alpha provides just that: Massive User Base Access: Binance boasts the largest user base in the crypto world. Being featured on Binance Alpha instantly puts a project in front of millions of potential investors and users. Credibility and Trust: A listing on any Binance-affiliated platform lends immense credibility. It signals to the market that the project has undergone some level of vetting and meets certain standards, even if it’s still in its early stages. Liquidity and Market Depth: Direct integration with Binance’s trading infrastructure helps projects achieve better liquidity and market depth, which are crucial for stable price discovery and trading. Ecosystem Integration: Projects gain access to the broader Binance ecosystem, which can include potential collaborations, technical support, and further development opportunities. In essence, Binance Alpha acts as a powerful accelerator for promising crypto ventures, helping them to scale and gain adoption much faster than they might otherwise. Navigating the Exciting World of Early-Stage Crypto with Binance Alpha While Binance Alpha significantly streamlines the process of discovering early-stage projects, it’s crucial for users to approach these opportunities with a balanced perspective. Investing in nascent projects, by definition, carries higher risks compared to established cryptocurrencies. Here are some actionable insights for engaging responsibly: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always delve deeper than just the listing. Research the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community activity. Understand what problem the project aims to solve. Understand the Risks: Early-stage projects are often highly volatile and can experience significant price swings. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Start Small: Consider allocating a smaller portion of your portfolio to early-stage investments until you gain more experience and confidence. Stay Informed: Follow the project’s development, community updates, and market news. The crypto space moves fast, and staying informed is key. Binance Alpha provides the platform, but the responsibility for due diligence ultimately rests with the investor. It’s a tool to enhance discovery, not a guarantee of returns. Feature Benefit for Users Benefit for Projects Early Project Access Discover high-potential tokens before wider adoption Gain early exposure to a large, engaged user base On-Chain Trading Seamless, direct trading within Binance Wallet Increased liquidity and market access Curation & Vetting Reduced initial risk via selection criteria Enhanced credibility and trust from Binance association Ecosystem Integration Unified experience with Wallet & Exchange Access to Binance’s vast user base and infrastructure The Future Landscape: How Binance Alpha Shapes Crypto Discovery The role of platforms like Binance Alpha is becoming increasingly vital in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. As the market matures, the sheer volume of new projects can be overwhelming. A curated, accessible platform like Alpha acts as a filter, bringing forward projects that meet specific criteria for potential and community interest. This not only benefits individual investors but also contributes to the overall health of the crypto ecosystem by providing a clear path for promising innovations to gain traction. By integrating early-stage project discovery directly into its wallet and exchange, Binance is setting a precedent for how major platforms can foster innovation while maintaining user convenience and security. The addition of MIA is just one example of how Binance Alpha continues to expand its offerings, promising more exciting opportunities for crypto enthusiasts and a robust launching pad for future projects. In conclusion, Binance Alpha ‘s strategic addition of ai.ac (MIA) marks another significant step in its mission to democratize access to early-stage crypto opportunities.

After a recent decline, the token has increased by 2% over the last day. A 61% increase in trading volume suggests increased investor interest. Strong support is being given by technical indicators such as daily exponential moving averages. PEPE may move toward $0.00001600 if it breaks out over the resistance level of $0.00001300. However, its volatility requires cautious consideration compared to more structured projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance’s presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its 11-phase presale. The tokens are priced at $0.035. Moreover, the project has raised $13,800,000 since the presale began. It has garnered over 660 million tokens sold to 14,700 holders. Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, signaling that the opportunity to secure tokens at this price is diminishing. Phase 7 will bring a 14.3% price increase to $0.04, with a launch price of $0.06 ensuring a 71% return on investment for current buyers. Analysts are predicting a post-launch value of $2, potentially turning a $50 investment into $5,714. This structured growth is underpinned by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative DeFi model, setting it apart in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance’s innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending platform. The platform blends peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract models. This dual approach is maximizing capital efficiency. Thus, offering lenders high yields and borrowers flexible terms. The platform is introducing an overcollateralized stablecoin system, minted only during loans and burned upon repayment, ensuring stability in volatile crypto markets. Operating on a Layer-2 network, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reducing gas fees and boosting transaction speeds, enhancing accessibility. The fixed 4 billion token supply is supporting long-term value growth, driven by staking and buyback mechanisms. Additionally, the team is rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens via a newly launched dashboard, incentivizing loyalty. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a cornerstone for DeFi investors. Mutuum Finance’s security and community engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, achieving an impressive 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The project is bolstering trust through a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, rewarding discoveries across four severity tiers. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is generating excitement with a $100,000 giveaway , distributing $10,000 in tokens to each of 10 winners. Participation requires a $50 presale investment and completing specific quests, fostering community engagement. These initiatives are strengthening investor confidence. Thus, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout in crypto investment opportunities. Capitalizing on crypto opportunities The top cryptos to buy now, like PEPE and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are offering distinct paths to potentially turn $50 into $5,000. PEPE is capitalizing on short-term market momentum, with crypto charts signaling a breakout. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a sustainable DeFi ecosystem. This is with its presale success and robust tokenomics pointing to long-term gains. Investors are encouraged to explore these opportunities, particularly Mutuum Finance (MUTM), before its presale prices rise.

2025-08-01 07:40:10,49348581,1754034010,Shocking Jeffrey Huang Crypto Losses Revealed: A Deep Dive into Machi Big Brother’s $11.9M Unrealized Drawdown,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Jeffrey Huang Crypto Losses Revealed: A Deep Dive into Machi Big Brother’s $11.9M Unrealized Drawdown In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, even the most prominent figures are not immune to market fluctuations. Recently, attention has turned to Jeffrey Huang, a Taiwanese singer and influential figure in the NFT space, better known as Machi Big Brother. Reports indicate that Jeffrey Huang crypto positions are facing a significant challenge, highlighting the inherent volatility of digital assets. Who is Jeffrey Huang and Why Does His Crypto Matter? Jeffrey Huang, or Machi Big Brother, is not just a musician; he’s a well-known crypto whale, particularly famous for his extensive collection of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs. His moves in the crypto market are often tracked by observers, given his substantial holdings and influence. When a figure of his stature experiences a notable financial shift, it naturally draws attention and prompts discussions about market health and individual investment strategies. The recent news regarding his unrealized losses sheds light on the broader risks associated with large-scale crypto investments. His involvement in various crypto projects, including his association with the Bored Ape Yacht Club , has cemented his status as a key player. This makes any significant movement in his portfolio a topic of interest, not just for financial analysts but for the wider crypto community looking for insights into market trends and the fortunes of major investors. Understanding the $11.9 Million Unrealized Jeffrey Huang Crypto Loss According to data shared by @ai_9684xtpa on X, Jeffrey Huang is currently sitting on an unrealized loss of $11.9 million across several of his long positions. It’s crucial to understand what ‘unrealized loss’ means in this context. Unlike a realized loss, where an asset is sold at a lower price than its purchase price, an unrealized loss occurs when the current market value of an asset drops below its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. This means the loss is theoretical until the position is closed. The reported positions still hold a considerable total value of $148 million, indicating the sheer scale of his crypto portfolio. The primary contributors to this drawdown are identified as his holdings in ETH (Ethereum), HYPE, and PUMP. While ETH is a major cryptocurrency, HYPE and PUMP likely refer to smaller, more volatile altcoins or meme coins, which often exhibit extreme price swings. Asset Estimated Initial Value Current Value (Approx.) Unrealized Loss Contribution ETH Significant Portion Varies with Market Partial HYPE Substantial Lower Major Drawdown PUMP Substantial Lower Major Drawdown Total Portfolio (Current Value) $159.9 Million (Approx.) $148 Million $11.9 Million What Factors Contribute to Such Significant Drawdowns? The crypto market is known for its extreme volatility, and several factors can contribute to a large investor like Jeffrey Huang experiencing substantial unrealized losses: Market-Wide Corrections: Broader market downturns, often triggered by macroeconomic news, regulatory concerns, or shifts in investor sentiment, can drag down the prices of even established cryptocurrencies like ETH. Altcoin Volatility: HYPE and PUMP, likely smaller cap tokens, are inherently more volatile. They can experience rapid pumps based on speculation and equally swift dumps if sentiment shifts or initial hype fades. Concentrated Positions: Holding large, concentrated positions in a few assets, especially highly speculative ones, amplifies both potential gains and losses. While a diversified portfolio can cushion some blows, a whale’s strategy often involves significant bets on specific assets. Liquidity Issues: For very large positions in smaller tokens, selling a significant amount without impacting the price can be challenging, meaning even if an investor wanted to exit, they might face liquidity constraints that worsen their loss. Lessons from Jeffrey Huang Crypto Holdings: Actionable Insights for Investors The situation with Machi Big Brother’s portfolio offers valuable lessons for all crypto investors, regardless of their portfolio size: Understand Unrealized vs. Realized Losses: It’s vital to differentiate. An unrealized loss isn’t permanent until the asset is sold. Market recovery could turn these losses into gains. However, it’s also a warning sign that positions are underwater. Risk Management is Key: Even for whales, proper risk management is crucial. This includes setting stop-loss orders (though challenging for very large, illiquid positions), diversifying across different asset classes, and not over-allocating to highly speculative tokens. Beware of Hype Cycles: Tokens named ‘HYPE’ and ‘PUMP’ are almost self-explanatory indicators of speculative plays. While they can offer quick gains, they carry immense risk. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence beyond just market sentiment. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Views: For long-term holders, market downturns can be viewed as temporary corrections. However, for those looking for short-to-medium term gains, such drawdowns can be painful and necessitate a re-evaluation of strategy. Monitor Your Portfolio: Regularly reviewing the performance of your assets and understanding why they are moving (or not moving) is essential. Tools and analytics platforms can help track these changes. The crypto market is a dynamic environment, and even experienced participants face challenges. The unrealized Jeffrey Huang crypto loss serves as a potent reminder that while crypto offers immense potential, it also demands a disciplined and informed approach to investment. The Broader Impact: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Community? When a figure like Jeffrey Huang, closely associated with the NFT and broader crypto space, faces such a significant unrealized loss, it can have several ripple effects: Investor Sentiment: It might contribute to a cautious sentiment among retail investors, especially if they perceive that even ‘whales’ are struggling. This can lead to reduced trading activity or a flight to more stable assets. Market Narratives: It reinforces narratives about crypto volatility and risk, which can be both a deterrent for new entrants and a call for increased regulatory scrutiny. Learning Opportunity: More positively, it provides a real-world case study for market participants to analyze investment strategies, risk exposure, and the importance of holding power during downturns. Ultimately, the $11.9 million unrealized Jeffrey Huang crypto loss is a snapshot in time, reflecting market conditions at a specific moment. The future value of his positions, and indeed the broader crypto market, will depend on numerous evolving factors. However, it undeniably underscores the adventurous and sometimes precarious journey of navigating the digital asset landscape. In conclusion, Jeffrey Huang’s substantial unrealized losses serve as a compelling narrative within the crypto world. They remind us that even deep pockets and influential positions do not guarantee immunity from market forces. For every investor, the key takeaway is the paramount importance of informed decision-making, robust risk management, and a clear understanding of market dynamics to navigate the exhilarating yet unpredictable journey of cryptocurrency investment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Jeffrey Huang (Machi Big Brother) in the crypto world? A1: Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother, is a Taiwanese singer and a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency and NFT space. He is particularly known as a significant holder of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs and a crypto whale with substantial digital asset investments. Q2: What is an unrealized loss in cryptocurrency? A2: An unrealized loss occurs when the current market value of an asset you own drops below the price you paid for it, but you have not yet sold the asset. It’s a theoretical loss that only becomes ‘realized’ if you sell the asset at that lower price. Q3: Which assets are contributing to Jeffrey Huang’s unrealized losses? A3: Jeffrey Huang’s unrealized losses are primarily attributed to his long positions in Ethereum (ETH) and two other tokens, HYPE and PUMP. The latter two are likely smaller, more volatile altcoins or meme coins. Q4: How does market volatility impact crypto whales like Jeffrey Huang? A4: Market volatility can significantly impact crypto whales due to their large, often concentrated positions. While they can see massive gains during bull runs, sharp market corrections can lead to substantial unrealized losses, as seen with Jeffrey Huang crypto holdings, amplifying the financial impact of price swings. Q5: What lessons can investors learn from Jeffrey Huang’s situation? A5: Investors can learn the importance of understanding unrealized versus realized losses, implementing robust risk management strategies, being cautious of highly speculative assets (like ‘HYPE’ and ‘PUMP’ tokens), and regularly monitoring their portfolios to adapt to market changes.

2025-08-01 07:34:08,49348294,1754033648,XRP Could Print Highest Monthly Close Ever If This Happens,"In what appears to be a defining moment for XRP, the token is on the verge of closing July 2025 at its highest monthly level ever. Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a crypto commentator on X, drew attention to this development, noting that a monthly close at $3.0599 or above would break XRP’s record. At the time of his post, XRP had just over two hours left in the trading session, and traded at $3.0599, with the community anticipating a new record to add to XRP’s list of accolades in 2025. If XRP closes today at this level or higher, that’ll be the highest monthly close for XRP ever. 2.5 hours to go. pic.twitter.com/4yEaPKgppn — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) July 31, 2025 A Historic Year for XRP 2025 has been a remarkable year for XRP. The asset began the year by hitting a multi-year peak of $3.39, and sustained that momentum throughout January. After spending 16 consecutive days above $3, the asset experienced its highest monthly close , ending January at $3.0354. Although the asset experienced a decline in the following months, it began building back up and closed the second quarter of 2025 at around $2.4, marking its highest quarterly close in history . Following this feat, XRP experienced a massive surge in July, rising to a new all-time high of $3.65, outperforming many altcoins and surpassing expectations. Shortly after, the asset experienced its second-highest weekly close . Very few assets can boast of a similar list of accomplishments, and many experts believe XRP is just getting started. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Multi-Year Resistance Finally Breached According to the chart, XRP has now broken above a multi-year range that capped price action since early 2018. This recent move began earlier in 2025 and accelerated over the past month. Xoom’s visual analysis hints at a structural similarity to the 2017 breakout. This suggests that the current rally could be more than a short-term spike. The 36.79% gain this month alone reflects a sharp acceleration in momentum. While XRP has historically been known for volatile moves, sustained strength into its highest monthly close, especially after years of stagnation, is an extremely bullish sign. If this close holds, it effectively validates the breakout from a high timeframe perspective and could mark the start of a massive bull run targeting higher levels. Analysts and market participants will watch closely to see if this momentum persists into August. Any further continuation would need to contend with psychological levels above $3.5 and, eventually, the all-time high at $3.65 .

First Presale by P2P Foundation Holding Satoshi Nakamoto’s Only Online Account and Commons Foundation with Blockchain Core Technology The first presale of SatoshiMeme (SATOSHI), a meme coin project jointly developed by P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation, begins on August 1st at 18:00 (UTC+9). P2P Foundation is the only online platform where Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto was active, while Commons Foundation has been updating blockchain core technology and operating mainnet for 8 years. This project reinterprets Satoshi Nakamoto’s philosophy and economic perspective for the modern era. First Presale Begins August 1st, 18:00 (UTC+9) The presale consists of 8 phases, with token prices gradually increasing by the team at each stage. First presale participants can secure tokens at prices up to 50% lower than subsequent phase participants. Commons Foundation Chairman Choi Yong-kwan stated, “The first presale allocation is limited to 8 billion SATOSHI, and considering the pre-launch interest, we expect it to sell out quickly. We encourage interested investors to participate right at the launch time.” Simple Participation Process Participating in the SATOSHI presale is straightforward. After sending USDT to the wallet address provided on the official website , participants install the WONPAY app, a dedicated MicroBitcoin wallet, to generate a wallet address. Subsequently, by emailing the transaction details (TXID) along with the wallet address, tokens are automatically distributed. Support for Tron (TRC-20), Solana, and BSC networks allows participants to freely choose their preferred network. Cryptocurrency Community Attention SatoshiMeme has drawn online engagement ahead of its presale, with social media discussions referencing its thematic alignment with Satoshi Nakamoto’s philosophy and the joint involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation. The hashtag #SatoshiMeme has been used in related conversations on Twitter. According to SatoshiMeme’s team, the participation of P2P Foundation has led to perceptions that distinguish SatoshiMeme from other meme coin initiatives, with some community members referring to SatoshiMeme as a ‘true successor’ to Satoshi and attributing ‘historical legitimacy’ to SatoshiMeme. These characterizations remain unverified and reflect the team’s interpretation of community sentiment. Presale Allocation and Market Outlook The first presale allocation is limited to 8 billion SATOSHI out of the total token supply, moving to the next phase immediately upon completion. According to the commons economic model, individuals or organizations contributing to the SatoshiMeme project will receive rewards through airdrops. According to SatoshiMeme’s team, SatoshiMeme has drawn attention due to the involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation, both of which have established backgrounds in blockchain-related initiatives. The team anticipates strong interest during the initial presale phase, citing broader market trends in which projects with distinctive themes and active communities have seen rapid presale completions SatoshiMeme is a token based on the MicroBitcoin (MBC) network, pursuing the realization of the micro-economic currency function originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. The project team has begun discussions with various major exchanges for listing and is preparing for exchange listings after presale completion.

2025-08-01 07:30:00,49348152,1754033400,Top Cryptocurrency to Invest in as Ethereum (ETH) Rise Boosts Altcoin Market,"Ethereum’s bullish breakout has reignited the altcoin market, and investors are racing to reposition before the next wave hits. But while ETH’s momentum is lifting the tide, one name is turning heads for all the right reasons, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance costs $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. The price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 in the following phase. Buyers who invest now are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment when the project hits the launch price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance has sold over $13.8 million and has recorded over 14,700 investors. As capital flows back into high-potential plays, now’s the moment to get ahead of the curve. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum as Phase 6 Goes Live Mutuum Finance is making waves in presale, selling out the 5th phase before time. The project is already in phase 6 at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is reshaping the DeFi space by creating a scalable financial system with real-world uses. The presale has onboarded more than 14,700 token holders and raised more than $13.8 million. $100,000 Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has also organized a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be given $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is a testament to how the project is committed to building a long-term and dedicated community. CertiK-Powered Bug Bounty Boosts DeFi Security In further efforts towards providing its transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project team will reward a maximum of $50,000 USDT to those who identify likely vulnerabilities in the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to have a right coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is partitioned into the four severity classes; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the team’s commitment towards the security of ecosystem as well as investors’ trust. Next-Gen Dual-Lending Solutions Mutuum Finance is a top DeFi platform wherein the users are still in full control of their assets. The platform employs a double-lending process to provide flexibility as well as the effectiveness which entails Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract employs self-executing smart contracts that carry out the lending automatically with no human intervention. They are programmed to respond to changing market prices based on a floating rate of interest governed by the then-existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the intermediaries and stands a possibility of being directly linked with borrowers and lenders. It is more common in meme coins because it stands a possibility of having specific terms of a loan and adaptability based on the willingness of a user to take risk.

P2P Foundation is the only online platform where Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto was active, while Commons Foundation has been updating blockchain core technology and operating mainnet for 8 years. This project reinterprets Satoshi Nakamoto's philosophy and economic perspective for the modern era. First Presale Begins August 1st, 18:00 (UTC+9) The presale consists of 8 phases, with token prices gradually increasing by the team at each stage. First presale participants can secure tokens at prices up to 50% lower than subsequent phase participants. Commons Foundation Chairman Choi Yong-kwan stated, ""The first presale allocation is limited to 8 billion SATOSHI, and considering the pre-launch interest, we expect it to sell out quickly. We encourage interested investors to participate right at the launch time."" Simple Participation Process Participating in the $SATOSHI presale is straightforward. After sending USDT to the wallet address provided on the official website , participants install the WONPAY app, a dedicated MicroBitcoin wallet, to generate a wallet address. Subsequently, by emailing the transaction details (TXID) along with the wallet address, tokens are automatically distributed. Support for Tron (TRC-20), Solana, and BSC networks allows participants to freely choose their preferred network. Cryptocurrency Community Attention SatoshiMeme has drawn online engagement ahead of its presale, with social media discussions referencing its thematic alignment with Satoshi Nakamoto's philosophy and the joint involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation. The hashtag #SatoshiMeme has been used in related conversations on Twitter. According to SatoshiMeme's team, the participation of P2P Foundation has led to perceptions that distinguish SatoshiMeme from other meme coin initiatives, with some community members referring to SatoshiMeme as a 'true successor' to Satoshi and attributing 'historical legitimacy' to SatoshiMeme. These characterizations remain unverified and reflect the team's interpretation of community sentiment. Presale Allocation and Market Outlook The first presale allocation is limited to 8 billion SATOSHI out of the total token supply, moving to the next phase immediately upon completion. According to the commons economic model, individuals or organizations contributing to the SatoshiMeme project will receive rewards through airdrops. According to SatoshiMeme's team, SatoshiMeme has drawn attention due to the involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation, both of which have established backgrounds in blockchain-related initiatives. The team anticipates strong interest during the initial presale phase, citing broader market trends in which projects with distinctive themes and active communities have seen rapid presale completions SatoshiMeme is a token based on the MicroBitcoin (MBC) network, pursuing the realization of the micro-economic currency function originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. The project team has begun discussions with various major exchanges for listing and is preparing for exchange listings after presale completion.

2025-08-01 07:27:26,49348010,1754033246,$600M in Longs Wiped as BTC Crashes to 3-Week Low on Trump Tariff Shock,"Today, being August 1, means that many of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs against multiple nations are supposed to be enforced, which had a drastic impact on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, for one, dropped by several grand in a day to a multi-week low of under $114,500. Trump’s Latest Tariff Adjustments August 1 was a pivotal date for Trump’s global policy, as he had outlined it as a deadline for tariff implementation against numerous nations. On Thursday, the POTUS signed an executive order to change the stipulations. For one, he imposed a 10% tariff on goods imported from every country, aside from the 92 nations listed in an annex that are subject to higher rates. Trump also raised tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%. “I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners,” the POTUS said . Many economic experts rushed to offer their insights on what the actual impact would be on the financial markets, including crypto. The Kobeissi Letter, for instance, noted that the trade war has “lost all credibility.” The market says the trade war has lost all credibility: President Trump just seemingly just randomly decided to raise tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%. On top of this, he imposed “reciprocal tariffs” on Vietnam, Switzerland, South Africa, Taiwan, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia,… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 1, 2025 But Crypto Corrects Recall that the entire crypto market plunged hard in April following Trump’s original tariff call. At the time, BTC went from a six-digit territory to a five-month low of under $75,000 within days as the market wiped out nearly half a trillion dollars. The landscape, for now at least, is not as painful, but BTC and the altcoins are still in the red after Trump’s executive order. Bitcoin’s price had recovered to almost $119,000 yesterday after the Fed’s decision to maintain the interest rates, but dumped by more than four grand to a multi-week low of $114,400. Although it has recovered some ground since then, it’s still more than 3% down on the day. The altcoins have it even worse, with ETH and XRP dropping by 6%, while SPX, ENA, CRV, INJ, PENGU, JUP, BONK, SEI, and several others have nosedived by double digits. The total crypto market cap has seen over $150 billion gone since yesterday’s peak and is down to $3.820 trillion on CG. BTCUSD.

2025-08-01 07:27:21,49362758,1754033241,"Grayscale, VanEck, and Others Update Solana ETF Filings in Push for SEC Approval","Several asset managers have revised their filings for Solana exchange-traded funds, signaling forward movement toward potential approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This week, several leading financial firms, including Fidelity, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, CoinShares, Canary Capital, and VanEck, submitted revised proposals to the U.S. SEC as part of a renewed bid to introduce spot Solana ETFs.The updated S-1 registration statements reflect what market observers interpret as constructive engagement between issuers and the SEC. In a post on X, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth, noted that the amendments are relatively minor. However, he suggested they reflect a back-and-forth process aimed at refining prospectus language and meeting regulatory expectations.Grayscale Discloses Fee StructureFor context, Grayscale stated that it intends to charge a 2.5% management fee for its Solana fund, payable not in fiat, but directly in SOL tokens. This approach aligns with Grayscale’s broader crypto-native strategy and offers a potential differentiator in an increasingly crowded ETF landscape.Growing Pipeline of Crypto ETF ProposalsBeyond firm-level adjustments, the SEC is reviewing a growing number of crypto ETF applications. These include ETFs not only for Solana but also for assets such as XRP and Dogecoin. As more proposals advance to the review stage, industry analysts believe that approval of even a single fund could pave the way for broader acceptance of digital asset investment products.SEC Warms to Crypto Under New LeadershipThe growing number of ETF applications is unfolding alongside broader policy updates from the SEC. Earlier this week, the agency approved in-kind redemptions for both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. It also raised options limits for Bitcoin funds.Building on the regulatory momentum, SEC Chair Paul Atkins introduced a new initiative dubbed "" Project Crypto "" on Thursday. The initiative, aimed at overhauling the agency’s outdated digital asset framework, marks a significant policy shift. Most notably, Atkins stated that ""most crypto assets are not securities"", a reversal from previous SEC positions that could open the door to broader ETF approvals across the crypto market.This change in regulatory tone also reflects the Trump administration's more accommodating stance toward digital assets. Industry watchers believe such a climate could accelerate approvals for a wide range of crypto ETFs.Solana Price SnapshotAmid ETF-related developments, Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has shown mixed performance. As of press time, it was trading at $170.10, marking a 6% decrease over the past 24 hours and a 5% decrease over the past week. Despite short-term volatility, the token remains up 14.1% over the past month, trading within a broad range of $121 to $204.",Market|Latest Solana (SOL) News Today|Solana ETF,EN,1,several asset manager revised filing solana fund signaling forward movement toward potential approval security exchange commission week several leading financial firm including fidelity bitwise franklin templeton grayscale coinshares canary capital vaneck submitted revised proposal sec part renewed bid introduce spot solana updated registration statement reflect market observer interpret constructive engagement issuer sec post x nate geraci president novadius wealth noted amendment relatively minor however suggested reflect process aimed refining prospectus language meeting regulatory discloses fee structurefor context grayscale stated intends charge management fee solana fund payable fiat directly sol token approach aligns grayscale broader strategy offer potential differentiator increasingly crowded etf pipeline crypto etf proposalsbeyond adjustment sec reviewing growing number crypto etf application include etf solana also asset xrp dogecoin proposal advance review stage industry analyst believe approval even single fund could pave way broader acceptance digital asset investment warms crypto new leadershipthe growing number etf application unfolding alongside broader policy update sec earlier week agency approved redemption bitcoin ethereum spot etf also raised option limit bitcoin regulatory momentum sec chair paul atkins introduced new initiative dubbed project crypto thursday initiative aimed overhauling agency outdated digital asset framework mark significant policy shift notably atkins stated crypto asset security reversal previous sec position could open door broader etf approval across crypto change regulatory tone also reflects trump administration accommodating stance toward digital asset industry watcher believe climate could accelerate approval wide range crypto price snapshotamid development solana sol cryptocurrency market capitalization shown mixed performance press time trading marking decrease past hour decrease past week despite volatility token remains past month trading within broad range,0.0,0.809,0.191,0.9934,1

Cryptocurrency Community Attention SatoshiMeme has drawn online engagement ahead of its presale, with social media discussions referencing its thematic alignment with Satoshi Nakamoto's philosophy and the joint involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation. The hashtag #SatoshiMeme has been used in related conversations on Twitter. According to SatoshiMeme's team, the participation of P2P Foundation has led to perceptions that distinguish SatoshiMeme from other meme coin initiatives, with some community members referring to SatoshiMeme as a 'true successor' to Satoshi and attributing 'historical legitimacy' to SatoshiMeme. These characterizations remain unverified and reflect the team's interpretation of community sentiment. Presale Allocation and Market Outlook The first presale allocation is limited to 8 billion SATOSHI out of the total token supply, moving to the next phase immediately upon completion. According to the commons economic model, individuals or organizations contributing to the SatoshiMeme project will receive rewards through airdrops. According to SatoshiMeme's team, SatoshiMeme has drawn attention due to the involvement of P2P Foundation and Commons Foundation, both of which have established backgrounds in blockchain-related initiatives.

2025-08-01 07:25:36,49348694,1754033136,Analysts eye $5K for Ethereum and 42x for this ETH-based altcoin,"This innovative DeFi project is leveraging Layer-2 efficiency and a unique lending model. As the crypto market evolves, both assets are capturing investor interest. Let’s explore their momentum. Ethereum’s steady climb toward $5,000 Ethereum is defying Bitcoin’s recent dip, maintaining strength near $4,000. Robust ETF inflows totaling $5.51 billion since July 3 are fueling this rally. Institutional buying is growing, with corporate treasuries holding nearly 2% of Ethereum’s supply. Analysts are citing a favorable regulatory shift, with the SEC softening its stance on staking. This could unlock new ETF features, boosting demand. Macroeconomic tailwinds, like steady Federal Reserve rates and AI-driven market sentiment are further supporting Ethereum’s ascent. A short squeeze is possible, potentially pushing prices past $5,000 soon. Consequently, Ethereum’s fundamentals are aligning for a significant breakout. Transitioning to emerging altcoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving its niche. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through Phase 6 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.035.

Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, with only a limited supply remaining before a 14.3% price hike to $0.04 in Phase 7. Over $13,800,000 has been raised, with 660 million tokens sold to 14,700 holders. The project’s capped 4 billion token supply is driving demand. Furthermore, analysts are projecting a post-launch price of $1.50, suggesting a potential 42x return. This momentum is underpinned by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s robust utility.

2025-08-01 07:25:11,49347912,1754033111,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Plunge Below $115,000 Sparks Concerns","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Plunge Below $115,000 Sparks Concerns The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, often characterized by swift movements. Recently, a significant event has captured the attention of investors worldwide: a notable Bitcoin price drop . According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency, BTC, has dipped below the critical $115,000 mark, currently trading at approximately $114,970.31 on the Binance USDT market. This development prompts a closer look at the factors at play and what it could mean for the broader crypto ecosystem. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces driving a Bitcoin price drop requires examining various market indicators and macroeconomic factors. Cryptocurrency markets are highly sensitive, and several elements can contribute to sudden shifts in valuation. Here are some common contributors: Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, or interest rate hikes by central banks can lead investors to de-risk, moving away from volatile assets like Bitcoin. This often correlates with a broader flight to safety, impacting risk assets globally. Regulatory Developments: News or rumors of stricter cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can create investor apprehension, leading to sell-offs. Uncertainty around new laws or enforcement actions can trigger a swift reaction across the market, contributing to a significant Bitcoin price drop . Whale Movements: Large transactions by significant holders (often termed ‘whales’) can influence market supply and demand, potentially triggering a Bitcoin price drop if substantial amounts are sold. Monitoring on-chain data for large movements can sometimes provide early indicators. Market Sentiment and Technical Indicators: A shift in overall market sentiment, perhaps fueled by negative news or a breach of key technical support levels, can accelerate downward trends. When Bitcoin breaks through established support, it often signals further downside potential, prompting algorithmic trading and retail investor reactions. The $115,000 level may have been a crucial psychological and technical support that, once breached, led to further selling pressure. Liquidation Events: In highly leveraged markets, a downward price movement can trigger liquidations of long positions, creating a cascade effect that further pushes prices down. This phenomenon can exacerbate a natural Bitcoin price drop , leading to rapid declines. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? A substantial Bitcoin price drop can evoke a range of reactions from investors, depending on their investment horizon and risk tolerance. For some, it presents a challenge, while for others, it might be an opportunity. Let’s explore the implications: Short-Term Traders: For those engaged in short-term trading, a rapid decline like this can lead to significant losses if positions are not managed effectively. Stop-loss orders are crucial for mitigating risk in such volatile conditions, helping to protect capital during a sharp Bitcoin price drop . Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Many long-term investors view such dips as temporary fluctuations within Bitcoin’s broader growth trajectory. They might see it as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower price, adhering to the ‘buy the dip’ strategy, believing in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite the current Bitcoin price drop . Liquidation Risks: Investors using leverage on exchanges face the risk of their positions being liquidated if the price falls below their margin requirements. This can be a painful consequence of a sudden Bitcoin price drop , especially for those with high leverage. Market Sentiment: Persistent downward pressure can erode overall market confidence, potentially leading to a broader sell-off across altcoins as well, given Bitcoin’s dominant position. A significant Bitcoin price drop often signals a ‘risk-off’ environment for the entire crypto market. To illustrate the typical price movements and potential impact, consider the following simplified market scenario: Market Event Potential Investor Reaction Short-Term Impact Long-Term Outlook Significant Bitcoin Price Drop Panic selling, forced liquidations, ‘buy the dip’ strategies Increased volatility, potential for further declines Opportunity for accumulation, potential for recovery and growth Negative Macro News Risk-off sentiment, shift to safer assets Broader market correction, correlation with traditional markets Temporary setback, underlying fundamentals may remain strong Learn more about market analysis tools that can help you understand price movements. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies After a Bitcoin Price Drop While a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, it is also a reminder of the importance of sound investment principles. How can investors navigate these turbulent waters? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information from multiple reputable sources. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on social media hype or fear. Focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and adoption trends, especially during a period of Bitcoin price drop . Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy helps average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term volatility and making a Bitcoin price drop less impactful on your overall average. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, not just cryptocurrencies. For traders, utilize stop-loss orders to limit potential downside and protect against unexpected movements during a Bitcoin price drop . Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic news, regulatory updates, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Understanding the broader context can help in making informed decisions during a Bitcoin price drop . Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience and recovery after significant dips. While past performance is not indicative of future results, a long-term outlook can help weather short-term storms and focus on Bitcoin’s potential growth despite a temporary Bitcoin price drop . Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any asset class, including cryptocurrencies. The key is to react thoughtfully rather than emotionally. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While such movements can be alarming, they are also integral to the market’s cycles. Understanding the underlying causes, assessing the impact on various investor profiles, and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount. For many, this dip might represent a strategic accumulation opportunity, reinforcing the importance of a long-term vision in the dynamic world of digital assets. Staying informed, exercising patience, and adhering to a well-thought-out investment plan are the best ways to navigate these challenging yet potentially rewarding periods. Frequently Asked Questions Q1: What does a Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 signify? A: It signifies a significant downward price movement, potentially driven by market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, or large sell-offs. For many, it indicates a breach of a psychological or technical support level, prompting further scrutiny of market conditions and highlighting the current Bitcoin price drop . Q2: Is this Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? A: For long-term investors, a significant Bitcoin price drop can be seen as an opportunity to buy at a lower price, often referred to as ‘buying the dip’. However, this depends on individual risk tolerance and investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? A: The duration of a Bitcoin price drop can vary widely, from a few days to several months, depending on the underlying causes and broader market conditions. There is no fixed timeline, and historical performance does not guarantee future results. Q4: What should I do if my crypto portfolio is down due to this Bitcoin price drop? A: It is important to avoid panic selling. Revisit your original investment thesis, assess your risk exposure, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging. If you are over-leveraged, managing your positions promptly is critical. Staying informed and consulting with a financial advisor, if needed, can also be beneficial during a Bitcoin price drop . Q5: Are there specific indicators to watch during a Bitcoin price drop? A: Yes, key indicators include trading volume (to gauge selling pressure), funding rates (for derivatives markets), on-chain metrics (like exchange inflows/outflows), and macroeconomic news (e.g., inflation data, interest rate announcements). Monitoring these can provide insights into market dynamics during a Bitcoin price drop . Did this article help you understand the recent Bitcoin price drop and its implications?

2025-08-01 07:21:19,49348693,1754032879,Investors pile into $0.035 coin as BNB and DOGE stall,"BNB and DOGE hold flat Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have been trading sideways, with BNB at ~$832 and DOGE at ~$0.24, showing minimal movement despite recent market volatility. BNB’s consolidation follows a 1.6 million token burn and Maxwell upgrade, which boosted active wallets by 37%, yet trading volume dipped 10% to $2.9 billion, reflecting investor caution. Technical indicators, including a neutral RSI (~50) and weakening ADX, suggest BNB lacks a clear catalyst to break resistance at $900. DOGE, down 10.75% weekly, struggles below $0.26 resistance, despite a 5.98% surge in open interest to $4.38 billion, signaling futures market confidence. Profit-taking after a 40% rally and a declining MFI indicates fading momentum. Both coins face macroeconomic headwinds and altcoin market fragmentation, with potential ETF approvals for DOGE and TRON’s market cap overtake of ADA diverting attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): from idle holdings to active yield BNB and DOGE holders have watched their portfolios stay flat, but early adopters of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have already seen sharp upward movement. Since the launch, the token has surged 350% from its Phase 1 price of $0.01. An investor who exited DOGE in Phase 3 and entered at $0.02 is now sitting on a 75% gain, and that gain isn’t speculative. It’s backed by real usage metrics like protocol growth in lending, borrowing, and upcoming platform functionalities. One core innovation driving activity is Mutuum Finance’s decentralized stablecoin system. Unlike models that collapsed due to poor backing or unlimited minting, this stablecoin will be minted only when overcollateralized loans are issued. It will be burned once the loan is repaid. The issuance is strictly controlled by protocol-level interest rate adjustments and blue-chip asset collateral. This ensures that the stablecoin maintains a strong peg while keeping the supply limited and accountable. As borrowing and staking activity grow, so does stablecoin demand, and that directly translates to increased utility and velocity for the MUTM token. Upcoming demand is also set to increase with the launch of the beta version of the lending and borrowing platform. This rollout will onboard new users, introduce liquidity to various pools, and drive platform volume—all activities that will place upward price pressure on MUTM as usage expands. More users interacting with the protocol equals more mtTokens minted, more fees generated, and more incentives distributed, further increasing the need for MUTM. Lending, staking, and buybacks: a self-reinforcing system Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just offering a new stablecoin—it’s building an ecosystem designed to reward every participant. Lenders who deposit assets like ETH, USDT, or SOL receive mtTokens, which automatically grow in value as interest accrues over time. These tokens can also be staked in smart contracts to earn passive MUTM rewards, which are distributed from protocol profits via automatic buybacks. This creates a dual-reward mechanism: your principal grows via APY, and your yield is further enhanced through MUTM dividends. As this ecosystem scales, token demand increases while circulating supply drops through consistent buybacks. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) model, lenders earn based on how much of the pool is utilized. For instance, lending 1,000 USDT when pool utilization is 80% can earn an APY of around 12%. Borrowers can lock up blue-chip assets and borrow against them, say 2 ETH ($7,000) at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, allowing them to access $4,200 without selling their ETH. That kind of access will pull more borrowers onto the platform, and every new loan increases protocol utility, and in turn, demand for MUTM. The platform will also support a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending system for users looking to negotiate custom terms with higher-risk assets like memecoins. While more advanced, it opens up alternative channels for interest generation, expanding Mutuum’s appeal to more DeFi users. Presale acceleration and rotation-driven momentum With over 14,700 holders already participating and more than $13.7 million raised, Phase 6 is now live at a token price of $0.035. Only 7% of the 170 million tokens allocated to Phase 6 have been sold. Once this phase concludes, the price will rise to $0.040, marking an immediate 15% increase. With a capped total supply of 4 billion MUTM, entry at this stage offers a clear upside for those seeking strong pre-launch positioning. CertiK has already completed its audit of the project, with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Security Score of 78.00. A $50,000 bug bounty is currently running to maintain the protocol’s integrity. Meanwhile, the ongoing $100,000 giveaway —divided among ten winners—adds further excitement and reach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted 12,000+ Twitter followers, building a strong community foundation ahead of launch. For investors still holding stagnant coins like BNB or DOGE, this is a compelling moment to rotate into a project that’s not only growing but doing so with actual mechanics and capital efficiency. Between the protocol’s in-process dual-yield systems, stablecoin design, Layer-2 scalability, and the beta rollout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer not just another presale opportunity, but a working product ecosystem that’s driving token value with every new feature introduced. Now trading under $0.04, this token looks primed to keep climbing, without needing a meme or hype cycle to move.

2025-08-01 07:20:45,49348692,1754032845,Mutuum Finance aiming for $5: could it be the best play before Q1 2026?,"From interest-earning lending to overcollateralized borrowing, from a protocol-native stablecoin to automated buybacks and staking, every part of the ecosystem is being designed to generate constant demand for the MUTM token, not just now, but as each function rolls out in its roadmap. Real DeFi functionality, built for longevity The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending engine is being built to offer passive daily returns for lenders based on pool utilization. When demand for loans is high, lenders benefit from higher annual percentage yields (APY). This creates a natural incentive to deposit assets like USDT, DAI, or even wrapped ETH and BTC — all while remaining in control of funds thanks to non-custodial smart contracts. Borrowers, meanwhile, access capital through overcollateralized vaults, offering a safer borrowing model. By requiring borrowers to lock more value than they borrow, the platform ensures protocol-wide solvency and reduces systemic risk. Users don’t need to sell their blue-chip crypto assets — they can borrow stablecoins while maintaining upside exposure. Perhaps the most exciting mechanism is the upcoming protocol-native stablecoin, which only mints when a loan is issued and burns upon repayment. This means its supply is directly tied to platform activity. As lending and borrowing increase, stablecoin transactions rise, driving more demand across the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) system. Another unique driver of token demand will be the staking system and buyback engine. As protocol revenue grows, a portion of earnings will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the market and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This creates a direct buy-pressure loop that rewards MUTM holders while controlling available supply — the textbook setup for exponential price movements. To scale these services further, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deploy its protocol on a Layer-2 network, enabling faster transactions and significantly lower gas fees. This infrastructure shift is expected to bring in a new wave of cost-conscious users and make lending, borrowing, and staking more efficient and accessible to retail and institutional users alike. Why early buyers are targeting the $5 mark At the time of writing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, with more than $13.7 million already raised and over 14,700 holders onboarded. The next phase will see the token jump by 15%, reaching $0.040 — a steep climb toward its planned listing price of $0.06, which represents a 70% potential increase from current levels. However, many early-phase investors entered back in Phase 1 when MUTM was priced at just $0.01. That means even at this stage, they are already sitting on 3.5x gains — and with analysts eyeing the $5 level by 2026, that would mean a staggering 500x return from the earliest entries, and nearly 140x even from today’s price. Security remains a top priority, too. The codebase has undergone an extensive manual review and static analysis through a $50,000 bug bounty program in partnership with CertiK. Audit scores currently stand at Token Scan 95.00 and Skynet 78.00, offering confidence to investors concerned about smart contract risks. To further grow its community and fuel adoption, the team has launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign, where ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM. This initiative, combined with an active and growing social media base of over 12,000 Twitter followers, sets the stage for a viral launch, especially as the beta version of the protocol goes live just ahead of token release. As each layer of the platform activates — from stablecoin mechanics to staking and buybacks — the demand for MUTM is expected to accelerate rapidly. This isn’t just a project that will rely on hype; it’s one where value is generated with every transaction, every loan, and every stake. Final thoughts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t mimicking legacy DeFi — it’s rewriting the playbook with smarter tokenomics, active buyback mechanisms, and real financial services wrapped into a scalable architecture. With only 7% of Phase 6 tokens sold and a listing price around the corner, the window to enter at this stage is rapidly closing. As new features unlock and user adoption rises, each part of the ecosystem will fuel the next — a compounding effect that can push MUTM well beyond its presale valuations. With a clear roadmap and tight supply dynamics, the goal of $5 by early 2026 isn’t a moonshot — it’s a strategic trajectory built on fundamentals.

The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 32 real-time technical indicators, BlackRock partnership speculation, SEC appeal developments, and institutional adoption metrics to assess XRP’s 90-day trajectory amid key technical inflection between continued consolidation and explosive breakout momentum. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $3.09 reflects a minimal -0.16% daily decline from an opening price of $3.10 , establishing a tight trading range between $3.18 (high) and $3.08 (low). This 3.3% intraday range demonstrates controlled consolidation typical of preparation phases before major directional moves. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 The RSI at 56.09 sits in healthy neutral territory, indicating balanced momentum with substantial room for upward movement without reaching overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal an exceptional bullish structure with XRP trading above all major EMAs: 20-day at $3.07 ( +0.7% ), 50-day at $2.77 ( +10.3% ), 100-day at $2.56 ( +17.2% ), and 200-day at $2.32 ( +25.0% ). This EMA configuration represents one of the strongest bullish technical setups in XRP’s recent history. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 The MACD indicators show key positioning at the zero line ( 0.0000 ) with a positive histogram at 0.2075, suggesting momentum building despite a neutral MACD reading. According to ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis, volume analysis shows substantial expansion to 73.86 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during consolidation. ATR readings at 2.29 suggest a high volatility environment with potential for major moves once the current consolidation phase resolves with institutional catalysts. Historical Context: Explosive Recovery from May Lows XRP’s 2025 performance demonstrates strong institutional confidence through regulatory uncertainty, with an explosive 122% recovery from April’s $1.60 low to the current consolidation above $3.00 . January-March consolidation between $3.10-$2.70 preceded April’s correction to $2.19 as regulatory uncertainty peaked. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 The decisive May bottom at $1.80 marked the institutional accumulation phase, followed by the explosive June recovery and July’s continued momentum toward current elevated levels. Current pricing maintains a 19.47% discount to the all-time high while securing extraordinary gains of over 110,000% from 2014 lows. Support & Resistance: Multiple Strong Support Levels Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $3.08 , reinforced by the key 20-day EMA at $3.07 . Key support zones demonstrate remarkable strength with 50-day EMA at $2.77 ( +10.3% buffer), 100-day EMA at $2.56 ( +17.2% buffer), and 200-day EMA at $2.32 ( +25% buffer). Resistance begins immediately at today’s high around $3.18 , followed by the key psychological resistance at $3.20-$3.25 . $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Major resistance emerges at $3.30-$3.40, where the completion of the double-bottom pattern could trigger explosive momentum toward $3.60+ targets. The technical setup suggests any pullback would find substantial support, while a breakout above $3.18 could trigger rapid appreciation toward $3.30-$3.60 based on pattern recognition and volume expansion potential. Institutional Breakthrough: BlackRock Partnership Speculation BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, Maxwell Stein, has confirmed participation in Ripple Swell 2025 . $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 The timing coincides with Ripple’s pursuit of U.S. Trust Bank status, which would allow XRP integration into Fed infrastructure for institutional payments. BlackRock’s engagement validates XRP’s institutional readiness and payment rails capabilities for traditional finance integration. The institutional validation extends beyond speculation, with Ripple’s legal status reaffirmed after the SEC motion rejection . Market Fundamentals: Stable Volume Amid Consolidation XRP maintains its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $184.13 billion , demonstrating institutional validation and sustained confidence. Volume metrics show remarkable stability with 24-hour trading volume at $5.98 billion , representing a healthy 3.19% volume-to-market cap ratio. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Circulating supply of 59.24 billion XRP represents 59.2% of the maximum 100 billion token supply, with Ripple’s controlled release schedule supporting price stability. The $310.8 billion fully diluted valuation reflects long-term growth expectations based on payment infrastructure adoption and institutional integration. Social Sentiment: Strong Community Despite Consolidation LunarCrush data reveals moderate social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 671 , indicating consolidation in speculative interest while maintaining fundamental strength. Galaxy Score of 37 reflects building momentum around institutional developments and partnership speculation. Engagement metrics show solid activity with 10.79 million total engagements, 58.32K mentions, and 8.87K creators contributing to discussions. Social dominance of 3.65% demonstrates XRP’s ability to maintain attention during consolidation phases. Sentiment registers at a robust 80% positive, reflecting community optimism around BlackRock partnership potential, SEC resolution, and institutional adoption acceleration. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Recent social themes focus on $1,000 price predictions, BlackRock collaboration, and payment infrastructure dominance. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast Scenarios BlackRock Partnership Breakout (45% Probability) Confirmed BlackRock strategic partnership combined with SEC appeal resolution could drive explosive appreciation toward $4.50-$6.00 , representing a 50-95% upside from current levels. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 This scenario requires sustained volume above 80 million daily and a successful break above $3.30 resistance. Technical targets include $3.60 , $4.80 , and $6.00 based on historical resistance levels and institutional flow projections. Extended High-Level Consolidation (35% Probability) Delayed partnership announcements could result in extended consolidation between $2.80-$3.40 , allowing technical indicators to reset while institutional positioning continues. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Support at multiple EMA levels would likely hold during consolidation, with volume maintaining around 60-70 million daily. This sideways action could extend 6-10 weeks pending major institutional announcements. Correction on Partnership Delays (20% Probability) Major delays in BlackRock partnership or Trust Bank approval could trigger selling toward $2.60-$2.80 support levels, representing 15-20% downside from current levels. This scenario would require unexpected institutional setbacks or broader crypto market weakness. $XRP could be forming a double bottom pattern! A close above $3.30 may confirm the breakout and open the door to $3.60. pic.twitter.com/4MXEmulUHF — Ali (@ali_charts) July 31, 2025 Recovery would depend on institutional buying at EMA support levels and eventual resolution of partnership speculation through confirmed collaboration announcements. XRP Price Forecast: Institutional Validation Meets Technical Strength ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis notes that XRP’s current positioning reflects unprecedented convergence of institutional validation, technical strength, and regulatory clarity. The combination of neutral RSI, key zero-line MACD with positive momentum building, and exceptional EMA support structure creates optimal risk-reward dynamics. Next Price Target: $5.00-$7.00 Within 90 Days For the next price action, XRP needs to stage a breakout above $3.18 resistance. From there, BlackRock partnership acceleration could propel XRP toward the $5.00 psychological milestone, with sustained institutional collaboration driving toward $7.00+ , representing new cycle highs. However, failure to break $3.18 resistance would indicate extended consolidation to the $2.80-$3.20 range. Institutional accumulation and increased demand can further drive XRP toward $10+ targets.

2025-07-31 21:13:21,49321890,1753996401,Google loses appeal in Epic Games lawsuit,"Google tried and failed on Thursday to persuade a U.S. appeals panel to rescind a jury verdict and federal court order in the Epic Games lawsuit that requires it to revamp its app store, Play. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a unanimous ruling, rejected Google’s claims that the trial judge made legal errors in the antitrust case from 2020 that unfairly benefited Epic Games . Google says the decision will harm user safety significantly Thursday’s ruling means Google Play Store will have to remove restrictions put in place to prevent app developers from setting up rival marketplaces and billing systems. The injunction should have taken effect earlier, but it has been on hold since last year after Google’s appeal. “It is well established that antitrust remedies can and often must proscribe otherwise lawful conduct to unwind and further prevent violators’ anticompetitive activity,” Judge Margaret McKeown wrote in a statement for the unanimous panel. McKeown also pointed out that the district court has the right to require Google to deal with parties harmed by its anticompetitive conduct, even its competitors. Google believes the decision has the potential to not only “significantly harm user safety” but also to undermine innovation for the Android operating system. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s Vice President for Regulatory Affairs, spoke about the subject: “Our top priority remains protecting our users and developers, and ensuring a secure platform as we continue our appeal.” Meanwhile, Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney has praised the ruling via a post shared on X, saying it would allow the company to offer its Epic Game Store via Google Play. This revamp is sure to affect Google, but by how much that will be is hard to say because Alphabet doesn’t process app store revenue separately in earnings. Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note last year that heightened use of third-party billing systems by media and gaming companies poses a larger threat to Google than rival app stores. “In a worst case scenario this could be a 20-30% drag on gross app store sales of around $50 billion, mostly subscriptions, which could be a $1-$1.5 billion drag on the company’s gross profit, based on our estimates,” Singh said. Epic concluded its case against Samsung weeks ago Epic Games’ case against Google is now taking center stage weeks after the company settled its antitrust claims against Samsung earlier this month. The lawsuit, which also involved Google, claimed that it conspired with the search engine giant to shield its app store, Google Play, from competition by using Samsung’s Auto Blocker feature, which allegedly discouraged users from downloading apps outside of Google Play and Samsung’s Galaxy store. Both Samsung and Google have denied any wrongdoing, and they have refused to disclose specific terms of the settlement. However, Epic Games is clearly satisfied with the outcome of the ruling, as the company’s chief executive Tim Sweeney expressed gratitude, claiming that Samsung will address its concerns in a post shared on X. As for its ongoing lawsuit with Google, it is a little early to break out the champagne because Google’s possible Supreme Court appeal could delay or alter the final outcome. Depending on how it turns out, the ruling could potentially reshape the Android app market by reducing barriers for developers and increasing consumer choice.

2025-07-31 21:11:00,49321672,1753996260,"Ethereum Price Prediction: “Symmetrical Triangle” Breakout Forms – ETH About to Explode Toward $16,000","Ethereum (ETH) has gone up by 5% in the past 7 days and it is currently the best-performing token of the top 5 during this period as it nears the $4,000 area. This favors a bullish Ethereum price prediction as momentum has accelerated for the top altcoin. ETH has managed to outperform Solana (SOL) on a year-to-date basis even though, at some point, it lagged its competitor with much higher yearly losses of around 50%. Now the top altcoin has booked year-to-date gains of 15.1%, primarily aided by the positive impact of the Pectra upgrade in the network’s operational framework. ETHEREUM BREAKING OUT ON THE MONTHLY!!!!!!!!!!!! TARGET $7,700 YES OOOH YES GUYS pic.twitter.com/z0sZvKxOYW — Ivan on Tech (@IvanOnTech) July 20, 2025 The popular crypto trader Ivan on Tech, whose X account is followed by nearly 500,000 users, shared an interesting bullish Ethereum price prediction that sees the token rising to $7,700 after a bullish breakout of a symmetrical triangle. This kind of technical setup occurs when the price consolidates and compresses until it trades in a very tight range. Symmetrical triangles are unbiased, meaning that they are not bullish or bearish until a breakout occurs. If the price breaks out to the upside as it has this time for Ethereum, this typically anticipates an explosive move. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch as ETH Nears $4,000 The weekly chart for ETH shows that the token has entered a key area of resistance as it nears the $4,000 level. However, it has not touched this psychological threshold. The market seems to be approaching this area cautiously as the last three times it has hit this mark the price has responded with a strong retreat. We could probably see ETH retesting $4K within the next few days (if not today). If the token does experience a setback the key support to watch in this higher time frame would be the $2,700 area. Even though this would mean a sizable correction, it could be the necessary pullback for a much stronger move toward higher targets like $5,000 and even $7,700 as Ivan On Tech predicts – although that sounds a bit extreme, all things considered. A move to $16,000 is unlikely right now unless a major breakthrough occurs that propels Ethereum to a new stage of growth. However, the token’s outlook is bullish as both technical indicators and the macroeconomic landscape favor a bullish Ethereum price prediction. As the crypto market continues to enjoy a wave of positive momentum, the most promising crypto presales like SUBBD (SUBBD) could deliver the highest upside potential as investors look for the next crypto to 10X. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $1M to Launch Its Decentralized Content Platform SUBBD (SUBBD) creates a better environment for influencers where they can share their content freely without fearing unfair restrictions and bans. The project supports the monetization of AI-generated content and offers lower platform fees to creators so they can keep a higher share of their earnings.

2025-07-31 21:07:53,49321504,1753996073,Strategy reports $14.03B in Q2 operating income and $10.02B in net income,"Strategy posted its biggest quarterly earnings ever in Q2 2025, and the reason is crystal clear: it’s sitting on a mountain of Bitcoin. The company, which now identifies as a Bitcoin treasury firm, reported $14.03 billion in operating income, a record-setting figure driven by crypto gains. This number shows a 7,106.4% increase from the same quarter last year, when the firm posted a $200 million operating loss. Strategy’s stock MSTR has surged by 2% after hours. According to Strategy’s official statement , this turnaround is directly tied to the company’s decision to value its crypto assets at fair market price under new accounting rules. The company also logged $10.02 billion in net income, up from a $102.6 million net loss the year prior. Diluted earnings per share reached $32.60, blowing past all historical performance. Strategy’s total Bitcoin holding stood at 628,791 BTC, bought at a cost of $46.07 billion. The average cost per coin sits around $73,277, and the company’s BTC is now worth far more than that based on current market prices. Bitcoin lifts income and updated yearly targets Phong Le, Strategy’s President and CEO, confirmed the numbers are a direct result of the firm’s aggressive crypto accumulation. “We expanded our bitcoin holdings to 628,791 bitcoins, raised over $10 billion through our ATM programs and IPOs, and saw growing institutional and retail demand for our securities,” Phong said. He added that Strategy’s Bitcoin per Share (BPS) climbed 25% year-to-date, prompting the firm to revise its BTC Yield target from 25% to 30%, and its BTC $ Gain projection from $15 billion to $20 billion by year’s end. He explained that fair value gains from Bitcoin pushed Q2 operating income to $14 billion and that the firm expects $34 billion in operating income and $24 billion in net income for the full year. The company is also forecasting $80 in EPS, predicting that Bitcoin reaches $150,000 by December. The crypto gain for Q2 alone stood at $9.5 billion, with the company holding 597,325 bitcoin as of June 30. These were valued at $64.4 billion, with a cost basis of $42.4 billion. An additional 31,466 BTC was acquired between July 1 and July 29. Strategy said it booked a $14 billion fair value gain in Q2, compared to a $180 million impairment loss using the old cost-based accounting system last year. Capital programs boost liquidity for Bitcoin buys Strategy brought in over $10.5 billion in fresh cash in Q2 and July through stock sales, with nearly half of it raised via its common stock ATM program. The company sold 14.2 million shares between April and June, raising $5.2 billion, and another 2.4 million shares in July for $1.1 billion. As of July 29, there’s still $17 billion worth of shares that can be sold under this program. The firm also leaned heavily on four preferred stock instruments: STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC. It raised $446.9 million from selling STRK shares in Q2 and another $71.8 million in July. For STRF, the numbers were $163.1 million in Q2 and $55.8 million in July. The IPO of STRD in May pulled in $979.7 million, and another $17.9 million came in through the STRD ATM in July. In total, the STRD ATM still has $4.2 billion left unissued. Then in July, the company launched STRC and raised $2.5 billion through its IPO. Outside of crypto, Strategy’s software business reported $114.5 million in total revenue for Q2, a 2.7% increase from last year. The biggest growth came from subscription services, which climbed 69.5% year-over-year to $40.8 million. Gross profit for the quarter was $78.7 million, giving the segment a 68.8% gross margin, slightly below last year’s 72.2%. Strategy closed Q2 with $50.1 million in cash, up from $38.1 million at the end of 2024. For the rest of 2025, Strategy said it expects to hit its revised Bitcoin goals through a mix of preferred stock offerings and common stock issuance, guided by mNAV thresholds. The company said this approach would grow its bitcoin wallet without exposing shareholders to unnecessary dilution. Strategy also noted that because of its large crypto holdings and the use of fair value accounting, its earnings are highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s market price. The firm closed by stating it will not update its guidance unless required by law. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-31 21:02:40,49321229,1753995760,"Apple reports $94.04 billion in Q2 revenue, its biggest quarterly jump since 2021","Apple just reported the biggest jump in its quarterly revenue in nearly four years, beating every forecast Wall Street had for its third fiscal quarter. According to the earnings report , the company posted $94.04 billion in revenue for the three-month period ending June 28, up 10% from the same quarter last year. The numbers weren’t close. Analysts had expected $89.53 billion, but Apple delivered nearly $4.5 billion more than that. The company also booked $1.57 in earnings per share, well above the $1.43 analysts expected, bringing in $24.43 billion in profit, compared to $21.45 billion a year ago. CEO Tim Cook said the company’s performance was boosted partly by people rushing to buy Apple products ahead of possible tariff hikes. “About 1% of the 10-point revenue growth was from customers looking to stay ahead of tariffs,” Tim told CNBC’s Steve Kovach. iPhone drives revenue while Mac leads in growth The iPhone once again led the charge, pulling in $44.58 billion in revenue, which is 13% more than the same quarter last year and beat the $40.22 billion estimate by a wide margin. Tim said sales were stronger this time around because the iPhone 16 was outperforming the iPhone 15, which had been on sale during the same period last year. He added that the iPhone 16 saw “strong double-digit” sales growth over its predecessor, especially from current users upgrading. While the iPhone brought in the most revenue, the Mac lineup grew faster than any other unit. Apple’s Mac business grew nearly 15% year-over-year, reaching $8.05 billion, topping the $7.26 billion forecast. That spike came after Apple launched new MacBook Air laptops—its top-selling Mac—right before the quarter began. Apple’s services division, which includes iCloud, the App Store, AppleCare, and licensing deals like the one with Google, also grew. Services brought in $27.42 billion, a 13% increase over the previous year, beating the $26.80 billion expectation. Tim said iCloud subscriptions saw “meaningful” growth, and App Store revenue climbed in double digits. iPad and wearables report weak numbers It wasn’t all up. The iPad business fell 8%, pulling in $6.58 billion, missing the $7.24 billion estimate. Apple had released a budget iPad in March, but it didn’t boost the numbers enough. Also down was the “Other Products” unit, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, and other accessories. That segment dropped 8.64% to $7.4 billion, under the $7.82 billion forecast. Still, Tim emphasized that even with those two weak spots, the overall numbers came in strong because of demand across the iPhone, Mac, and Services units. The company’s gross margin came in at 46.5%, beating the 45.9% estimate. Tim also repeated that part of the boost came from customers trying to get ahead of tariff-related price increases. Apple had previously estimated $900 million in extra costs tied to the Trump administration’s tariffs in the quarter. Tim didn’t give a new number but made it clear that the tariffs had already started affecting buyer behavior. China sees a rebound as Apple increases its AI push Apple also reported that revenue in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, grew 4% to $15.37 billion. That growth came after two straight quarters of decline—down 2% in Q2 and down 11% in Q1. Tim said local government subsidies helped boost sales in the region. “The subsidy does apply to some of our products, and it clearly helps,” he said on the earnings call. On the tech front, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June showcased new software for its hardware lines, but the company’s AI announcements left investors unimpressed. Still, Tim said Apple was putting heavy resources into artificial intelligence. “We are significantly growing our investments,” he said, calling AI “one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime.” Tim also said Apple had acquired around seven companies in 2025 to support its AI strategy, though none were major deals. “We’re open to M&A that accelerates our roadmap,” he said.

2025-07-31 21:00:59,49321981,1753995659,"Crypto Betting In 2025: How Spartans, Bet365, And Stake.Com Are Shaping The Future With Speed","The trend in 2025 shows crypto betting becoming mainstream. Bet365, Stake.com, and Spartans each offer a unique view on how crypto will fit into online gambling. While Bet365 uses coin options very cautiously, Stake.com pushes community-driven play, and Spartans focuses on fast payouts and smooth design. This article looks at their differences, explains how regulation affecting Stake.com has shaped the market, and shows why structure now defines success in crypto betting. Spartans: Functionality First, Flash Second Spartans take a design‑first path in crypto betting for 2025. Unlike Bet365’s cautious hybrid model or Stake.com’s socially charged platform, Spartans prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and speed. Its core strength: 100% real‑time play. Bettors use native coins directly, no conversions, no hidden steps. Every game action is recorded on the ‑chain. All rewards, referrals, and instant withdrawals happen without delay. Spartans stand out with its coin logic. Coins are not just a gimmick or marketing tool. They serve as a utility layer. Cashback, affiliate rewards, and gameplay incentives are built into coin logic from the start. That transparency appeals to users and also addresses many regulatory questions about Stake.com regulation and crypto betting compliance. Spartans may lack the celebrity sponsorships of its rivals, but it wins on fundamentals. By building around fast, fair, transparent mechanics, it avoids many regulatory pitfalls faced by other platforms. Its structured reward system and frictionless user flow hint at a future where clean execution surpasses bold marketing. Its architecture is audit‑friendly and regulation‑ready. With instant withdrawals and builtin coin utility, Spartans anticipates scrutiny and response needs. This design reduces friction if regulators focus on user protection, source of funds, or responsible gaming. Spartans’ clarity and execution strength give it resilience that platforms like Stake.com, under heavy regulatory view in 2025, struggle to match. By focusing on speed, transparency, and compliance built into core mechanics, Spartans chart a third path. It shows that careful planning and clear coin structure matter more than hype when regulation becomes central. Bet365: Controlled Integration With Traditional Leverage Bet365’s crypto strategy is strategic and measured for 2025. It adds digital assets as a complement to existing fiat systems. This lets Bet365 retain its traditional user base while testing blockchain betting. Crypto is treated as a feature, not a revolution. That appeals to users who want privacy and flexibility via coins. Yet this hybrid model has limits. Bet365 offers no utility coin layer, no staking rewards, and no native wallet gaming. Its chief focus is regulatory alignment. As Bet365 has long followed global compliance frameworks, it moves slowly in regions with unclear crypto betting laws. That shields the brand but slows innovation. Users wanting fast, fully coin-integrated gameplay may find Bet365 incomplete under today’s expectations. Stake.com: Community Engagement Meets Regulation Pressure Stake.com is famous among crypto gamblers for its strong community focus, social features, and aggressive sponsorship in 2025. It built a user base early by offering wallet-based betting, instant deposits and withdrawals, and a wide game library. Its success, however, drew regulatory attention in many jurisdictions. Stake.com regulation became intense in 2024 and 2025. Regulators questioned its KYC protocols, marketing tactics, and compliance with local gambling laws. In response, Stake.com tightened onboarding, added identity checks, and started applying for licenses. But stricter controls may weaken the appeal for those who came for low friction and anonymity. Still, Stake.com leads in social engagement. Its chat features, VIP programs, and global reach give it strong user retention. But with growing regulatory scrutiny and without a clean coin omics model, its next decisions are critical. Reputation increasingly depends on transparency, governance, and how it addresses compliance going forward. Stake.com Regulation: 2025’s Defining Theme The key issue in 2025 is accountability. Nowhere is that clearer than in Stake.com regulation discussions. Stake.com’s fast growth has drawn lawmakers’ attention. Regulators demand crypto platforms meet the same consumer protection standards as fiat operators. They look at sources of funds, responsible gaming, and oversight. In this context, Bet365’s slower but steady crypto entry feels safer, though less scalable. Stake.com’s rapid rise now calls for structural recalibration. Spartans benefit by learning from those challenges. Its clean coin design and audit-ready operations make it more resilient amid regulatory concerns. As regulation becomes central in 2025, platforms built for clarity and compliance will earn long-term trust and stability. Final Words Crypto betting is not one shape, it’s evolving several ways in 2025. Bet365 shows traditional caution with optional coin use. Stake.com shows growth through rapid crypto adoption but now faces regulation tradeoffs. Spartans offer a third path: structuring its coin utility, speed, and transparency from the ground up. As debates over Stake.com regulation grow, the edge goes to platforms that prioritize strong execution, clear coin logic, and smooth compliance. In the long run, the platform built to endure scrutiny and scale will succeed, not necessarily the flashiest brand.

2025-07-31 21:00:07,49321105,1753995607,"Bitcoin Sees Rising New Investor Dominance, Old Holders Yet To Capitulate","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate slightly below the $120,000 level, the dominance of new investors is steadily rising. However, on-chain data shows that BTC is still far from overheating, suggesting the premier cryptocurrency may have more room to run before a significant correction sets in. Bitcoin May Still Have Some Room To Run According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, new investor dominance in Bitcoin is gradually increasing – currently hovering around 30%, which is only halfway to the historical “overheated” threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Overheating Signals Easing – Is A Second-Half Rally Ahead? The analyst shared the following chart, which highlights two past instances – marked in orange – when new investor dominance reached overheated levels and coincided with BTC local price tops. The first instance occurred in March 2024 when the metric hit 64%, and the second in December 2024 when it peaked at 72%. In both cases, BTC experienced a significant pullback, leading to the formation of local bottoms. Notably, as the influx of new liquidity dried up during these phases, long-term holders began actively taking profits. This added further pressure on BTC’s price. Currently, while new investor dominance is trending higher, it remains well below the euphoria zone – typically between 60% and 70% – suggesting more upside potential in BTC’s bullish momentum before exhaustion. Meanwhile, older holders continue to sell moderately. The chart indicates a coefficient of 0.3, showing that the supply of three-year-old BTC is still absorbing fresh demand without sharp disruptions. From a long-term perspective, the market remains balanced, and the risk of large-scale capitulation from veteran wallets appears low. AxelAdlerJr concluded: If the indicator’s growth accelerates and approaches the historical corridor of 0.6-0.7, one should expect intensified profit-taking and, consequently, a correction. For now, the supply/demand structure remains in a healthy late bull cycle phase, when new money is coming in but old players have not yet transitioned to mass selling. Is BTC Price About To Stall? While the data above suggests that Bitcoin still has room to grow, other indicators point to waning momentum. One such signal is the recent decline in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap, which has broken its long streak of positive values. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rally Might Be Running on Fumes, Analyst Warns of August Turning Point Fellow CryptoQuant analyst ArabChain confirmed this development in their analysis. They noted that US investor enthusiasm for BTC appears to be cooling at current price levels. That said, positive macroeconomic factors – such as BTC’s historical correlation with global M2 money supply expansion – could still lead the digital asset to new all-time highs in the near term. At press time, BTC trades at $118,371, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

The increased use of the word “dip” on social media suggests retail investors are looking for dip-buying opportunities. However, analyst Brian cautioned against this, noting that markets often move against the crowd's expectations. The 30-day MVRV (market value/realized value) ratio is 1.8%, while the 365-day MVRV is 22%. This suggests a risk of market overheating. Meanwhile, whale wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin have been observed selling approximately 16,500 Bitcoin since July 15th. While these sales were not aggressive, they do not necessarily support a price increase. On the Ethereum side, whales have been buying for the past three weeks. Whales holding more than 10,000 ETH are reported to have added approximately 0.5% of the total supply to their wallets. However, Ethereum's 30-day MVRV is hovering around 14%, while its long-term MVRV is around 36.5%. These high levels suggest the market is in the “danger zone” and may be entering a correction or cooling-off period. Santiment analysts also shared their assessments of various altcoins: XRP: It is noted that the risk has increased in XRP, which is at high levels with a 30-day MVRV of 8.7% and a 365-day MVRV of 45%. Solana: Fear is prevalent in the Solana market, with a low positive/negative comment ratio on social media. SUI: Unlike other assets, SUI's sentiment is quite high. The presence of seven positive comments for every one negative comment indicates a euphoric atmosphere in the market. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces Plans for a Strong New Push into Cryptocurrencies - Here Are the Details In the stablecoin market, Tether (USDT) whale wallets are experiencing significant activity. The percentage of the total Tether supply held in wallets worth $5 million or more has increased from below 50% to over 56.5% in the last five weeks. This could indicate that whales are preparing to inject more money into the market, according to analysts.

2025-07-31 20:55:11,49320907,1753995311,Anthropic AI’s Ascendant Dominance: Overtaking OpenAI in Enterprise AI Market Share,"BitcoinWorld Anthropic AI’s Ascendant Dominance: Overtaking OpenAI in Enterprise AI Market Share The landscape of artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transformation, and for those tracking the pulse of technological innovation, the latest data reveals a compelling shift. In a surprising turn, Anthropic AI models have emerged as the leading choice for enterprises, eclipsing OpenAI in a significant market reversal. This pivotal development not only redefines the competitive dynamics of the AI sector but also offers crucial insights for businesses and investors navigating the rapidly evolving world of advanced technology. Anthropic AI’s Ascendant Dominance: What’s Driving Enterprise Adoption? According to a recent report from Menlo Ventures, Anthropic, the cutting-edge AI research lab, now commands an impressive 32% of the enterprise Large Language Model (LLM) market share by usage. This positions Anthropic firmly ahead of OpenAI, which holds the second-largest share at 25% among enterprises. This shift is particularly striking when viewed against the backdrop of just a couple of years ago. In 2023, OpenAI was the undisputed leader, boasting a dominant 50% of the enterprise market. Anthropic, at that time, held a mere 12%. The intervening period has witnessed a dramatic and consistent reversal, with OpenAI’s enterprise share declining sharply as Anthropic’s has steadily climbed. This trend is not merely statistical; it aligns with growing anecdotal evidence from developers and startups who have increasingly voiced a preference for Anthropic’s Claude models over OpenAI’s offerings for their business applications. A key factor in Anthropic’s rapid ascent is its remarkable stronghold in the domain of coding. The Menlo Ventures report highlights that Anthropic secures a staggering 42% of the enterprise market share for AI-assisted coding, more than double the 21% garnered by OpenAI in the same category. This specialized proficiency suggests that Anthropic’s models are perceived as superior or more finely tuned for the intricate demands of software development within large organizations. This preference in coding isn’t just about raw performance; it often stems from factors like context window size, reduced “hallucinations” (generating factually incorrect or nonsensical information), and the ability to handle complex, multi-turn conversations essential for intricate programming tasks. Enterprises often require models that can maintain coherence and accuracy over extended interactions, a feature where Anthropic’s Claude models appear to excel. Shifting AI Market Share: A New Leader Emerges The foundation for Anthropic’s dramatic surge was reportedly laid with the strategic release of its Claude Sonnet 3.5 model in June 2024. This particular iteration seemingly hit a sweet spot for enterprise requirements, driving significant adoption. The momentum was further amplified by the subsequent introduction of Claude Sonnet 3.7 in February 2025, solidifying Anthropic’s position as a formidable leader in the enterprise AI space. This rapid iteration and successful deployment of new models underscore the fierce competition and the agility required to capture significant AI market share . While Anthropic and OpenAI command the largest portions of the enterprise market, the ecosystem is not static. Google, for instance, has demonstrated consistent growth in enterprise usage for its AI models over recent years, indicating a broader diversification of choices available to businesses. This dynamic environment fosters continuous innovation, as companies vie for dominance by offering more robust, secure, and specialized AI solutions. To better understand the current landscape, consider the following comparison of the two dominant players in the enterprise AI sphere: Feature Anthropic (Claude) OpenAI (ChatGPT Enterprise) Enterprise LLM Market Share (Usage) 32% (Leading) 25% (Second) Coding Market Share (Usage) 42% (Dominant) 21% Key Strengths in Enterprise Complex reasoning, longer context, reduced hallucinations, strong coding capabilities, enterprise-grade focus. Broad applicability, strong general knowledge, API accessibility, early market mover advantage. Consumer Market Presence Growing but less dominant than enterprise. Very strong (2.5B+ prompts/day for ChatGPT). Recent Growth Trajectory Steadily increasing since 2023. Declining in enterprise since 2023. This table illustrates the strategic differentiation emerging between these AI giants. Anthropic’s focus appears to be on delivering deep, reliable capabilities for complex business operations, while OpenAI balances its enterprise efforts with a powerful, widely adopted consumer offering. OpenAI’s Strategic Focus: A Look at the Consumer Side While the narrative in the enterprise sector highlights OpenAI ‘s receding market share, it is vital to contextualize this within their broader strategy. OpenAI continues to hold an unparalleled position in the consumer market. The company recently reported a staggering statistic: users send more than 2.5 billion prompts to ChatGPT every single day. This immense volume of interaction underscores ChatGPT’s pervasive influence and popularity among general consumers, students, and individual professionals. This divergence in market strength—Anthropic leading enterprise, OpenAI dominating consumer—suggests a strategic segmentation. Enterprises typically demand higher levels of data privacy, security, customizability, and robust integration capabilities, often requiring dedicated support and compliance certifications. Anthropic’s development philosophy, often emphasizing “Constitutional AI” for safer and more aligned outputs, might resonate more with these stringent enterprise requirements. Conversely, the consumer market prioritizes ease of access, intuitive user interfaces, and broad utility for everyday tasks, areas where ChatGPT has undeniably excelled. For businesses, understanding this distinction is crucial when selecting an AI partner. A model that performs well in a general consumer context might not possess the specific attributes—like handling proprietary data securely or performing highly specialized coding tasks—that an enterprise requires. The Transformative Power of Large Language Models in Business The Menlo Ventures report also sheds light on a broader, significant trend impacting Enterprise AI adoption: the pronounced preference for closed-source models. The findings indicate that more than half of the surveyed enterprises explicitly stated they do not utilize open-source models at all. Furthermore, the percentage of enterprise daily workloads relying on open-source models has notably decreased from 19% at the beginning of 2025 to a mere 13% by mid-year 2025. This strong inclination towards proprietary, often more secure, and commercially supported AI solutions from providers like Anthropic and OpenAI signals a maturing enterprise market where stability, security, and dedicated support are paramount. Despite this overarching preference, Meta continues to maintain its leadership in the open-source AI market. This suggests that while the majority of enterprises opt for closed systems, a significant segment still values the flexibility, transparency, and community-driven innovation offered by open-source alternatives. The choice between open and closed models often involves a careful balance of factors: the desire for greater control and customization inherent in open-source solutions versus the robust support, security guarantees, and pre-trained capabilities typically found in closed models. Regardless of the chosen model type, the benefits that advanced Large Language Models bring to the enterprise are undeniable and transformative: Enhanced Operational Efficiency: LLMs can automate a wide array of repetitive and complex tasks, from drafting reports and summarizing documents to generating code and responding to customer inquiries, significantly reducing manual effort and accelerating workflows. Accelerated Innovation: By providing powerful tools for research, design, and content generation, LLMs enable businesses to innovate faster, develop new products, and explore novel solutions with unprecedented speed. Superior Customer and Employee Experiences: Personalized chatbots, intelligent assistants, and advanced knowledge management systems powered by LLMs can deliver highly tailored and efficient interactions, boosting satisfaction for both customers and internal teams. Deeper Data-Driven Insights: LLMs can process and analyze vast quantities of unstructured data—such as customer feedback, market reports, and internal communications—to uncover valuable insights that inform strategic decision-making. Cost Optimization: Automation and efficiency gains brought by LLMs can lead to significant cost reductions in areas like customer support, content creation, and software development. Navigating the Enterprise AI Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities For businesses looking to implement or expand their Enterprise AI capabilities, the recent shifts in market dynamics, particularly Anthropic’s rise, provide critical insights. It’s clear that mere computational power is no longer the sole determinant of success; rather, it’s the ability of an LLM to seamlessly integrate into existing workflows, address specific industry challenges, and provide reliable, secure performance that truly drives adoption. However, the journey of AI adoption within enterprises is not without its challenges: Data Privacy and Security: Handling sensitive proprietary data with AI models requires robust security protocols and adherence to evolving regulatory frameworks. Integration Complexity: Integrating LLMs into existing IT infrastructure and applications can be complex, requiring significant technical expertise and resources. Talent Gap: A shortage of skilled AI engineers and data scientists can hinder effective deployment and optimization of AI solutions. Cost Management: The computational resources required for large-scale LLM deployment and inference can be substantial, necessitating careful cost-benefit analysis. Ethical AI Governance: Ensuring fair, unbiased, and transparent AI operations is crucial to maintaining trust and avoiding reputational risks. Actionable Insights for Strategic AI Adoption: Conduct a Thorough Needs Assessment: Before committing to an LLM provider, meticulously evaluate your specific business needs, use cases, and existing technical infrastructure. A general-purpose model might suffice for some tasks, while others demand specialized capabilities like those offered by Anthropic for coding. Prioritize Data Governance and Security: Given the strong preference for closed models, ensure your chosen AI partner offers robust data encryption, privacy controls, and compliance certifications relevant to your industry and region. Assess Integration Capabilities: Evaluate the ease of integration through APIs, SDKs, and compatibility with your current software ecosystem. A smooth integration process minimizes disruption and accelerates time-to-value.

According to the company, the Coinbase Premium Index is currently in the negative. This index measures the difference between Bitcoin's price on US-based exchanges like Coinbase and its price on other global exchanges. A negative index means Bitcoin is trading at a discount on Coinbase, meaning it's lower. This could indicate selling pressure or waning interest among US-based investors. Related News: Visa Announces It Has Added Two Altcoin Networks to Its Payment Infrastructure - One of Them Is XRP's Biggest Competitor Alphractal notes that historically, negative premiums often coincide with periods when US investors are taking profits or market interest is waning.

2025-07-31 20:53:37,49320901,1753995217,Coinbase Q2 earnings miss Wall Street estimates with disappointing numbers,"Coinbase failed Wall Street’s expectations in Q2 2025, pulling in $1.5 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in net income instead of the projected $1.6 billion, according to the company’s quarterly filing. The figures include a $1.5 billion unrealized gain from strategic investments and another $362 million from its crypto holdings. Even without those, Adjusted Net Income stood at $33 million, and Adjusted EBITDA reached $512 million. Transaction revenue came in at $764 million, while subscriptions and services brought in $656 million, fueled by rising USDC balances, increased staking activity, and record Prime Financing balances. By the end of June, Coinbase had $9.3 billion in U.S. dollar resources and $1.8 billion in crypto assets held for investment, thanks to consistent weekly Bitcoin purchases. Its stock fell 6% in extended trading. Coinbase holds 11,776 Bitcoin worth $1.26 billion. Coinbase rolls out new derivatives, boosts app platform, and targets payments Coinbase also continued expanding USDC usage by integrating it into Shopify Payments, Coinbase Business, and the Coinbase One Card. These moves brought stablecoin utility closer to daily consumer spending. The company said average USDC balances rose 13% from the last quarter, reaching $13.8 billion, helped by the reintroduction of a rewards program. As part of its lending efforts, Coinbase grew its Prime Financing operation to new highs, serving corporates, miners, hedge funds, and asset managers. According to the company, 16 of its 25 biggest institutional clients now use its financing tools. The firm also offered retail users up to $1 million in instant USDC loans, backed by BTC and settled on-chain through the Morpho protocol. Those loans now exceed $1 billion in open collateral. Meanwhile, Shopify merchants across the U.S. are now able to accept USDC, and customers who use it get 1% back in rewards, with a full rollout expected later this year. Q2 operating expenses spiked by $193 million, or 15%, mostly due to a $307 million charge linked to the data breach that was revealed in May. However, other major costs (tech, admin, and marketing) dropped 2%, totaling $977 million. Coinbase reported a full-time headcount of 4,279 employees. Although the company’s total dollar resources dropped 6% quarter-over-quarter, ending at $9.3 billion, Coinbase still has access to $12.1 billion when counting its crypto held for investment and as loan collateral. Of that, $951 million was held as collateral, and the company added $222 million in BTC during the quarter through routine weekly buys. Custody operations also scaled up. Coinbase now holds $245.7 billion in crypto under custody, the highest share of global crypto market cap it’s ever had. It also manages over 80% of all BTC and ETH ETF assets based in the U.S. New crypto laws and tokenized assets set the stage for the next phase Coinbase’s quarter closed as Washington began loosening up on crypto regulation under the Trump administration. In July, Congress passed the CLARITY Act , and President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law. The two bills give regulatory clarity for stablecoins and crypto market structure, a win for Coinbase and its long-term roadmap. At the same time, the company announced plans for an “everything exchange” that brings tokenized stocks, real-world assets, derivatives, and prediction markets on-chain. Max Branzburg, Coinbase’s VP of Product, said the rollout will start in the U.S. and expand globally once jurisdictions give the green light. “We’re building an exchange for everything,” Max said in an interview with CNBC. “Everything you want to trade, in a one-stop shop, on-chain. … We’re bringing all assets onchain—stocks, prediction markets, and more.” CEO Brian Armstrong said he wants Coinbase to be the top financial app in the world over the next decade. That includes pushing further into consumer tools, expanding tokenized products, and using new regulatory support to go global faster. As for Q3, Coinbase expects transaction revenue for July to hit $360 million. Full quarter projections show $665 to $745 million in subscription and service revenue, driven by USDC’s record market cap and higher crypto prices. Tech and admin costs are expected between $800 and $850 million, with marketing expenses ranging from $190 to $290 million, depending on performance-based campaigns and USDC user engagement.

According to a new CryptoQuant report, several key indicators are pointing to a possible “altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance, which measures BTC’s market share, has dropped sharply. The metric fell by over 6.3% in recent weeks and is now sitting at around 60.5%, the lowest level since March. 2025 Altseason? Altcoins are heating up after Bitcoin’s breakout to ~$120K. For example, Ethereum is up +170% from the recent lows and just ~23% from its ATH at $4,871. Here are 6 key charts showing this market shift pic.twitter.com/8fUZELmhMy — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 31, 2025 This decline often indicates a shift in market focus from Bitcoin to altcoins. Analysts say the pattern is playing out similar to 2021, when Ethereum and other tokens began to surge after Bitcoin led the initial rally. Ethereum Rallies 56% in a Month Amid Growing Institutional Confidence Ethereum (ETH) has posted a 56% gain in the past month alone and is now trading around $3,854. It is only 23% away from reclaiming its all-time high of $4,871. Much of the renewed interest in ETH has been fueled by institutional demand for Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming confirmed last week it now holds 438,190 ETH, worth approximately $1.6 billion, with over 95% being staked or earning yield through liquid staking platforms. The company added over 77,000 ETH in a single week, spending $290 million at an average price of $3,756. Its ETH concentration has jumped 70% since early June. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies now leads all corporate holders with over 625,000 ETH as part of its growing $2.3 billion ETH treasury. Together, 65 institutions now hold 2.33 million ETH, worth $8.9 billion, accounting for 1.93% of Ethereum’s total supply , according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve (SER). Holdings have surged since April, with a noticeable spike in late June, reflecting growing institutional confidence in ETH as a treasury asset. This renewed interest coincides with Ethereum gaining strength against Bitcoin, as the ETH/BTC pair shows signs of upward momentum, an early signal often associated with the onset of altcoin-led rallies. Supporting this trend, CryptoQuant reports that ETH and altcoin futures volume recently reached $223.6 billion, marking the highest level in five months and reinforcing the narrative of renewed bullish interest in the broader altcoin market. Source: CryptoQuant “Altcoins are seeing heavy trading,” the firm stated. It also noted that Ethereum perpetual futures volume dominance has overtaken Bitcoin for the first time since 2022. ETH futures open interest climbed to $58 billion, with volume doubling since late June. CryptoQuant observed that altcoins and ETH now make up 83% of total futures volume, while BTC accounts for just 17%. At the same time, retail interest is picking up again. Transactions under $10,000 are up 9.7% over the past 30 days. Historically, this metric has surged ahead of major rallies in both Bitcoin and altcoins. CryptoQuant explained, “This increase aligns with psychological thresholds being crossed in BTC price, drawing in smaller investors and speculators.” The overall crypto market has added nearly $900 billion in value over the past three weeks, pushing the total market cap to $3.9 trillion. Altcoin Season Index Nearly Doubles as Market Rotation Intensifies Alongside Ethereum’s rally, other major altcoins are also on the rise. BNB is up 23% over 30 days, Solana has gained more than 21%, and XRP is up 44%. Meme coins are having their moment too, with BONK jumping 148% and FLOKI climbing 119%. Even lower-cap tokens are outperforming, with PENGU and SPX both posting gains of over 250%. Out of 424 futures trading pairs on Binance, only 23 posted losses since Bitcoin broke its all-time high, showing that over 94% of the altcoin market has reacted positively. Veteran trader Merlijn said Bitcoin dominance has entered “Phase 4″—a breakdown stage. “This is the biggest sign of an Altseason and upcoming parabolic pump,” said Ash Crypto , another analyst. A key technical indicator is also flashing. Bitcoin dominance has formed a bearish cross on the three-week chart and broken a three-year uptrend line. This breakdown suggests that Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market is losing strength, which historically leads to capital rotation into altcoins. The rise in ETH futures open interest to $58 billion, up from just $20 billion in April, is further proof of this momentum. In fact, this is more than what it was when ETH traded near $4,000 last December. Analysts see this as a strong sign of fresh capital entering the Ethereum market. Meanwhile, Ether’s open interest dominance has risen to 40%, a level rarely seen. Glassnode data also confirms that Ethereum futures volume has overtaken Bitcoin’s—another major first since 2022. #Ethereum open interest dominance has climbed to nearly 40%, its highest level since April 2023. Only 5% of days have seen a higher reading. This marks a clear shift in speculative focus, with capital rotating from $BTC to $ETH at the margin. pic.twitter.com/yNKLe9gJKt — glassnode (@glassnode) July 29, 2025 While a full-fledged altseason has not been confirmed, many indicators suggest the market is entering a new phase. As traders eye these structural shifts, the next few weeks could set the tone for a broad altcoin rally in the second half of 2025.

2025-07-31 20:32:55,49319951,1753993975,CoinDCX Software Engineer Arrested in Connection to $44 Million Hack (Report),"The Indian exchange is the latest victim of bad actors exploiting vulnerabilities and taking control of internal systems, resulting in millions of dollars being lost. The losses this year, overall, are already in the billions, and, regrettably, continue to increase at an alarming pace. Details on What Happened A local Indian news outlet, The Times of India, shared the story about Rahul Agarwal, a staff member of the CoinDCX exchange, whose login information was compromised. He has been taken into custody by Bengaluru authorities, reportedly linked to a ₹379-crore ($44 million) exploit of funds. The alarm was raised following a complaint by Nebilo Technologies, the company that runs the exchange. Their Vice President for public policy, Hardeep Singh, stated the following: “Rahul had a permanent role within the company, and he was provided with a laptop strictly for work. Our investigation began after we discovered that an unknown person had gained unauthorized access to our systems on July 19th, around 2:30 am, by transferring 1 USDT to an external wallet. Several hours later, around 9:30 a.m., the $44 million was siphoned off and distributed among six wallets. During his questioning by the police, Agarwal maintained his innocent stance, claiming he knew nothing about the hack. However, he did admit to “moonlighting” (working a second job outside regular business hours) with three to four private parties, without thoroughly vetting them. It’s further noted that the accused received ₹15 lakh (~$17,000) in his personal bank account from an unknown source. The Bengaluru police also point out that Agarwal claimed to have received a phone call from a German phone number, stating he “had a few files to complete.” He believes one of those files was fitted with malware, which granted the attackers access to CoinDCX’s internal systems, and he remained adamant that he was unaware of what was happening until the company summoned him. The exchange’s founder and CEO, Sumit Gupta, shared the bitter news of the attack on X, calling it a “sophisticated social engineering attack,” but without being able to disclose any further information on what had transpired. Some media reports have surfaced referencing the FIR we filed with the Karnataka Police regarding the security incident that impacted our platform. As this is an ongoing investigation, we unfortunately cannot engage with the media or public on this issue. We want to ensure the… — Sumit Gupta (CoinDCX) (@smtgpt) July 31, 2025 Hefty Losses Unfortunately, the attacks on crypto exchanges are on the rise, increasing in complexity, and the damage to their coffers is significant. The most notable example is the hack on Bybit in February, which resulted in a $1.5 billion loss, linked to the North Korean Lazarus Group. Overall, 2025 has seen enormous amounts of funds stolen, topping records from previous years only during the first half of the year. These incidents serve as an example of how geopolitical tensions, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and sophisticated adversaries continue to pose a significant risk to even well-established cryptocurrency platforms.

August has been bitcoin's weakest month over the past decade, with only three positive years and others delivering 5–20% losses, the report noted. The report also flagged a slowdown in capital flows into the Bitcoin network, a key driver of price action this year. Total cumulative inflows into the network now exceed $1 trillion, with $206 billion arriving in 2025. But the 30‑day rolling average slipped from $62.4 billion to $59.3 billion, that could mark the start of a consolidation phase, the report said, mirroring past peaks in this metric like in Q1 and Q4 2024. “Time is running short, and despite billions in capital inflows from corporate treasuries, the actual price impact has been surprisingly muted,” wrote Markus Thielen, co-founder and lead analyst at 10x. “This raises the possibility that even with continued support, the market may fall short of delivering the kind of upside many are hoping for.” The report forecasts a likely break below $117,000, with support at $112,000 and a deeper floor around the $106,000–$110,000 threshold.

2025-07-31 20:30:52,49320467,1753993852,Grayscale Launches Story Trust to Back Blockchain-Based IP,"Grayscale, the world’s largest digital asset-focused investment firm, has taken a bold new step into the future of digital rights and artificial intelligence (AI). On July 31, the company announced the launch of the Grayscale Story Trust. This new fund provides accredited investors with a direct investment opportunity in IP, the token powering the Story network. This blockchain platform is built to redefine intellectual property (IP) for the AI era. A Shift From Fragmented Systems to Programmable Assets According to Grayscale , Story is not just another blockchain project. It is designed to make intellectual property programmable, traceable, and enforceable on-chain. As AI systems become smarter and more widespread, there is a growing need for trusted, licensed data. Story helps solve this by building legal and licensing rules directly into smart contract-based tokens. This makes it easier for creators, companies, and even AI systems to register, remix, and monetize IP safely and legally. Furthermore, Traditional IP systems are usually slow, complicated, and often rely on many middlemen. They are not made for today’s fast-moving digital world. Story offers a new solution by turning IP into programmable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These digital collectibles include built-in rules for ownership, usage, and royalties. Grayscale’s Story Attracts Strong Interest and Real-World Use Story is gaining traction, with over 1.7 million IP transactions already completed on the network. Reportedly, the new network service now supports more than 200,000 monthly users. Users range from global brands and artists to advanced AI platforms. The network also supports unique projects like Poseidon. This project delivers real-world data to intelligent machines, including robots, autonomous vehicles, and medical assistants. With the IP token now offered through a Grayscale Trust, investors have a new way to join the movement toward programmable ownership. Grayscale Opens New Door to the $80 Trillion IP Economy Intangible assets like IP and software are now worth over $80 trillion worldwide, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization’s 2025 Global Innovation Index. As more creators and companies seek to control and monetize their digital assets, platforms like Story provide a modern and scalable solution. The Grayscale Story Trust is now open for daily subscription by accredited investors. It operates similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset trusts and holds only IP tokens. It is important to note that this investment comes with risks. Like other private placements, the IP token is speculative and not easy to sell. Grayscale, currently processing to go public , emphasized that digital assets can be very volatile. Also, there is no promise that the Trust’s shares will be traded on any secondary market. Investors are advised to hold their shares for a long time, and there is even the possibility that they may lose their entire investment.

2025-07-31 20:29:51,49319828,1753993791,Best Non-Custodial Wallets for Crypto in 2025 (With Pros & Cons),"“Not your keys, not your crypto.” What began as a rallying cry among early Bitcoiners is now a principle backed by billions in lost user funds and a decade of crypto evolution. These secure and versatile wallet options will help you manage crypto on your terms—below are our top picks. In crypto, ownership is defined by access to private keys. When your assets sit on a centralized exchange or in a custodial wallet, they’re not truly yours—you’re trusting a third party to act in your interest and remain solvent. History has shown how fragile that trust can be. In 2022, $3.7 billion in customer funds were lost in the collapse of custodial platforms like Voyager, BlockFi, and Zipmex—with users often ranking below institutional creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. When FTX filed for bankruptcy, over 1 million users lost access to their accounts overnight—despite having full balances visible in the app. Why Going Non-Custodial? By contrast, users holding funds in non-custodial wallets were unaffected: no lockups, no withdrawals paused — an uninterrupted ownership. In 2025, the tools for self-custody are faster, safer, and more intuitive than ever before. Whether you're swapping tokens across chains, holding stablecoins, or exploring DeFi, the best non-custodial wallets give you complete control—without compromising usability. This guide ranks the most powerful and accessible wallets today based on security, UX, chain support, and smart DeFi features, including options for beginners and advanced users alike. 1. AliceBob Wallet — Overall Best Non‑Custodial Wallet Why it leads: Truly self‑custodial, with private keys generated and stored on your device only—no server access by AliceBob Adheres to OWASP MASVS and uses advanced cryptographic methods (BIP32/39/44) for hierarchical deterministic wallets to protect your digital assets from security risks. Supports 1,000+ assets across 300+ chains, including Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism—higher than most competitors, with built‑in fiat purchase and cross‑chain swaps Smart swap and fiat on-ramp aggregator, real‑time insights, token-level analytics, and UX designed for both beginners and power users 2. Exodus Wallet — Best for DeFi & Browser-Based dApp Access Best for: Aesthetic multi‑chain support with integrated swaps Non‑custodial: you alone hold the private keys and recovery phrase Supports 100+ blockchains, including Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche, and more Supports staking, NFT viewing, and hundreds of tokens via built‑in exchange providers but no DEX aggregator; recently added XOPay card integration for native crypto purchases inside the wallet Great UI, among the best in the market, but fewer advanced swap and fiat on-ramp aggregate features compared to AliceBob 3. MyEtherWallet (MEW) — Best for Ethereum Purists & Open-Source Accountability Best for: Ethereum-native users and open‑source purists One of the original Ethereum wallets, fully non-custodial and open-source Accessible via mobile, web, or extension, though focused almost exclusively on Ethereum ecosystem Allows ENS integration, NFT management, and hardware wallet access (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) Strong community trust and educational onboarding for beginners 4. Gem Wallet — Best for XRP Ledger Users Best for: XRP Ledger users and lightweight DeFi access Non‑custodial: private keys stored locally with zero server access Offers intuitive interface, biometric lock, and open‑source ethos Clean option for XRP ecosystem users and DeFi adopters Great for fast transfers and small transactions but lacks broader multichain utility 5. Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) — Best for Multisig & Shared Control Best for: shared wallets, DAOs, and team use cases Non‑custodial multisignature wallet: no single point of control Integrates with dozens of protocols and hardware wallets, compatible with EVM chains like Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Arbitrum, and Polygon Supports modular plugins, smart contract automation, and integrations with WalletConnect and hardware wallets Offers multi-user security governance and multisig flexibility; setup and gas fees can be a barrier for solo users Side-by-Side Comparison Wallet Custody Key Storage Chain Support Notable Features Best For AliceBob Wallet Non-Custodial Local (user device) 300+ chains incl. Solana, XRP, ETH Smart aggregator, fiat onramp, gas analytics, token insights Overall Best Exodus Wallet Non-Custodial Local 100+ incl. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Staking, XOPay, Trezor support, NFT portfolio DeFi users & UI-focused holders MyEtherWallet (MEW) Non-Custodial Local Ethereum & ERC-20 tokens Open-source, ENS, hardware wallet support, smart contract interaction Ethereum-native users & open-source advocates Gem Wallet Non-Custodial Local XRP Ledger Biometric auth, DEX access, xApp integration XRP ecosystem Safe (Gnosis Safe) Non-Custodial Multisig (smart contract) EVM-compatible Multisig governance, plugin architecture, DAO tools Shared wallets, treasury managers, DAOs Final Verdict AliceBob Wallet takes the top spot for offering a rare balance: advanced features like cross-chain swaps and real-time gas insights with a UX accessible to beginners. Its support for 300+ chains makes it the most versatile all-around pick for 2025. Exodus Wallet is best suited for users who want an elegant interface, built-in fiat and NFT tools, and a non-technical entry point into self-custody. MyEtherWallet (MEW) remains the go-to for Ethereum purists who value open-source code, transparency, and long-standing trust in the ETH ecosystem. Gem Wallet is ideal for XRP users wanting a clean, biometric-secured wallet tailored for the XRP Ledger. Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) leads for shared governance and team-based wallets, thanks to multisig architecture trusted by DAOs and institutions.

The Helium team, whose project is powered by the Solana blockchain, says the new solution marks a significant step toward expanding community-driven wireless coverage. Helium’s announcement could be a major boost to the HNT token . Helium targets growth with new Helium Plus service On July 31, 2025, Helium made a huge announcement . The platform announced the launch of Helium Plus, a transformative service designed to integrate existing Wi-Fi networks into its people-powered Helium Network. According to a blog post, the project aims to eliminate the need for businesses to invest in specialized hardware, such as physical Hotspots, as they look to join the network. This is a previous requirement businesses had to comply with before contributing to the network. Helium🎈 @helium · Follow Introducing Helium Plus: Empowering Everyone to Participate ➕Turn your existing Wi-Fi into a revenue stream! Instantly join the people-powered Network with a simple software upgrade – no new hardware needed. Expand coverage & earn.Read the news: blog.helium.com/helium-plus-51… 9:42 PM · Jul 31, 2025 86 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies Helium Plus removes this need, allowing venues such as coffee shops or shopping centers to join the network via a simple software upgrade. This tweak applies to users’ Wi-Fi routers, with a seamless integration set to significantly lower the barriers that have impacted participation. “Helium Plus represents a major leap forward in how businesses can contribute to the Helium Network,” said Mario Di Dio, general manager at Helium. “It offers instant, low-cost wireless integration, reducing infrastructure costs while creating new revenue streams and improving connectivity. The simplicity of our process is key to unlocking the full potential of this expansion.” Helium says the new feature will accelerate growth and availability of reliable Wi-Fi coverage. Key markets in this community-driven wireless initiative are the United States and Mexico. Coverage and reduced costs Helium Plus aims to enable a broader range of businesses to provide wireless coverage and share in the network’s success. Monetizing these offerings can allow businesses to earn HNT or US dollars. Helium’s payouts for carrier offload data were $300k in June, with rewards increasing by 20% month-over-month. In April this year, Helium revealed a strategic collaboration with American communications giant AT&T. The partnership targeted bringing Helium’s decentralized wireless network to AT&T subscribers in the US, with AT&T customers able to tap into Helium for community-built Wi-Fi connection. Helium and AT&T said at the time the goal was to expand coverage and bolster mobile service. “Beyond creating value for individual businesses, Helium Plus is designed to supercharge the entire Helium ecosystem. It directly fuels the Helium Network’s powerful carrier offload capability, which enables major US carriers to route customer data through The People’s Network,enhancing their coverage and cutting operational costs,” the platform wrote.

2025-07-31 20:24:22,49319624,1753993462,Coinbase Stock Tumbles 7% After Disappointing Q2 Results,"Coinbase (COIN) reported worse than expected second-quarter results on Thursday, sending its shares down 7% in post-market trading. The crypto exchange posted total revenue of $1.5 billion, up from $1.45 billion in the same quarter last year but slightly lower than FactSet estimates of $1.59 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) came in at $512 million, down from $596 million a year ago. The results show Coinbase’s continued sensitivity to crypto market cycles. Even though bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied to new yearly highs during the second quarter, transaction volume fell from a quarter-to-quarter basis, Coinbase said in a press release. As a result, transaction revenue was $764 million, a 39% drop from the first quarter. Coinbase’s report follows an upbeat performance from rival Robinhood (HOOD), which reported its own quarterly results on Wednesday. HOOD, which is up 160% year-to-date, beat expectations as the company saw $28.3 billion in crypto trading volume in the second quarter. Coinbase, meanwhile, continues to lean into its dual identity as both a retail trading hub and institutional crypto infrastructure provider. The company has launched custody services for spot bitcoin ETFs, expanded its staking offerings and made further progress with its Base layer-2 network, though these businesses remain secondary to trading revenue. “In Q2, Coinbase made significant strides in bringing the financial system onchain by expanding access to trading through innovative derivative products, listing more spot assets, and expanding our offerings in markets globally,” the company said in its earnings release.",Markets|Coinbase|Earnings|News,EN,0,coinbase coin reported worse expected result thursday sending share trading crypto exchange posted total revenue billion billion quarter last year slightly lower factset estimate billion adjusted earnings interest tax depreciation amortization ebitda came million million year ago result show coinbase continued sensitivity crypto market cycle even though bitcoin btc ether eth rallied new yearly high second quarter transaction volume fell basis coinbase said press release result transaction revenue million drop first quarter coinbase report follows upbeat performance rival robinhood hood reported quarterly result wednesday hood beat expectation company saw billion crypto trading volume second quarter coinbase meanwhile continues lean dual identity retail trading hub institutional crypto infrastructure provider company launched custody service spot bitcoin etf expanded staking offering made progress base network though business remain secondary trading revenue coinbase made significant stride bringing financial system onchain expanding access trading innovative derivative product listing spot asset expanding offering market globally company said earnings release,0.042,0.835,0.123,0.8932,1

2025-07-31 20:24:00,49319705,1753993440,Pepe Price Prediction: Whale Selling Triggers Huge Drop – Panic Is Spreading Fast,"Pepe (PEPE) has dropped 9% over the past 7 days, underperforming most other meme coins during the latest pullback — putting the current Pepe price prediction into question. Is this a sign of deeper weakness and a bearish mid-term outlook, or just a healthy correction before the next leg up? Data from CoinDesk Research shows that whales have been offloading PEPE recently, although not all of these sales appear to be voluntary, hinting at liquidations or forced exits rather than broad loss of confidence. Whale James Wynn got liquidated again. This time he was long on $PEPE . Tough to watch him lose that much. pic.twitter.com/aSNZJbpOfA — Ted (@TedPillows) July 29, 2025 A notable PEPE trader called James Wynn, who previously made a fortune by buying the meme coin once it was an unknown token for the rest of the world, was recently liquidated out of a long position. A total of $207 million worth of long positions were impacted by PEPE’s latest drop, inflicting losses of around $180,000 to Wynn in a relatively short period. This trader, known for his high-risk strategy, has seen both massive wins and painful losses. While his approach once delivered life-changing returns, the tides have turned — he was forced out of a $1 billion Bitcoin position in May, reportedly losing around $60 million. PEPE’s open interest has also taken a hit. After peaking at $1 billion on July 22, it has since plunged sharply, suggesting that many traders — possibly similar to Wynn — have been wiped out during PEPE’s 21.4% drop from $0.000014 to $0.000011. This wave of forced exits raises a critical question: Is whale capitulation an early warning sign of a deeper correction ahead? And with price action breaking key levels, does the current structure support a bearish PEPE price prediction for the mid-term? Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Drop to $0.00000850 If It Breaks Below This Key Support Pepe’s daily chart shows that the price started to retreat upon hitting the $0.00001450 mark and dropped below the 200-day exponential moving average in the past few days. Now, the 9-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have made a ‘death cross’ as they crossed below their long-term peer. This favors a bearish Pepe price prediction and could mark the beginning of a pronounced downtrend. The key support to watch at this point is the $0.00001050 area. If PEPE breaks below this level, the odds would favor a push to a much higher zone – possibly at around $0.00000850. However, since market sentiment and momentum still favor a bullish outlook, short-selling PEPE at this point would be risky as it means going against the prevailing trend. A confirmed breakout below $0.00001050 would justify taking a short position. Whether you believe that PEPE will drop to these low levels or the opposite, you can profit from your prediction through a new crypto futures trading platform called CoinFutures that lets you take directional positions on your favorite cryptocurrencies without the hassle of doing real trading. CoinFutures Supports Auto Trading Features and Offers 1000X Leverage to Boost Gains CoinFutures allows users to profit from the future price movements of top cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) without buying these cryptocurrencies directly. Meme coins like PEPE will be added to the platform shortly as well. The platform mimics the real-time volatility and price action of the crypto market through a sophisticated algorithm and integrations with top exchanges to offer transparent pricing. Users can use a price multiplier feature to take much larger positions and potentially increase their profits if the market moves in their favor. Moreover, an auto trading tool can be used to set a stop-loss and take-profit target to limit losses and cash out when the position turns a profit. To open an account, simply head to the CoinFutures website and click the “Register” button. You can deposit money via crypto transfers of USDT, USDC, ETH, and more or use a bank card.

2025-07-31 20:23:45,49320835,1753993425,Stellar (XLM) August outlook as bullish pennant forms,"Stellar (XLM) is entering the month of August on a strong technical footing, following weeks of momentum driven by both major adoption news and emerging bullish indicators. As the token trades at around $0.40, analysts and traders are closely watching a textbook bullish pennant formation, a pattern often associated with price continuation after a rally. And with market sentiment gradually turning positive, XLM could be on the verge of a significant breakout. Bullish pennant signals a possible rally ahead The price of XLM has been consolidating between converging trendlines, forming a bullish pennant — a structure that typically emerges after a steep upward move. This consolidation suggests that the asset is gearing up for its next leg higher. Currently, Stellar (XLM) is holding steady at $0.40, trading within a narrow range that reflects market indecision but also growing pressure for a directional move. If the token breaks above the upper trendline of the pennant, a strong rally could follow. The first target is the July 18 high of $0.52. Stellar (XLM) price analysis | Source: TradingView Should bullish momentum continue, the price could then attempt to reach the November 2023 high of $0.63. The fact that this setup is forming after recent positive developments adds more weight to the bullish outlook. Visa integration lends strong fundamental support One of the most notable developments supporting XLM is its recent integration into Visa’s blockchain settlement network. Visa, a global payments giant, has added Stellar to its platform alongside Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This move allows stablecoin payments to be settled directly on Stellar’s blockchain, aligning perfectly with the project’s long-term goals of improving cross-border payment efficiency. This partnership could prove to be a major driver of adoption for Stellar. It also places the project in direct competition with XRP, a fellow cross-border payment solution that continues to face legal uncertainty in the United States. By contrast, Stellar now enjoys the backing of one of the most influential financial entities in the world, potentially giving it a competitive edge in institutional finance. Smart money is moving in as retail traders stay calm While many retail traders remain on the sidelines, on-chain data shows that institutional interest in XLM is increasing. Metrics suggest that smart money is quietly accumulating the token during this consolidation phase. Historically, low retail activity has preceded some of Stellar’s most significant rallies, as institutions take advantage of calmer market conditions to build positions. The derivatives market also reflects growing optimism. The long/short ratio for Stellar (XLM), according to Coinglass , recently hit 1.14, its highest in over a month, signalling that more traders are betting on upside. Additionally, the funding rate is positive at 0.0085%, indicating that long positions are dominant and confident. Technical indicators back the bullish Stellar (XLM) outlook Aside from the bullish pennant, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has dropped to around 52, coming from an overbought region, providing room for a substantial comeback. XLM also has clear support levels that may serve as strong accumulation zones.

These new services will launch over the next few months, initially for US users, followed by a phased rollout internationally, subject to regulatory approvals, the company told CNBC today. “We’re building an all-encompassing exchange,” Coinbase Vice President of Product Max Branzburg said, explaining the company’s vision. “We’re bringing all assets on-chain: stocks, prediction markets, and more.” He added, “We’re building an on-chain, one-stop-shop for everything tradable.” Related News: BREAKING: Strategy Takes New Step Worth $4.2 Billion in Bitcoin The new services will include tokenized real-world assets, stocks, derivatives, prediction markets, and early-stage token sales. This move positions Coinbase directly against tokenized securities services offered by rivals like Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken, particularly outside the US. CEO Brian Armstrong aims to make the company “the most preferred financial services app” within the next decade. Coinbase’s announcement came just hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled its “Project Crypto” initiative, which aims to modernize regulations for crypto-based trading activities. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-31 10:17:43,49320601,1753957063,"PowerBank and Intellistake Announce Strategic Alliance To Pioneer Digital Currencies, Including Bitcoin Treasury Integration and RWA Tokenization","July 31, 2025 – Vancouver, British Columbia PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN; Cboe CA: SUNN, FSE: 103) (‘PowerBank’ or the ‘Company’) announces a transaction with Intellistake Technologies Corp. (‘Intellistake’) that involves the intersection of digital assets, energy and tokenized finance. Intellistake (CSE: ISTK) is a technology company bridging traditional capital markets with decentralized AI and blockchain infrastructure, and PowerBank (formerly SolarBank), is a leader in clean energy infrastructure. Together, these two high-growth companies will pursue three seminal initiatives. A digital asset treasury program – Leveraging Bitcoin as a long-term treasury reserve asset, PowerBank, with Intellistake’s support, intends to accumulate and hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet and Intellistake intends to accumulate digital assets that support decentralized AI, such as FET Token, aligning with the global shift toward decentralized financial reserves. Bitcoin treasury management – Under the partnership framework, Intellistake will help manage digital asset operations for PowerBank and serve as PowerBank’s supporting partner for security, custody and treasury management of Bitcoin. The tokenization of RWAs (real-world assets) – Intellistake and PowerBank are evaluating the potential tokenization of PowerBank’s clean energy assets or shares, providing an investment and financing alternative. Jason Dussault, CEO of Intellistake, said, “Tokenization is no longer a concept – it’s an inevitability. “By combining our expertise in capital markets and digital asset custody with PowerBank’s scalable, real-world energy platform, we’re unlocking a new opportunity.” As institutions and sovereign funds increasingly embrace tokenized securities and decentralized asset strategies, the Intellistake-PowerBank partnership centers on transforming legacy energy systems into a tokenized product. According to a recent report by CryptoSlate, analysts forecast that the market cap for tokenized RWAs could reach $30 trillion by 2034 – driven by advances in blockchain, AI and investor demand for transparent, real-time asset ownership and settlement. Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank, said, “This partnership is about more than collaboration – it’s about setting the pace for a shift in how companies manage capital and assets. “As the world accelerates toward AI, automation and clean energy, Bitcoin and tokenization are presenting new opportunities. “PowerBank and Intellistake are here to take part in that transformation – to bridge traditional energy infrastructure with the demand of the digital economy.” Intellistake and PowerBank are presently evaluating the regulatory framework for tokenization. Any tokenization will be subject to it being completed in compliance with applicable law, regulatory requirements and terms of any underlying agreements associated with PowerBank assets. The actual structure of such tokenization, the assets that would be subject to tokenization and the associated timeline have not yet been determined. Intellistake and PowerBank will provide further updates as material developments related to this tokenization strategy occur. The actual timing and value of Bitcoin purchases, under the allocation strategy will be determined by management. Purchases will also depend on several factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of Bitcoin and the anticipated cash needs of Intellistake or PowerBank. The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason. Intellistake will support PowerBank’s establishment of custody for its digital currency purchases and PowerBank no longer intends to utilize Coinbase for this service. As of the date of this press release, no Bitcoin purchases have been made. About Intellistake For additional information on the business of Intellistake, please refer to the website .

2025-07-31 10:15:10,49293851,1753956910,"Ethereum Price Analysis: Unleashing ETH’s Remarkable $4,900 Potential","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price Analysis: Unleashing ETH’s Remarkable $4,900 Potential The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with renewed optimism, and Ethereum (ETH) is once again taking center stage. After a notable rebound, ETH has climbed back to levels near its March 2024 high of $3,980. This impressive recovery has naturally captured the attention of investors worldwide. However, a deeper dive into on-chain data, courtesy of leading analytics firm Glassnode, reveals an even more intriguing picture: despite this price surge, unrealized profits among ETH holders remain surprisingly low. This fascinating disparity isn’t just a minor detail; it’s a powerful signal that could point to substantial upside potential for Ethereum, with some analysts eyeing a possible target of $4,900. Let’s embark on a comprehensive Ethereum price analysis to uncover the layers of this compelling market dynamic. Understanding the Current Ethereum Price Analysis Landscape Ethereum’s recent price action has been a testament to its resilience. Having recovered significantly to levels approaching its March 2024 peak, ETH demonstrates robust market demand. Yet, Glassnode’s recent insights, shared on X, highlight a critical on-chain metric: the level of unrealized profits . These refer to the gains investors would realize if they sold their ETH at the current market price, but have not yet done so. Glassnode’s observation reveals that, despite the strong price rebound, the overall unrealized profits held by the market are notably lower than what one might typically expect at these price points. This suggests a unique market condition, setting it apart from previous cycles where widespread unrealized gains often led to profit-taking. Here’s what Glassnode’s data implies: Strong Price Recovery: ETH has effectively rebounded, signaling renewed buyer confidence and market strength. Limited Unrealized Gains: A significant portion of ETH holders are not yet sitting on substantial paper profits, indicating less immediate incentive for widespread selling. Bullish Disparity: This gap between a strong price and low unrealized profits suggests reduced selling pressure, potentially paving the way for further upward movement. This dynamic creates a compelling foundation for future price movements, implying that the market has absorbed recent volatility without triggering a massive wave of profit-taking, thus preparing the ground for continued growth. Why Low Unrealized Profits Signal Upside Potential for ETH? The notion that low unrealized profits can be a bullish signal might seem counterintuitive, but it’s a core tenet of sophisticated Ethereum price analysis using on-chain data. The psychology behind this metric is crucial. When a large segment of the market holds significant unrealized gains, the temptation to sell and lock in those profits increases, creating potential downward pressure. Conversely, when unrealized profits are low, it suggests that: Recent Accumulation: Many investors may have acquired ETH at relatively higher prices recently, meaning they haven’t yet seen substantial returns. Strong Conviction: Existing holders might possess a strong long-term belief in Ethereum’s value, choosing to hold even through price fluctuations, anticipating higher targets. Reduced Supply Pressure: With fewer participants eager to sell, the market faces less immediate supply, allowing price appreciation to occur more freely if demand persists or grows. Glassnode’s findings suggest that the market is currently in a state where sellers are less inclined to offload their holdings, creating a ‘coiled spring’ effect. If buying pressure continues, there’s less resistance from profit-takers, which could accelerate price discovery. This underpins Glassnode’s projection of a possible $4,900 target, a level that would represent a new all-time high for Ethereum and likely ignite broader market enthusiasm. What Factors Influence Ethereum’s Price Trajectory Beyond On-Chain Metrics? While on-chain data provides invaluable insights for Ethereum price analysis , ETH’s trajectory is also profoundly shaped by broader ecosystem developments and macroeconomic forces. A holistic understanding requires looking beyond the immediate data points. Key catalysts driving Ethereum’s potential include: Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous improvement roadmap is a major factor. The recent Dencun upgrade significantly reduced transaction fees on Layer 2 networks, enhancing scalability and user experience. Future upgrades focused on efficiency and decentralization will further solidify its foundational role. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) & NFTs: Ethereum remains the leading platform for DeFi and a significant hub for NFTs. Continued innovation and growth in these sectors directly drive demand for ETH as gas and collateral. Institutional Adoption: Following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, anticipation for a potential spot Ethereum ETF is high. Approval could unlock substantial institutional capital, providing a significant boost to ETH’s price and market legitimacy. Global Macroeconomic Environment: Broader economic trends, interest rates, and geopolitical stability can influence investor risk appetite. As a risk asset, ETH’s performance is often intertwined with these larger financial narratives. These external factors, combined with the bullish on-chain signals from Glassnode, paint a comprehensive picture of Ethereum’s dynamic and evolving market position. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Your Ethereum Price Analysis Strategy The cryptocurrency market is famously volatile, and Ethereum is no exception. While Glassnode’s report offers a bullish perspective, it’s crucial for investors to adopt a disciplined approach. Effective Ethereum price analysis involves not just identifying potential gains but also robust risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Always combine insights from reputable sources like Glassnode with your own independent research into market trends, technical indicators, and Ethereum’s fundamentals. Understand Risk Tolerance: Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Define clear entry and exit strategies aligned with your personal financial goals. Implement Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Mitigate volatility by investing a fixed amount regularly, rather than a single lump sum. This averages out your purchase price over time. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid over-concentration in a single asset. Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can help manage risk. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto landscape changes rapidly. Keep abreast of network developments, regulatory news, and market sentiment, and be prepared to adjust your strategy accordingly. Prioritize Security: Protect your ETH holdings with strong, unique passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant amounts. By integrating these practices, you can better navigate market fluctuations and potentially capitalize on Ethereum’s growth trajectory. Challenges and Considerations for Ethereum’s Path Forward While the future for Ethereum appears bright, a balanced Ethereum price analysis must also acknowledge potential challenges and headwinds. Understanding these obstacles is key to informed decision-making. Key considerations include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Adverse regulations in major jurisdictions could impact adoption and market sentiment. Competition: Ethereum faces increasing competition from other Layer 1 blockchains offering alternative solutions for scalability and fees, challenging its market dominance. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic downturns, such as rising interest rates or recessions, can reduce investor risk appetite, potentially affecting crypto prices. Network Scalability: Despite ongoing upgrades, periods of extreme network demand can still lead to congestion and higher transaction fees on the mainnet, impacting user experience. Security Risks: Like any digital system, Ethereum is vulnerable to smart contract exploits, exchange hacks, or other security breaches, which could erode investor confidence. These challenges underscore the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto market, emphasizing the need for continuous vigilance. The latest Ethereum price analysis from Glassnode paints a compelling picture: ETH’s strong rebound, coupled with surprisingly low unrealized profits, suggests a robust foundation for significant further gains. This unique market dynamic, where widespread profit-taking is less likely, could pave the way for a push towards the $4,900 mark. While on-chain metrics provide powerful insights, it’s Ethereum’s relentless innovation, its thriving ecosystem, and growing institutional interest that truly underpin its long-term potential. As with any investment, prudence, continuous research, and a comprehensive understanding of both opportunities and risks are paramount. Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized future, and its journey ahead promises to be nothing short of captivating. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are ‘unrealized profits’ in the context of cryptocurrency? Unrealized profits represent the potential gains an investor has on their digital assets that have not yet been sold. It’s the difference between the current market price and the original purchase price. These profits are ‘unrealized’ because their value can fluctuate until the asset is actually sold. 2. Why is Glassnode’s analysis significant for Ethereum? Glassnode is a leading on-chain analytics firm that provides deep insights by analyzing blockchain data. Their analysis offers a unique perspective on market behavior, investor sentiment, and supply/demand dynamics directly from the blockchain, which is crucial for a nuanced understanding of Ethereum’s market health and potential future movements. 3. What is the significance of ETH nearing its March 2024 high? ETH nearing its March 2024 high of $3,980 signifies strong market resilience and renewed buyer confidence. It suggests that previous resistance levels are being retested, and a successful breakthrough could indicate a continuation of the upward trend, potentially leading to new all-time highs. 4. What factors could help Ethereum reach the $4,900 target? Several factors could contribute to Ethereum reaching $4,900, including sustained low unrealized profits reducing selling pressure, successful network upgrades like Dencun, increasing institutional adoption (e.g., potential spot ETH ETFs), continued growth in its DeFi and NFT ecosystems, and a generally bullish macroeconomic environment. 5. Is investing in Ethereum currently risky? Like all cryptocurrencies, investing in Ethereum carries inherent risks due to its high volatility, evolving regulatory landscape, and potential for unforeseen market events. While Glassnode’s analysis suggests upside potential, investors should always conduct thorough research, understand their risk tolerance, and consider diversification. 6. How can investors use Glassnode’s data in their strategy? Investors can leverage Glassnode’s data to gain deeper insights into market cycles, investor behavior, and underlying supply/demand dynamics. By monitoring metrics such as unrealized profits, on-chain flows, and accumulation trends, investors can make more informed decisions and refine their investment strategies.

2025-07-31 10:15:08,49295117,1753956908,"PowerBank and Intellistake Announce Strategic Alliance to Pioneer Digital Currencies, including Bitcoin Treasury Integration and RWA Tokenization","Highlights of the Partnership: Digital Currency Treasury Program: PowerBank will accumulate Bitcoin and Intellistake will accumulate digital currencies that support decentralized AI. . Bitcoin Treasury Management : Intellistake will help manage digital asset operations for PowerBank and serve as PowerBank’s supporting partner for security, custody, and treasury management. Tokenized Energy Assets : Potential for First-of-their-kind tokens backed by RWA including solar and storage infrastructure. VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA July 31, 2025 – POWERBANK CORPORATION (NASDAQ: SUUN; Cboe CA: SUNN, FSE: 103) (“ PowerBank ” or the “ Company “) – announces a transaction with Intellistake Technologies Corp. (“ Intellistake ”) that involves the intersection of digital assets, energy, and tokenized finance. Intellistake (CSE: ISTK) is a technology company bridging traditional capital markets with decentralized AI and blockchain infrastructure, and PowerBank (formerly SolarBank), is a leader in clean energy infrastructure. Together, these two high-growth companies will pursue three seminal initiatives : A Digital Asset Treasury Program: Leveraging Bitcoin as a long-term treasury reserve asset, PowerBank, with Intellistake’s support, intends to accumulate and hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet and Intellistake intends to accumulate digital assets that support decentralized AI, such as FET Token — aligning with the global shift toward decentralized financial reserves. Bitcoin Treasury Management: Under the partnership framework, Intellistake will help manage digital asset operations for PowerBank and serve as PowerBank’s supporting partner for security, custody, and treasury management of Bitcoin. The Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) : Intellistake and PowerBank are evaluating the potential tokenization of PowerBank’s clean energy assets or shares — providing an investment and financing alternative. “Tokenization is no longer a concept—it’s an inevitability,” said Jason Dussault, CEO of Intellistake . “By combining our expertise in capital markets and digital asset custody with PowerBank’s scalable, real-world energy platform, we’re unlocking a new opportunity..” As institutions and sovereign funds increasingly embrace tokenized securities and decentralized asset strategies, the Intellistake–PowerBank partnership centres on transforming legacy energy systems into a tokenized product. According to a recent report by CryptoSlate, analysts forecast that the market cap for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could reach $30 trillion by 2034(1)—driven by advances in blockchain, AI, and investor demand for transparent, real-time asset ownership and settlement. “This partnership is about more than collaboration—it’s about setting the pace for a shift in how companies manage capital and assets,” said Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank . “As the world accelerates toward AI, automation, and clean energy, Bitcoin and tokenization are presenting new opportunities. PowerBank and Intellistake are here to take part in that transformation, to bridge traditional energy infrastructure with the demand of the digital economy.” Intellistake and PowerBank are presently evaluating the regulatory framework for tokenization. Any tokenization will be subject to it being completed in compliance with applicable law, regulatory requirements and terms of any underlying agreements associated with PowerBank assets. The actual structure of such tokenization, the assets that would be subject to tokenization, and the associated timeline, have not yet been determined. Intellistake and PowerBank will provide further updates as material developments related to this tokenization strategy occur. The actual timing and value of Bitcoin purchases, under the allocation strategy will be determined by management. Purchases will also depend on several factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of Bitcoin and the anticipated cash needs of Intellistake or PowerBank. The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason. Intellistake will support PowerBank’s establishment of custody for its digital currency purchases and PowerBank no longer intends to utilize Coinbase for this service. As of the date of this press release, no Bitcoin purchases have been made.

2025-07-31 10:10:11,49293664,1753956611,Strategic Binance Withdrawal: A New Wallet’s $4.2M Crypto Move Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Binance Withdrawal: A New Wallet’s $4.2M Crypto Move Unveiled In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, significant movements of digital assets often capture the attention of investors and analysts alike. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a substantial Binance withdrawal , where a newly created wallet moved a staggering $4.2 million in various cryptocurrencies from the popular exchange. This isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver that provides valuable insights into market sentiment and the behavior of large holders. Understanding these on-chain movements is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of the digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Recent Strategic Binance Withdrawal The specific details of this notable Binance withdrawal were brought to light by Onchain Lens on X, a reputable source for on-chain analytics. The newly established wallet orchestrated a multi-asset transfer, meticulously moving significant portions of several prominent cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the components of this substantial transfer: 80,126 LINK: Valued at approximately $1.46 million, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, represents a key player in the decentralized oracle network space. Its inclusion suggests a belief in the long-term utility and adoption of oracle services. 110.34 Billion SHIB: Worth roughly $1.45 million, this massive amount of Shiba Inu (SHIB) highlights continued interest in meme coins, even among significant holders. It speaks to the speculative, yet often lucrative, nature of this segment of the market. 3.44 Million MATIC: Totaling about $762,000, Polygon’s MATIC token indicates an investment in scaling solutions for the Ethereum blockchain. This signals an understanding of the ongoing need for efficient and cost-effective transaction processing in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. 142.62 ETH: Valued at approximately $552,000, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ETH, remains a cornerstone of the crypto world. Its inclusion underscores confidence in the foundational blockchain that powers countless decentralized applications and innovations. These transactions, particularly when originating from a newly created wallet and moving away from an exchange, are widely interpreted as moves towards self-custody or long-term holding. This means the assets are likely being transferred to a personal wallet, often a hardware wallet (cold storage), where the owner has direct control over their private keys, rather than leaving them on an exchange. Why Do Large Crypto Withdrawals Matter? Decoding Wallet Behavior When a substantial amount of cryptocurrency is moved from an exchange like Binance to a private wallet, it’s not just a technicality; it’s a signal. These large-scale Binance withdrawal events can offer several insights into the intentions of the holder and, by extension, potentially influence market sentiment: 1. The Shift to Self-Custody: One of the primary reasons for such a move is to enhance security. Keeping assets on an exchange exposes them to risks like hacks, regulatory seizures, or exchange insolvency. Moving them to a personal, non-custodial wallet gives the owner complete control and significantly reduces these risks. This often indicates a long-term conviction in the assets’ value, as the holder is willing to take on the responsibility of managing their own private keys. 2. Accumulation Phase: Large withdrawals can signal that a ‘whale’ (a large holder) is accumulating assets, moving them off the market to hold for an extended period. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges and can be seen as a bullish indicator, suggesting that the holder believes the price will appreciate in the future. 3. Reduced Exchange Liquidity: While not immediately impactful for smaller withdrawals, a series of large withdrawals can slightly reduce the liquidity available on exchanges. This means there might be fewer assets readily available for trading, which could, in extreme cases, contribute to price volatility if demand surges. 4. Preparation for DeFi or Other Protocols: Sometimes, assets are withdrawn from exchanges not just for holding, but to be utilized in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking, or other on-chain activities that require direct wallet connection. This suggests active participation in the broader crypto ecosystem. Understanding the Assets: What Makes LINK, SHIB, MATIC, and ETH So Appealing? The choice of assets in this particular Binance withdrawal is telling. It reflects a diversified strategy that taps into different facets of the crypto market: Chainlink (LINK): As a decentralized oracle network, Chainlink provides real-world data to smart contracts, enabling them to execute based on external information. Its importance grows with the expansion of DeFi and Web3, making it a fundamental piece of the blockchain infrastructure. Investors often see LINK as a long-term play on the maturation of decentralized applications. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Starting as a meme coin, SHIB has evolved to include its own ecosystem, including a decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap) and efforts towards a Layer-2 solution (Shibarium). Its appeal often lies in its strong community, viral potential, and the possibility of rapid price appreciation, albeit with higher volatility. Polygon (MATIC): Polygon is a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aiming to address its scalability and high transaction fee issues. By offering faster and cheaper transactions, Polygon enhances the usability of Ethereum-based applications. MATIC’s inclusion suggests a belief in the continued growth of the Ethereum ecosystem and the necessity of scaling solutions. Ethereum (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized internet. Its transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge) and ongoing upgrades aim to make it more scalable, secure, and sustainable. ETH is often considered a core holding for crypto investors due to its foundational role in DeFi, NFTs, and numerous other decentralized applications. The combination of these assets suggests a balanced approach, blending established giants with promising scaling solutions and even high-potential meme coins, indicating a sophisticated understanding of the market’s diverse opportunities. The Crucial Role of On-Chain Analytics in Tracking a Binance Withdrawal In the transparent world of blockchain, every transaction leaves a trace. On-chain analytics platforms, like Onchain Lens, are indispensable tools for monitoring these movements. They provide the public with the ability to track large transfers, identify wallet addresses, and analyze transaction patterns. How On-Chain Analytics Work: Data Aggregation: These platforms constantly scan blockchain networks, collecting data on every transaction, including sender/receiver addresses, amounts, timestamps, and fees. Wallet Profiling: They often categorize wallets (e.g., exchange wallets, whale wallets, miner wallets) to provide context to transactions. Pattern Recognition: Advanced algorithms identify unusual patterns, large transfers, or significant accumulations/distributions that might signal market shifts. Insights Generation: The raw data is then transformed into digestible insights, charts, and alerts that help investors understand market dynamics beyond just price charts. For investors, monitoring these tools means gaining an edge. A large Binance withdrawal , when identified by an on-chain analyst, can prompt further investigation, helping one understand potential shifts in supply dynamics or long-term investor sentiment. Is This a Bullish or Bearish Sign for the Crypto Market? The interpretation of a large Binance withdrawal can vary, but generally, moving assets off an exchange is seen as a positive, or at least neutral, sign: Generally Bullish: When assets are withdrawn from exchanges, it typically means they are being moved to cold storage for long-term holding. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market, as these assets are no longer readily available for quick trades. It indicates strong conviction from the holder, suggesting they anticipate future price appreciation. Reduced Selling Pressure: Fewer coins on exchanges mean less potential supply available for immediate sale. If demand remains constant or increases, this supply crunch can lead to upward price pressure. Increased Decentralization: The move towards self-custody aligns with the core ethos of cryptocurrency – decentralization. It empowers individuals with full control over their assets, reducing reliance on centralized entities. While a withdrawal doesn’t guarantee a price surge, it certainly doesn’t carry the same negative connotations as a large deposit to an exchange, which often precedes selling activity. Actionable Insights for Navigating Significant Crypto Transfers For everyday investors, understanding these large-scale movements can provide valuable lessons and actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: While you don’t need to be an expert, following reputable on-chain analysts (like Onchain Lens) can provide early warnings or confirmations of significant trends. Tools like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, or even free blockchain explorers can offer basic insights. Consider Self-Custody: If you plan to hold your cryptocurrencies for the long term, learn about and implement self-custody solutions like hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor). This protects your assets from exchange-specific risks. Diversify Your Portfolio: As seen in this Binance withdrawal , even large holders diversify across different types of assets (utility tokens, meme coins, Layer-2s, foundational cryptocurrencies). This strategy helps mitigate risk and capture opportunities across various market segments. Don’t Panic Trade: A single large withdrawal or deposit shouldn’t be the sole basis for your trading decisions. Always combine on-chain data with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and broader market sentiment. Understand the ‘Why’: Instead of just noting a transaction, try to understand the potential motivations behind it. Is it a new wallet? An old whale waking up? A transfer to a DeFi protocol? The ‘why’ often provides more insight than the ‘what’. Challenges and Considerations in Crypto Self-Custody While the benefits of a Binance withdrawal to self-custody are clear, it’s essential to acknowledge the associated responsibilities and challenges: Responsibility of Private Keys: With self-custody comes the absolute responsibility of safeguarding your private keys or seed phrase. Losing them means losing access to your funds forever. There’s no ‘forgot password’ option. Security Risks: While less prone to exchange hacks, personal wallets can still be vulnerable to phishing attacks, malware, or physical theft if not properly secured. Education on best security practices is paramount. Complexity: For beginners, setting up and managing a hardware wallet can seem daunting. The learning curve is real, but necessary for secure long-term holding. Market Volatility: Even if held securely, the value of the assets remains subject to market fluctuations. A strategic withdrawal doesn’t guarantee price stability. These challenges underscore the importance of thorough research and a careful approach when deciding to move your assets off an exchange. Concluding Thoughts on This Significant Binance Withdrawal The recent $4.2 million Binance withdrawal by a newly created wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a microcosm of the evolving crypto landscape. It highlights the growing trend of investors prioritizing self-custody, demonstrating long-term conviction in specific digital assets, and leveraging sophisticated on-chain analytics to inform their strategies. Whether seen as a bullish signal for the market or simply a prudent security measure, such movements underscore the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency. As the ecosystem matures, tracking these strategic transfers will remain a vital practice for understanding market sentiment and making informed investment decisions. The power of transparency offered by blockchain technology continues to empower investors with unprecedented insights into the flow of digital wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does a large crypto withdrawal from an exchange typically signify? A large crypto withdrawal, especially from a newly created wallet, typically signifies a move towards self-custody for long-term holding. This reduces immediate selling pressure on exchanges and often indicates strong conviction from the holder in the assets’ future value. It’s generally viewed as a bullish or neutral signal. 2. Why would a newly created wallet make such a significant transfer? A newly created wallet might make a significant transfer for several reasons: to move assets into more secure cold storage (hardware wallets), to prepare funds for participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or as part of an accumulation strategy by a new large investor (whale) entering the market. 3. What are LINK, SHIB, MATIC, and ETH, and why are they significant? LINK (Chainlink) is crucial for connecting smart contracts to real-world data. SHIB (Shiba Inu) is a popular meme coin with a growing ecosystem. MATIC (Polygon) is a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enhancing transaction speed and cost-efficiency. ETH (Ethereum) is the foundational blockchain for countless decentralized applications. Their significance lies in their diverse roles, from infrastructure and scaling to speculative and community-driven projects, appealing to different investment theses. 4. How can investors track large crypto movements like this Binance withdrawal ? Investors can track large crypto movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers. Tools like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, CryptoQuant, Etherscan, or BscScan allow users to view transaction details, track wallet addresses, and identify significant transfers, providing transparency into market activities. 5. Is moving crypto to a personal wallet safer than keeping it on an exchange? Yes, moving crypto to a personal, non-custodial wallet (especially a hardware wallet) is generally considered safer for long-term holding than keeping it on an exchange. This is because you retain full control of your private keys, eliminating risks associated with exchange hacks, insolvency, or regulatory actions. However, it also places the full responsibility of security on you. 6. Does a large Binance withdrawal indicate a bullish or bearish market trend? A large Binance withdrawal is generally interpreted as a bullish or neutral sign. It suggests that the assets are being moved off the exchange for holding, reducing the immediate supply available for sale and indicating long-term conviction by the holder. This contrasts with large deposits to exchanges, which often precede selling activity and can be seen as bearish. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-31 10:08:45,49293579,1753956525,"Five ancient miner wallets reawakened, consolidating their 50 BTC","Ancient wallets keep moving their coins, as BTC easily trades near its all-time high. Five notable miner wallets from 2010 moved 250 BTC in the past day. BTC from 2010 moved from miner wallets, showing not all inactive holders lead to lost coins. A total of five early wallets moved 250 Bitcoin, becoming a part of the trend for old coins to be shifted around or sold. The five miner wallets probably belonged to the same individual, as they were consolidated in two new addresses. One of the new wallets contained over $11M, while the other wallet held 150 BTC valued at over $17.7M. The coins were mined when market prices were under $0.10. All the block rewards were received on the same day, during the time when Satoshi Nakamoto was also producing blocks. The miner moved the coins as Bitcoin recovered above $118,000, with still robust spot demand. Whales have proven to be long-term holders, but also ready to take profits at the market peak. Previously, miners were awakened from dormancy during the late 2024 market rally, with one ancient whale sending 50 BTC directly to Binance. Bitcoin moves from untouched block rewards The Bitcoin moved all came from untouched block rewards of 50 coins, received on April 2010. The wallets come from the Satoshi era, mined at a much lower difficulty and minimal electricity expenses. 5 miner wallets woke up after being dormant for over 15 years and transferred 250 $BTC ($29.6M) out an hour ago. These miner wallets earned 50 $BTC each from mining on Apr 26, 2010. Wallets: 1NuqAKeX6JzW372QfEe7eFkewFx21fnqd3 12EWRT19v2eAvWjGDWjodCe7NP1CzmFphT… pic.twitter.com/vGttaE6MxY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 31, 2025 As with other addresses from before 2011, the wallets in question were dusted with an op_return transaction, issuing a pseudo-legal claim on the coins. While the attack is unable to really establish ownership over the coins, the transactions seem to have become a trigger for securing the ancient coins into new addresses. The recent miner selling arrived just a day after another ancient investor moved 3,963 BTC . The relatively small amounts of coins are not able to affect the market, which recently absorbed sales of 80K BTC without crashing the price. However, old miner coins with no history may be valuable to treasuries. Small-scale treasury buyers can join the top 100 of corporate holders with as low as 29 Bitcoin, meaning even a few older BTC can help create the basis for reserves with provable origin. Miner reserves turn lower on profit-taking Prominent mining companies often retain their coins, forming an organic treasury. Big-scale entities like Mara Holdings have expanded their wallets above 50,000 BTC. Overall, miners decreased their reserves from 1.9M Bitcoin down to 1.8M, based on Cryptoquant data . Despite this, hashrate remains high, barring seasonal fluctuations due to low hydroelectric power resources. Based on the hash ribbon indicator, miners are producing blocks very close to distress conditions. This time, there is no clear miner capitulation, but some are taking profits to make use of the low production price of their older BTC. The selling may also be a part of the pivot to AI data centers, which some of the biggest mining companies have taken up. The Bitcoin hashrate is back above 915 EH/s, with difficulty near its all-time high. Mining remains extremely competitive, though companies are still ready to build mining facilities for their own use, or to lend hashrate.

2025-07-31 10:06:40,49295182,1753956400,ResearchCoin price: here’s why Brian Armstrong-backed token jumped 100%,"ResearchCoin (RSC), a cryptocurrency token tied to the ResearchHub platform and backed by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, is surging as altcoins eye upside momentum. The RSC coin rose more than 100% in 24 hours, jumping from lows of $0.39 to $0.85 as buying pressure ramped up on July 30 and early July 31, 2025. ResearchCoin spikes 100% after Coinbase listing news While Research Coin (RSC)’s price aligned with gains for top altcoins like Ethereum , Solana and XRP, the ResearchCoin token witnessed fresh upside pressure amid a wave of significant announcements from major exchanges. One of the biggest catalysts for ResearchCoin’s dramatic price increase appears to be the recent announcement from Coinbase. After the US-based cryptocurrency exchange added RSC on its listing roadmap last week, it announced on July 30, 2025, that it would be listing ResearchCoin on the Base network. Coinbase plans to have RSC trading go live on or after 9 AM PT on July 31, 2025, subject to liquidity conditions. Coinbase Assets 🛡️ @CoinbaseAssets · Follow Coinbase will add support for ResearchCoin (RSC) on the Base network. Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on @Coinbase @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. 9:58 pm · 30 Jul 2025 261 Reply Copy link Read 49 replies This news triggered an immediate market reaction, with RSC’s price soaring more than 100% as it jumped to an intraday high of $0.85. RSC price also jumped more than 80% when Coinbase added RSC to its asset roadmap. RSC currently trades around $0.76, up 12% in the past 24 hours and 104% in the past week. The altcoin reached its all-time high of $1.51 in January 2025. Why else could RSC be bullish? Other exchanges have also added support for RSC, with this move not only validating the token’s potential but also setting out to boost its visibility across the market. Coinbase’s vast user base and prominence as a top exchange make RSC one of the small-cap tokens to watch. However, the likely bullish catalysts go beyond the Coinbase listing. At the heart of RSC’s appeal is its mission to revolutionise scientific research, as articulated by Brian Armstrong. Brian Armstrong @brian_armstrong · Follow Coinbase added $RSC today to its listings roadmap. Since I’m a co-founder of @ResearchHub , I want to share a few details about the precautions put in place years ago to remove any conflicts of interest:– All assets that get listed on Coinbase go through our Digital Asset 9:39 pm · 25 Jul 2025 1.1K Reply Copy link Read 195 replies In a statement shared via X, Armstrong said: “The mission of ResearchHub is to accelerate scientific research. My hope is that ResearchHub and ResearchCoin will be good for the world in terms of helping accelerate scientific research, and that I can help set it up for long term success.” The combination of Armstrong’s influential backing, ResearchHub’s clear use case in scientific advancement, and growing market traction could be key to RSC price gains. Additionally, market data from CryptoQuant highlights a scenario where the market still sees a 2025 altseason.

2025-07-31 10:05:26,49293484,1753956326,Ripple CTO Warns XRP Holders to Avoid This Scammer,"A new impersonation attempt targeting XRP holders has surfaced on X, using a fake video of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The clip falsely claims that Ripple is launching a massive XRP giveaway following its lawsuit resolution with the SEC. The video shows Garlinghouse seated in what appears to be a corporate office setting, speaking directly to the camera about XRP’s future and announcing a 100 million XRP giveaway. It was posted by a verified account to target XRP community members, but Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, quickly responded, flagging it as fraudulent. pic.twitter.com/fL6rDF7Pv9 — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 30, 2025 Deepfake Video Targets XRP Community The clip appears to be a deepfake, a type of AI-generated content that mimics public figures using realistic visuals and voice synthesis. The tactic has been increasingly used in financial scams to gain the trust of unsuspecting viewers. What makes the timing of this scam notable is its connection to recent developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, Ripple announced that it would drop its appeal against the SEC , with the CEO stating that the company was closing that chapter. The SEC is expected to take a similar approach, effectively ending the dispute that began in 2020. The scammer behind the deepfake is exploiting this news, using it to lend credibility to the giveaway hoax. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Avoiding Scammers in the Crypto Space Garlinghouse recently warned the community about similar scams on YouTube, where scammers impersonate Ripple’s official account to attack the community. According to the CEO, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. He noted that XRP’s success and market rallies have drawn out these scammers. However, the company constantly stays ahead of them, keeping the community updated on these scam tactics and ensuring everyone stays safe and secures their investments. The impersonation tactics used in this case align with broader trends in cryptocurrency-related fraud. Attackers often exploit trending topics, verified accounts, or legitimate user replies to increase the visibility of fake promotions. In some cases, they encourage victims to send tokens to an address with the promise of multiplied returns, only for those funds to be lost permanently. Schwartz is also known for regularly calling out impersonators and scams on X and has a consistent history of exposing these schemes. His response in this instance was clear and direct, and Ripple and its executives have consistently reiterated that they will never ask the community for XRP .

The JAM upgrade removes fees and adds parallel chains, drawing more developers to Polkadot. With the price near key levels, the volume surge hints at a shift against larger assets like Ethereum. ETF Approval Creates New Access for Investors Polkadot has moved into focus following recent changes in ETF listing standards. The US Securities and Exchange Commission currently allows ETFs on assets with more than six months of regulated futures trading. This requirement is met by DOT, which has been trading on Coinbase futures since July 2024. Consequently, Grayscale and 21Shares are among the asset managers that are developing exchange-traded products backed by DOT. Launching may commence in September or October of 2025. These products may bring Polkadot to a broader market, offering exposure through regulated investment channels. DOT ETF IS COMING!

The chart shared by crypto analyst Friedrich marks resistance levels between $16 and $60, based on past market activity. These price zones saw strong movement in earlier cycles.

The new design uses multiple smaller chains running at the same time. This setup removes gas fees and is built to improve transaction speed. The upgrade involves 38 development teams and is supported by dedicated funding. It is expected to begin before the end of 2025. Activity around JAM has brought more developer attention and shifted focus back to Polkadot’s roadmap. DOT Price Update and Market History At the time of writing, DOT was priced at $3.90. It recorded a slight gain over the last 24 hours but is down nearly 1% over the past week. The highest price reached was $54.98 in November 2021, while the lowest was $2.70 in August 2020. Source: Coingecko Volume over the past 24 hours reached $340 million. With the price trading near a key level from earlier market cycles and volume showing signs of growth, traders are monitoring the pair closely.

2025-07-31 10:02:18,49303943,1753956138,"Here’s What Could Happen to XRP Price If 200,000 Bitcoin are Converted to XRP in Single Trade","The XRP price could witness a dramatic surge overnight if a single trade converted 200,000 Bitcoin tokens for XRP. Growing Comparisons Around XRP and BitcoinLately, conversations comparing XRP and Bitcoin have grown louder within crypto circles. Earlier this month, analyst Amonyx predicted that XRP would create more millionaires than Bitcoin ever did. Also, on July 10, while XRP traded near $2.40 and Bitcoin hovered around $115,000, crypto founder Edoardo Farina advised BTC holders to divest into XRP, calling it their final chance to benefit from what he believes is an upcoming rally.Amid these discussions, we decided to explore an idea: What if someone converted 200,000 BTC into XRP in a single trade? To assess the potential impact, we turned to two top AI chatbots, Grok from xAI and Gemini from Google. While Grok estimated a rise in XRP price to around $12, Gemini suggested it could reach a more modest $6 to $8.To put things into perspective, XRP now trades at $3.14, with a market cap of $186.6 billion and a circulating supply of 59.23 billion tokens. Its 24-hour trading volume stands at $6.4 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin changes hands at $118,837 with a $2.364 trillion market cap and 19.89 million tokens in circulation. Its daily volume has surged to a massive $71.7 billion at press time.Grok Evaluates XRP Price if a Trade Converted 200,000 Bitcoin to XRPIn its response , Grok first calculated the value of the trade in question. At current prices, 200,000 BTC amounts to about $23.77 billion. Notably, if a buyer used that to purchase XRP at $3.14, they would acquire around 7.57 billion XRP, which makes up roughly 12.78% of XRP's circulating supply. In contrast, the BTC being sold represents just over 1% of Bitcoin's supply. Grok noted that while Bitcoin could absorb such a trade with relatively less disruption, XRP would face a greater impact since the trade size outweighs its daily volume by more than threefold.To estimate how prices might react, Grok presented several market impact models. In a basic linear model, Bitcoin would drop by about 16.57%, bringing the price down to $99,151. However, the AI chatbot pointed out that real markets don't react that smoothly. It then switched to a logarithmic model, which better reflects large trades in deep markets, and projected a sharper 28.6% drop, with Bitcoin sliding to around $84,849 .For XRP, the initial linear model projected a price jump of over 550%, which would lift the token to $20.63. However, Grok adjusted this with a square-root impact model to account for diminishing price returns as the trade progresses. This approach placed XRP's post-trade price closer to $12.22, a rise of about 289%. XRP and Bitcoin Price Assessments Grok XRP and Bitcoin Price Assessments | Grok Grok also updated the market caps. Specifically, after the trade, Bitcoin's lower price would push its market cap down to roughly $1.667 trillion. On the other hand, the flood of capital into XRP would boost its market cap to around $820.8 billion.Gemini Assesses XRP Price if a Trade Converted 200,000 Bitcoin to XRPMeanwhile, Gemini used a different method. It focused on slippage, which refers to the price change that occurs as a trade pushes through buy or sell orders. According to Gemini, the massive BTC sale would trigger about 30% slippage, meaning most BTC would sell at around $83,186. This drop could spark panic selling, force liquidations, and send Bitcoin as low as $70,000 before it settles.Conversely, Gemini estimated that the XRP buy would double the average execution price to around $6.28. At that rate, the buyer would get about 3.78 billion XRP.While simple calculations based on added value suggest XRP could reach $3.55, Gemini argued that real market behavior like FOMO and a thinning order book would likely drive the price higher, possibly to between $6 and $10 .

Priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong momentum among investors who are now actively looking beyond traditional blue-chip cryptocurrencies. What makes this protocol stand out isn’t price alone—it’s the well-structured, utility-driven ecosystem that backs the MUTM token with real DeFi mechanics and tangible value generation. Bitcoin (BTC) Flatlines for a Third Straight Day Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stagnant near $119,000 for three consecutive days, trading at ~$118,421 with a 0.39% 24-hour decline, as per CoinMarketCap data. Despite record ETF inflows exceeding $55 billion, including $157.02 million recently, BTC struggles to break the $120,000 resistance, with support at $116,000. On-chain data shows 40,000 BTC ($4.7B) flowed to exchanges recently, signaling profit-taking, while miners’ revenue pressures (MPI at 2.78) add headwinds. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart suggests a potential breakout, but low 7-day volatility (1.34%) indicates indecision. Institutional demand, driven by BlackRock’s IBIT ($20B+), remains robust, yet macro uncertainty from U.S.-China trade talks and a neutral Altcoin Season Index (51) dampen momentum. A break above $119,500 could target $122,000, but failure may see a dip to $112,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Building During Bitcoin’s Pause Bitcoin’s stability in the short term might signal uncertainty, but while large-cap assets consolidate, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building from the ground up. The platform is not just a simple lending protocol—it represents a shift toward decentralized finance infrastructure that combines borrowing, lending, passive earnings, and native stablecoin integration within one framework. This makes it an ecosystem, not just a token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique Pooled-to-Contract (P2C) lending model enables users to deposit assets such as USDT, DAI, ETH, or BTC and receive mtTokens, which serve as interest-bearing tokens representing their share in the lending pool. These mtTokens automatically increase in value based on real-time pool utilization. Users can then stake these mtTokens in dedicated smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards—rewards that are consistently bought back from the open market using the platform’s revenue. This closed-loop reward system avoids inflation and aligns the interests of both protocol users and token holders. Meanwhile, the borrowing side offers overcollateralized loans using stable or blue-chip assets. For example, a borrower depositing $10,000 in ETH at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio would receive $6,000 in liquidity—without having to sell their ETH. This model enables users to retain their asset exposure while accessing capital, a key incentive during sideways or bullish markets. Lenders, in turn, benefit from competitive APYs reaching 10–12%, especially during high utilization periods. For those seeking higher risk-reward strategies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This secondary model allows lenders to negotiate terms directly with borrowers—especially useful for newer or riskier memecoins like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP. While it’s not the protocol’s core feature, it adds optionality for experienced users and demonstrates how the ecosystem is engineered for diverse DeFi participants. Security-conscious investors will also take note of the project’s CertiK audit, boasting a Token Security Score of 95 and Skynet rating of 78—demonstrating transparency and a commitment to protocol integrity. Moreover, the team is actively encouraging public participation with a $50,000 bug bounty program, while marketing efforts are being reinforced through a $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The Numbers That Matter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.035. So far, the project has already raised $13.8 million, with 14,700+ unique holders participating in the early rounds. As demand continues to build, the token price is set to increase by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This rapid accumulation signals growing confidence in the platform, especially from users who are looking for strong upside potential rather than waiting for another BTC rally. The total token supply is 4 billion MUTM, and at a planned listing price of $0.06, those who got in at Phase 1 ($0.01) would be looking at 6x returns, while even current Phase 6 buyers at $0.035 could be eyeing a solid 70% upside before listing. However, internal projections are significantly more ambitious. Analysts covering this presale have floated future price targets as high as $1.50, which would imply over 42x growth from the current entry point. Add to this a growing social base, with 12,000+ Twitter followers and rising engagement from the DeFi community, and it becomes clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a solid foundation before its launch. The platform is also integrating a Layer-2 solution, ensuring scalability and lower transaction costs—two major pain points in legacy DeFi protocols. While meme coins and speculative tokens dominate headlines, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represent the evolution of smart money. It’s not about the noise—it’s about the structure, utility, and reward logic that gives real-world function to crypto investment. With mtTokens unlocking yield and the MUTM ecosystem rewarding users via staking and revenue-driven buybacks, this is a project actively constructing long-term value—not just marketing hype. As Bitcoin flatlines, the smart capital is already rotating. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced to move, structured to last, and positioned for exponential growth.

2025-07-31 10:00:06,49293203,1753956006,Robinhood Revenue Nearly Doubles in Q2 as Tokenization Plans Take Center Stage,"Trading platform Robinhood reported a 98% year-on-year surge in its crypto revenue, reaching $160 million in the second quarter of 2025, as the company ramps up its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization both in the United States and globally. Alongside this, the company’s total net revenue climbed to $989 million, marking a 45% increase, while net income jumped 105% to $386 million. Despite outperforming Wall Street expectations, shares of Robinhood dipped slightly in after-hours trading. The boost in revenue coincided with a 32% rise in crypto trading volumes to $28 billion, in line with a broader market rally that lifted the total crypto market cap by 21.7% to $3.36 trillion. CEO Vlad Tenev used the earnings call to emphasize the firm’s long-term strategy to lead in asset tokenization, following the launch of Robinhood Chain — a layer 2 blockchain designed for stock trading in Europe. Targeting Private Markets Through Tokenization Tenev described tokenization as the most transformative innovation in financial services over the last decade. “Private markets and related real-world assets are opportunities that don’t exist up until now,” he said. Robinhood aims to make traditionally illiquid and inaccessible assets like private equity, venture capital funds, and real estate available to retail investors via tokenization. The company’s recent $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp is expected to serve as a cornerstone for executing this tokenization strategy. Robinhood has already begun issuing private equity tokens in Europe that simulate the shares of high-profile firms such as SpaceX and OpenAI. Interest from developers has grown rapidly since the strategy was unveiled at a high-profile event in Cannes. “We’ve just got lots and lots of calls from developers that either want to tokenize the shares of their own companies or otherwise jump on the tokenization of real-world assets revolution,” Tenev noted. Robinhood Faces Legal Hurdles and Market Competition However, the platform’s early tokenization efforts have not gone unnoticed by regulators. A legal inquiry has been opened in Lithuania regarding Robinhood’s RWA tokens , while OpenAI clarified that Robinhood’s token representing its equity does not constitute a real stake in the company. Still, Tenev believes Robinhood is well-positioned to scale the initiative. With over 25 million users and $1 trillion in assets under custody, he argues that no blockchain-native firm has the same reach or infrastructure to pursue retail-facing tokenized assets at this scale. While Ethereum leads the RWA market with nearly $7 billion in tokenized assets, the company’s strategy suggests it is betting big on bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto infrastructure.

2025-07-31 10:00:05,49293169,1753956005,Dogecoin Just Flashed A Rare Weekly Bullish Signal — This Analyst Is Buying,"A closely watched chartist on X, Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow), says he added to his Dogecoin exposure after a key Ichimoku signal appeared on the weekly chart. Posting at 2:46 p.m. on July 30, 2025, he shared a TradingView snapshot and wrote: “DOGE weekly — Ichimoku cloud — Bullish Tenkan–Kijun cross — Finding support at the Tenkan (blue line).” He followed with a straightforward disclosure: “I bought a little bit more $DOGE here.” This Dogecoin Ichimoku Signal Can’t Be Ignored The chart he published was captured at 12:46 UTC on July 30 and showed Dogecoin (weekly timeframe) trading near $0.216 after a week-to-date decline of 10.23%. TradingView’s readout on the image lists weekly O/H/L/C at 0.24076 / 0.24854 / 0.21440 / 0.21613, alongside Ichimoku values Tenkan-sen 0.21517, Kijun-sen 0.21142, Senkou Span A 0.21329, and Senkou Span B 0.28247. The thrust of the analyst’s call rests on classic Ichimoku mechanics. The Tenkan-sen (conversion line) has crossed above the Kijun-sen (base line) on the weekly chart—an event technicians describe as a bullish Tenkan–Kijun cross. In the posted image, spot price sits marginally above the Tenkan and Kijun, consistent with his comment that price is “finding support at the Tenkan.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Unlock To Put $22.9M Worth Of Tokens Into Circulation In Ichimoku methodology, the Tenkan often acts as a fast-moving gauge of momentum and, when rising above the slower Kijun, can mark the start of a momentum-led trend attempt. On higher timeframes such as the weekly, participants typically treat those inflections as more consequential than on intraday charts. That said, the same screenshot shows DOGE trading beneath the weekly cloud (Kumo) projected ahead, with Senkou Span B up near the $0.28 area. In textbook terms, signals that occur below the cloud are generally categorized as weaker than signals that occur above it, even when the Tenkan–Kijun cross is bullish. The image also captures the context of the move: after a forceful green candle in mid-July, two red weekly candles followed, leaving price clustered around the Tenkan/Kijun zone. Related Reading: Is $1 Dogecoin ‚Inevitable‘? Analyst Cites Perfect Storm Of Factors Pressed for a status check a day later, the analyst reiterated that the technical picture had not broken down: “DOGE holding weekly Ichimoku Tenkan and Kijun support so far,” he wrote on July 31. That comment underscores how Ichimoku practitioners often judge trend health by whether price can close above the Kijun on the chosen timeframe and continue to respect the Tenkan on pullbacks. For now, the story is a straightforward one: a bullish Tenkan–Kijun cross on the weekly chart, with price attempting to base at those lines while the cloud overhead still looms as longer-term resistance. As ever with Ichimoku analysis, the coming weekly close relative to the Tenkan and Kijun will be the focal reference for traders tracking whether this early signal can mature into a broader uptrend.

Details Here…,"After Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were approved in the US, the ETF process has begun for many altcoins such as XRP and Solana (SOL). While the SEC has not yet approved any altcoin ETFs other than Ethereum, two major US exchanges have applied to the SEC for simplified regulations for crypto ETF listings. Accordingly, the securities exchange Cboe BZX Exchange, along with NYSE Arca, filed a rule change with the SEC to ensure faster processing of cryptocurrency ETF listings, requesting changes for ETFs to speed up the transaction process. Exchanges have proposed allowing ETF issuers to list their products under a single framework, without having to apply for approval separately for each new cryptocurrency ETF. If approved, this could eliminate the need for separate approvals for each new fund and simplify the approval process. Experts said the proposal from Cboe and NYSE would eliminate the existing review process for exchange rule change applications for ETFs (19b-4) and allow ETFs that meet certain requirements to be automatically listed and traded without additional approval procedures. Under current regulations, exchanges must file Form 19b-4 for each new crypto ETF offering, leading to a lengthy and complex review process of up to 240 days. However, the proposed new framework could shorten this timeframe and simplify the process. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, said: “Cboe has filed a 19b-4 requesting a rule change that would allow crypto ETFs to be listed and traded under a standard framework. In other words, issuers would not need to seek special approval for each crypto ETF, as long as it meets certain criteria.” *This is not investment advice.

The asset is currently moving toward the upper bands of its two-week range-bound channel and could break out soon. “I think I’m wrong about ETH getting some short-term downside,” crypto analyst ‘Byzantine General’ told his 236,000 X followers on Wednesday. “It’s too strong and refuses to print any significant correction,” they added, noting that derivatives funding rates were going negative. Funding rates are periodic payments between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the underlying asset’s spot price. When funding rates go below baseline, it usually indicates bearish market sentiment as more traders are short than long, creating an imbalance, but this doesn’t seem to be happening with ETH.

Now that the big dump has happened, ETH should break $4,000 this time around, he said. Cowen has predicted that the asset will trade in a realistic range of $5,700 to $7,500 for new all-time highs this cycle. Meanwhile, ‘Crypto GEMs’ predicted that ETH would reach $5,000 by the end of August. This month of the bull market year (the one after the Bitcoin halving) has been historically good for Ether.

The Ethereum community celebrated Ethereum’s 10th anniversary by ringing the closing bell at NASDAQ on Wednesday. “We worked to seed a new ecosystem and onboard TradFi to DeFi, with a mission to rebuild the global financial system.

Atkins endorsed the PWG’s crypto policy proposals, describing them as the product of sustained inter-agency efforts and a critical step toward regulatory clarity. He emphasized that their efforts align with President Trump’s goal to make the United States the center of the global crypto economy . SEC’s Atkins says the PWG report will drive innovation and protect investors According to Atkins, the PWG report provides a balanced framework for digital asset oversight that encourages innovation, protects investors, and maintains the world-class standing of America’s financial markets. He explained that the framework would preserve market stability, encourage secure adoption, and enhance investor safeguards. He added that the SEC will continue to exercise its existing authority to create new rules and enforce any legislation passed by Congress. Atkins also acknowledged President Trump for his proactive stance on crypto, which was something he had seen was missing in the past administration. He commented, “Thank goodness President Trump does and is leading on it.” He also supported his colleagues, saying he would work with Commissioner Hester Peirce and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force to foster the crypto vision. The PWG report urges closer coordination between the SEC, CFTC, and other key federal agencies to establish a unified, transparent, and consistent regulatory approach. In line with the report’s recommendations, Atkins stated that they will develop innovative and durable regulatory policies that encourage growth in the sector and address potential risks. He noted that the US still needs to step up its efforts to stay ahead in the crypto revolution, saying he’s ready to do his part of the work. The Trump administration had asked regulators to act on the report’s recommendations On Wednesday, the Trump administration urged federal regulators to implement the report’s recommendations. In a fact sheet, the White House commented on the PWG report, saying, “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto.” It added that the report calls for the SEC and CFTC to act within their authority to facilitate federal-level trading of digital assets by setting clear rules on registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping. Additionally, per the fact sheet, the report requires regulators to ensure that new financial products can reach the market swiftly, without being held up by red tape. The report also pushes that the agencies clarify which bank functions are allowed in terms of stablecoins and blockchain technology, and for them to enhance disclosure around the process for obtaining bank charters. These recommendations come on the heels of President Trump signing the first-ever congressional legislation regulating stablecoins , a move hailed as a major victory for the crypto sector. The law outlines a framework for US dollar-backed stablecoins, which proponents say will encourage broader adoption of digital assets in mainstream finance, despite controversial views. Some lawmakers criticized the stablecoin framework, believing the president still has conflicts of interest. Trump and his family have affiliations with digital asset businesses, such as World Liberty Financial, a platform that has launched its token and stablecoin. Get seen where it counts.

2025-07-31 09:40:10,49292360,1753954810,Crucial Update: Binance RUNE Suspension for Essential THORChain Network Upgrade,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Update: Binance RUNE Suspension for Essential THORChain Network Upgrade In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about exchange announcements is crucial for every investor and trader. A significant development has just emerged concerning THORChain (RUNE) holders on Binance. The global crypto exchange giant, Binance, has announced a temporary Binance RUNE suspension of deposits and withdrawals for the THORChain network. This move, scheduled for July 31st, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, is in direct support of an upcoming, vital upgrade to the THORChain network. Understanding the implications of this suspension and what steps to take is paramount for ensuring your assets remain secure and accessible. Understanding the Binance RUNE Suspension : What’s Happening? Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently issued an official notice detailing its plans to halt all RUNE transactions on its platform. This isn’t an arbitrary decision but a standard procedure undertaken by exchanges to ensure the smooth and secure transition during significant blockchain network upgrades. The temporary Binance RUNE suspension specifically targets deposits and withdrawals of the THORChain network’s native token, RUNE. The announcement specifies that the suspension will commence precisely on July 31, 2024, at 17:00 UTC . While the exact duration of the suspension has not been explicitly stated beyond the commencement time, such halts typically last until the network upgrade is successfully completed and the network’s stability is verified. Users are advised to closely monitor Binance’s official announcements for updates regarding the resumption of services. Why do exchanges implement such measures? There are several key reasons: Data Integrity: To prevent any potential loss or corruption of user funds during the upgrade process, which often involves significant changes to the blockchain’s underlying architecture. Smooth Transition: To ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded on the new, upgraded chain, avoiding discrepancies or forks that could lead to confusion or financial losses. Security: Upgrades can sometimes expose temporary vulnerabilities. Suspending services minimizes the risk of exploitation during these critical periods. Compliance: Ensuring the exchange’s systems are fully compatible with the upgraded network’s protocols. This proactive step by Binance underscores its commitment to user security and the overall health of the THORChain ecosystem. It’s a testament to responsible exchange management, prioritizing the long-term stability of the assets it supports. What is THORChain (RUNE) and Why is This Upgrade Important? For those new to the space, THORChain (RUNE) stands as a groundbreaking decentralized liquidity protocol that enables seamless, non-custodial cross-chain swaps. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, THORChain allows users to exchange native cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and RUNE itself) directly between different blockchains without wrapping or bridging assets. This functionality is powered by its native utility token, RUNE, which is used for security, governance, and as a settlement asset within the network. Network upgrades are the lifeblood of any evolving blockchain project. They are essential for introducing new features, improving scalability, enhancing security, and fixing bugs. For THORChain, an upgrade can mean: Increased Efficiency: Faster transaction processing times and lower fees. Enhanced Security: Strengthening the network’s resilience against potential attacks. New Capabilities: Introduction of innovative functionalities that expand THORChain’s utility and appeal. Scalability Improvements: Preparing the network to handle a larger volume of transactions and users. While specific details of this particular THORChain upgrade have not been fully disclosed by Binance in their suspension notice, the very act of an exchange halting services for it signifies its importance. Such upgrades are critical for the long-term viability and competitiveness of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like THORChain. For RUNE holders, a successful upgrade typically translates to a more robust, secure, and valuable network, potentially leading to increased adoption and utility for their assets. Actionable Insights for RUNE Holders: What Should You Do Amidst the Binance RUNE Suspension ? If you hold RUNE on Binance or plan to interact with the THORChain network, this announcement requires your immediate attention. Here are some actionable steps and considerations: Avoid Transactions: Absolutely refrain from initiating any RUNE deposits or withdrawals on Binance from July 31, 2024, 17:00 UTC, until Binance officially announces the resumption of these services. Any attempts during this period may result in the loss of your funds or significant delays. Monitor Official Channels: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements page, their blog, and their social media channels for updates. This is the most reliable source of information regarding the status of the Binance RUNE suspension and the resumption of services. Plan Ahead: If you need to move your RUNE before the suspension, ensure you complete your transactions well in advance of the deadline. Consider the time zones carefully to avoid last-minute rushes. No Impact on Holdings: Your RUNE holdings on Binance will remain safe and unaffected during the suspension. This halt only pertains to the ability to move RUNE in or out of the exchange, not the security or value of your existing balance. Consider Alternatives (If Urgent): If you have an urgent need to interact with RUNE during the suspension period, you might explore other exchanges that support RUNE and have not announced a similar suspension, or consider self-custody solutions if you’re comfortable managing your own private keys. However, always exercise extreme caution and verify the legitimacy of any platform. Being proactive and informed is your best defense against potential issues during network upgrades. The temporary inconvenience of a Binance RUNE suspension is a small price to pay for the long-term health and security of the THORChain network. Navigating Future Crypto Exchange Updates: Best Practices The Binance RUNE suspension serves as a valuable reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Network upgrades, scheduled maintenance, and various other operational adjustments are common occurrences in this space. Developing a routine for staying informed can save you from unexpected surprises and potential losses. Here are some best practices for navigating future crypto exchange updates: Subscribe to Exchange Alerts: Most major exchanges offer email newsletters or notification services for important announcements. Sign up for these. Follow Official Social Media: Follow your preferred exchanges and the projects you invest in on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, or Discord. Be wary of unofficial accounts and always verify information. Regularly Check Announcement Pages: Make it a habit to periodically visit the official announcement sections of the exchanges you use. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just note the ‘what’ of an announcement; try to understand the ‘why’. Knowing the reason behind a suspension or upgrade helps you assess its impact and importance. Diversify (Where Prudent): While not always feasible for every asset, having funds spread across different secure platforms can sometimes offer flexibility during specific exchange-related events. By adopting these habits, you empower yourself to react swiftly and appropriately to any changes, ensuring your crypto journey remains as smooth and secure as possible. In conclusion, the temporary Binance RUNE suspension for deposits and withdrawals, effective July 31, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, is a necessary measure in support of an upcoming THORChain network upgrade. While it requires users to adjust their transaction plans, it is ultimately a positive sign of a healthy, evolving blockchain ecosystem and a responsible exchange. By staying informed, planning ahead, and understanding the reasons behind such actions, RUNE holders can navigate this period with confidence, looking forward to a stronger and more efficient THORChain network post-upgrade.

2025-07-31 09:37:48,49295179,1753954668,Bitcoin may end consolidation phase and break above $120k,"The cryptocurrency market has been consolidating over the last few days, but could experience a breakout soon. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has been trading between the $115k-$120k region over the last two weeks. However, BTC could be gearing up for a breakout that would allow it to hit a new all-time high soon. BTC recovers above $118k as Fed keeps rate unchanged Bitcoin has had a volatile 24 hours following the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the apex bank is keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged . The decision marks a continuation of the Fed’s “wait-and-see” strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of tariffs on inflation. However, the major impact on Bitcoin’s price was Powell’s speech. The Fed chair stated that there are several economic releases before the September FOMC meeting, including two months of data on employment and inflation. Hence, there is no certainty of a rate cut in September. He added that, “We’ll be taking that information into consideration and all the other information we get as we make our decision at the September meeting. If the risks to the two mandates were more in balance, that would imply that policy shouldn’t be restrictive – hence the bar for a rate cut is not necessarily high.” This speech saw Bitcoin’s price tank to the $116k level within minutes, with altcoins also recording huge losses. The dump also saw over $200 million in long positions liquidated within an hour. BTC recovers above $118k, targets breakout above $120k The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bearish as Bitcoin recovers above $118k. The leading cryptocurrency has been consolidating over the past few weeks, but could be set for a breakout soon. Currently, Bitcoin is forming a dynamic support around the $117k level that could allow it to break out and set a new all-time high in the process. This structure coincides with prior supply zones in the $120,000–$121,600 range. The technical indicators currently paint a mixed picture as BTC is still consolidating. The Parabolic SAR dots remain above the candles, hinting at potential trend weakness. In addition to that, Bollinger Bands have tightened between $117,317 and $119,393, suggesting extreme volatility ahead. BTC is currently caught between the 20 EMA at $118,150 and the 100 EMA at $117,159, with neither the bulls nor bears in control of the market. However, the MACD is not fluctuating much, and the RSI of 53 shows that buying pressure might resume soon. A mini breakout above the $118,700 level could see BTC test the $120,500 resistance point over the next few hours. An extended rally would allow it to set a new all-time high price above $124k. However, a dip below the $117k support could see BTC tumble back to $114,600 or even test levels around $110,000.

2025-07-31 09:35:10,49292196,1753954510,Explosive Altcoin Market: Futures Trading Volume Surges to Five-Month High,"BitcoinWorld Explosive Altcoin Market: Futures Trading Volume Surges to Five-Month High Are you feeling the buzz in the cryptocurrency world? If so, you’re not alone. The digital asset space is currently witnessing a phenomenal shift, with the altcoin market taking center stage. Following Bitcoin’s impressive rally to around $120,000, it appears that the spotlight has firmly turned towards alternative cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a wave, with on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reporting a significant surge in trading activity, particularly within the perpetual futures segment. What’s Fueling the Altcoin Market Frenzy? The latest data from CryptoQuant, shared on X, paints a compelling picture: altcoins are gaining substantial momentum. This isn’t just anecdotal observation; the numbers speak volumes. Trading activity in the altcoin market , especially in perpetual futures contracts, has seen a remarkable uptick. But what exactly does this surge entail, and why is it so significant? The combined trading volume for Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoin perpetual contracts has soared to an astonishing $223.6 billion. To put this into perspective, this figure represents the highest volume recorded in five months. Even more striking is that this massive volume now constitutes 83% of the total trading volume across centralized exchanges. This dominance clearly indicates a shift in trader focus and capital allocation. Bitcoin’s Precedent: Bitcoin’s strong performance often acts as a catalyst, pulling the broader crypto market, including altcoins, upwards. Its recent surge has instilled confidence, prompting traders to explore higher-beta assets. Search for Alpha: After Bitcoin’s initial run, many traders look to altcoins for potentially larger percentage gains, leveraging their inherent volatility. Narrative-Driven Cycles: Specific narratives within the altcoin space, such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Real World Assets (RWAs), can ignite significant interest and trading volume in related projects. Why Are Perpetual Futures So Important for the Altcoin Market? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous speculation. Their surge in the altcoin market signifies several key trends: Increased Speculation: A high volume in perpetual futures indicates aggressive speculative activity. Traders are actively taking leveraged positions, betting on significant price movements in altcoins. Enhanced Liquidity: The influx of trading volume provides deeper liquidity to the altcoin futures market, making it easier for large orders to be executed without significant price slippage. Broader Participation: The accessibility of perpetual futures on centralized exchanges attracts a wide range of participants, from retail traders to institutional players, all seeking to capitalize on altcoin volatility. Market Sentiment Indicator: High open interest and trading volume in perpetual futures can be a strong indicator of bullish sentiment, as traders are willing to take on more risk for potential gains. Conversely, a sudden drop could signal a shift in sentiment. Is This Sustainable? Understanding the Benefits and Challenges of the Altcoin Market Boom The current momentum in the altcoin market presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic environment. Benefits: High Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially smaller cap projects, can offer exponential returns compared to more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Diversification: Investing in a diversified portfolio of altcoins can help spread risk and capture growth from various sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins represent the cutting edge of blockchain technology, offering exposure to new applications, protocols, and use cases that could revolutionize various industries. Challenges: Extreme Volatility: While offering high returns, altcoins are notoriously volatile. Prices can swing wildly, leading to significant gains or losses in short periods. Liquidation Risk (in Futures): Trading perpetual futures involves leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses. Incorrect predictions can lead to rapid liquidations, wiping out an entire position. Rug Pulls and Scams: The altcoin space, particularly newer or lesser-known projects, is susceptible to scams and ‘rug pulls,’ where developers abandon a project and disappear with investor funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies can impact altcoin projects, potentially leading to delistings or operational challenges. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Altcoin Market with Confidence Given the current fervor, how can you approach the altcoin market responsibly? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Thoroughly research any altcoin project you consider. Look into its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, community, and tokenomics. Understand Leverage: If you engage in futures trading, understand how leverage works. Start with low leverage and only use what you can afford to lose. Implement robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across several promising altcoins in different sectors to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Platforms like CryptoQuant provide valuable on-chain data that can offer insights. Start Small: Especially if you’re new to altcoins or futures trading, begin with smaller amounts to gain experience and understand the market dynamics before committing significant capital. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether you are a long-term investor or a short-term trader. This will influence your strategy and risk tolerance. The surge in altcoin futures trading volume is a clear signal that market participants are increasingly confident about the potential of alternative cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is not merely a consequence of Bitcoin’s rally but also reflects growing interest in the innovative solutions and high growth potential that altcoins offer. However, with great opportunity comes great responsibility. The volatility and inherent risks of the altcoin market demand a cautious yet informed approach. By prioritizing research, understanding risk management, and staying disciplined, investors and traders can better position themselves to navigate this exciting, albeit challenging, landscape. The coming months will undoubtedly be crucial for the altcoin market . Whether this surge leads to sustained growth or a period of consolidation, one thing is clear: altcoins are here to stay, and their influence on the broader crypto ecosystem is only set to grow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Altcoin Market Surge Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract in crypto? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they can be held indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. They are popular for leveraged trading, allowing traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. Q2: Why is the surge in altcoin perpetual futures volume significant? A significant surge in altcoin perpetual futures volume indicates heightened speculative interest and increased liquidity in the altcoin market. It suggests that traders are actively taking leveraged positions, expecting substantial price movements, and reflects a strong bullish sentiment towards altcoins. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s price affect the altcoin market? Bitcoin’s price often acts as a bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin performs well, it typically instills confidence, leading capital to flow into altcoins as traders seek higher percentage gains. Conversely, a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price can trigger a sell-off across the altcoin market. Q4: What are the main risks of trading altcoin futures? The primary risks include high volatility, which can lead to rapid and significant losses, especially when using leverage. There’s also the risk of liquidation, where your position is automatically closed if the market moves against you and your margin falls below a certain level. Additionally, market manipulation and the inherent risks of specific altcoin projects are concerns. Q5: How can I protect myself when investing in altcoins? To protect yourself, always conduct thorough research (DYOR) on any project. Understand its fundamentals, team, and technology. Implement strict risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and only risking a small percentage of your portfolio on any single trade. Diversify your investments across multiple altcoins and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Did you find this article insightful?

2025-07-31 09:34:08,49295871,1753954448,"Shiba Inu Was Big in 2021, But This Under-$0.003 Coin Will Create 5x More Millionaires Than SHIB in 2025","Back in 2021, some people turned a few hundred bucks into thousands. Others became full-on millionaires. For a while, SHIB ruled the meme coin space. But in 2025, that crown may not belong to Shiba Inu anymore. A new name is making noise—not just hype, but with real numbers and serious momentum. That name is LILPEPE, and at under $0.003 per token, it’s quietly building up to outperform SHIB in every way imaginable. Analysts are even predicting a 98,476% rise in the next 7 months, and with over $12.5 million raised so far in its presale, the buzz is turning into something much bigger. For those who missed the SHIB wave or sold too early, LILPEPE offers a second shot worth paying attention to. Shiba Inu Took Off in 2021 — But Times Have Changed When SHIB started blowing up, no one took it seriously. It was just another meme coin with a funny name. But something happened. It got picked up on TikTok, Elon Musk tweeted about Dogecoin, and the market started rewarding memes more than fundamentals. In that wild wave, SHIB saw its market cap rocket, creating tons of millionaires almost overnight. But here’s the thing—SHIB had no real utility when it started. It was all community, all hype. And while that worked back then, 2025 is a different beast. Investors are smarter now. Meme coins need more than a catchy name—they need a product, a plan, and real potential for growth. Why LILPEPE Is Built Different LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin trying to copy the past. It’s built on a next-gen Ethereum Layer-2 chain, giving it faster speeds, lower gas fees, and better scalability. More importantly, it’s doing this with zero transaction tax, something SHIB holders never had. The team behind LILPEPE has also laid out a clear roadmap that includes staking, DEX integration, major exchange listings, and even an NFT ecosystem. But the real kicker? LILPEPE is still in its presale, and people are already cashing in. The presale is currently in Stage 8, priced at just $0.0017. That’s already a 70% increase from Stage 1, where the earliest buyers picked it up at $0.0010. Yet even at this stage, investors have a clear 76.4% gain potential if the token hits its projected launch price of $0.0030. LILPEPE just got listed on CoinMarketCap to make things more exciting, giving it more exposure and credibility. That’s a move SHIB didn’t make until much later in its journey. Presale Is Almost Sold Out — And The Next Jump Is Imminent As of right now, Stage 8 is 92.67% filled. The total funds raised have already crossed $12.5 million, and once the final tokens in this stage are sold, the price will automatically jump to $0.0018 in Stage 9. That’s another 10% gain, gone in an instant. This kind of fast-moving presale pressure is what drives FOMO. And with only 15 stages in total, the window to buy LILPEPE under $0.002 is closing faster than most people realize. If you think it’s just hype, consider this: early SHIB holders saw massive gains because they bought before the noise. LILPEPE is still before the noise, but it’s making all the right moves—getting listed on major platforms, trending on social media, and building a real utility on top of its meme appeal. Final Thoughts — Don’t Miss This One LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin with a funny frog face. It’s a full-blown crypto project with serious upside, a clear roadmap, and one of the most active presales of 2025. At the moment, the coin is trading at $0.0017 and is expected to reach $0.0030 upon launch. This coin is truly at the beginning of its explosive growth. Everyone remembers the news concerning Shiba Inu back in 2021. But in 2025, LILPEPE could make history. With the potential for a 98,476% rise and five times the millionaire-making momentum of SHIB, now might be the best time to get in before the rest of the world wakes up to what’s coming. You can join the presale and see all the details at littlepepe.com . If you feel the energy and want to be part of the next big crypto story, now’s your chance. Before Stage 9 hits—before the price jumps again—make your move.

2025-07-31 09:30:11,49291910,1753954211,Bitcoin Investment: ANAP Holdings’ Bold Move into Crypto,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: ANAP Holdings’ Bold Move into Crypto Imagine your favorite fashion brand making significant moves in the digital asset space. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s today’s reality. Japanese fashion powerhouse ANAP Holdings has once again turned heads in the financial world with its latest Bitcoin investment , signaling growing confidence among traditional businesses in the decentralized future. ANAP Holdings’ Strategic Bitcoin Investment: A Fashion Statement? Japanese fashion brand ANAP Holdings recently announced another substantial acquisition of Bitcoin, adding 16.9786 BTC to its reserves. This elevates ANAP’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 831.1191 BTC. For a company known for trendy apparel, this consistent accumulation speaks volumes about its long-term vision and belief in digital assets. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the Bitcoin market. The company has steadily built its crypto treasury, with a clear ambition to acquire over 1,000 BTC by August. This aggressive target highlights a profound commitment to Bitcoin as a core component of their financial strategy, moving beyond traditional fiat assets. What compels a fashion brand to make such a significant Bitcoin investment ? It’s a tangible example of how companies view Bitcoin not merely as speculative, but as a legitimate store of value and a strategic hedge against economic uncertainties. Why Are Companies Like ANAP Making a Bitcoin Investment? Traditional corporate treasury strategies are evolving. Factors like inflation, negative real interest rates, and geopolitical instability push companies to explore alternatives. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing institutional acceptance, offers a compelling option. Key reasons for a substantial Bitcoin investment : Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s capped supply (21 million coins) makes it an attractive hedge against inflation and currency debasement, preserving purchasing power. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin shows significant long-term growth. Companies aim for substantial returns on idle cash. Diversification: Bitcoin diversifies a treasury portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk by adding an uncorrelated asset class. Technological Alignment: Investing in Bitcoin signals innovation, enhancing brand image and appealing to tech-savvy consumers. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: What Are the Risks? While benefits are compelling, corporate Bitcoin investment has challenges. Companies must carefully weigh these factors: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s swings offer opportunities but also risks of substantial losses, impacting financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulations across jurisdictions can affect legality, tax treatment, or operations. Security Concerns: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security to prevent hacks or loss of keys. Accounting Complexities: Bitcoin’s intangible asset classification can lead to non-cash impairment charges if prices drop. ANAP’s steady increase suggests they manage these risks, viewing them as acceptable trade-offs for long-term benefits. Pioneers of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: Who Else is Leading the Charge? ANAP Holdings joins a growing cohort of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, famously spearheaded this trend, adopting Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset. Other notable examples include: Tesla: The EV giant made a significant Bitcoin investment in early 2021, legitimizing Bitcoin for many mainstream investors. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company not only holds Bitcoin but integrates it into Cash App, allowing users to buy, sell, and store it. These pioneers demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits for companies of various sizes and industries to incorporate Bitcoin. ANAP’s entry from the fashion sector broadens this corporate trend’s appeal. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: What Does ANAP’s Move Signify? ANAP’s ambitious Bitcoin investment strategy is a powerful signal. It suggests corporate adoption of digital assets is a fundamental shift in how businesses manage financial resources. As more companies see benefits and ecosystem maturity, a snowball effect is possible. This trend could lead to: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: Companies embracing Bitcoin normalize its status, reducing skepticism. New Financial Products: Corporate demand will spur innovation in traditional finance. Greater Regulatory Clarity: Growing corporate adoption compels clearer government guidelines. ANAP’s commitment to 1,000 BTC by August is a bold statement. It shows conviction that Bitcoin is a viable, strategic asset for established businesses to future-proof their balance sheets in an unpredictable global economy. Conclusion: Fashioning a Future with Bitcoin ANAP Holdings’ expanding Bitcoin investment portfolio is a compelling narrative in corporate digital asset adoption. It shows a forward-thinking approach to treasury management, recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as an inflation hedge, value driver, and innovation symbol. While challenges persist, companies like ANAP pave the way, proving that strategic Bitcoin allocation can be a viable and lucrative part of modern corporate financial strategy.

2025-07-31 09:30:00,49291993,1753954200,Top New Crypto That Could Dominate in 2025 Like Solana (SOL) in 2021,"Summer 2025 is shaping up to be the make-or-break season for crypto hunters, and the clock is ticking.

2025-07-31 09:27:14,49291794,1753954034,"Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) Set to Soar in Q3, but This Under-$0.002 Token Might Deliver the Biggest Gains This Cycle","The crypto market hit a new peak in the past week, reaching $4 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are among the top gainers. Institutional interest, new developments, and a bullish market mood drive both assets' surge. However, while ETH and ADA are expected to maintain their resurgence in Q3, a relatively unknown meme-based project priced under $0.002 quietly stirs up FOMO. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , a Layer 2 meme-centric blockchain, is gaining traction for all the right reasons. Could this be the surprise winner of the cycle? Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Poised for a Historic Breakout Ethereum is no stranger to market cycles, but Q3 2025 is shaping up to be special. Over the past three months, ETH has surged over 150%, fueled by overwhelming inflows into Ethereum ETFs, massive corporate accumulation, and a looming supply crunch. Ethereum ETFs saw $296.5 million in net inflows in the past day, marking 12 consecutive days of capital injection from institutional investors. The momentum is also visible at the blockchain level. One wallet bought over $397 million in ETH as Ethereum whales picked up 150,000 ETH in four days. These accumulating trends show a long-term conviction in Ethereum's future as a credible store of wealth and the decentralized network's backbone. Ethereum Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Moreover, the recent passage of the GENUIS Act is expected to spark a broader crypto rally. Analysts expect ETH's inclusion in more government-backed portfolios and an expanded role in treasuries. The market has already responded positively to the debut of the Pectra upgrade. With clear legislation now underway, ETH might be the star of this crypto cycle. As of this report, ETH hovers near $3,700 and is eyeing resistance levels around $4,100. A decisive breakout could send it well past the $10,000 mark this quarter. Cardano (ADA) Gains Traction With Apple Integration & Whale Interest Cardano has also carved out its bullish path with key ecosystem integrations and a surge in community interest. ADA is currently one of the top-performing assets in the top 10, posting an impressive 30-day gain of 62%. It’s rapidly approaching the symbolic $1 level, and momentum doesn’t seem to be slowing. Cardano Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Cardano's recent highlight includes the integration of CardanoKit , a native Swift library that allows for ADA support in the iOS ecosystem. This potentially paves the way for Apple Pay compatibility, opening Cardano to millions of iPhone users and adding serious utility to the token's value proposition. Meanwhile, whale activity has exploded. ADA open interest in futures surged to a record high of $1.7 billion, surpassing its 2021 peak. Trading volumes have followed suit, and investor sentiment has flipped fully bullish, with the Fear and Greed Index at 67. As Cardano rides this renewed wave of interest, some analysts predict it could climb toward the $1.20–$1.50 range, or even challenge the $10 mark if broader adoption takes off.

2025-07-31 09:23:03,49293218,1753953783,"Ether Machine adds 15,000 ETH, becomes the 3rd largest corporate holder of Ethereum","The Ether Machine has become the third-largest corporate holder of Ethereum after its latest acquisition of 15,000 ETH. Celebrating Ethereum’s 10-year anniversary, the company added $56.9 million worth of ETH on July 30 at an average price of $3,809.97 per token. The purchase brings The Ether Machine’s total holdings to 334,757 ETH, cementing its position among the top firms accumulating Ethereum as a long-term strategic asset. The latest acquisition was executed through The Ether Reserve LLC, the firm’s dedicated treasury arm. According to the company, the purchase was funded from a $97 million private placement and marks the start of its broader treasury deployment. As of now, the Ether Reserve still holds $407 million in cash reserves earmarked for additional ETH purchases shortly. “We couldn’t imagine a better way to commemorate Ethereum’s 10th birthday than by deepening our commitment to ether,” co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys said in the press release. “We are just getting started. Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term — not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.” Nasdaq listing on the horizon Ether Machine was formed through a business combination between The Ether Reserve and Nasdaq-listed Dynamix Corporation earlier this year. The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals, will see the merged entity go public under the ticker symbol “ETHM.” The transaction includes over $1.5 billion in fully committed capital, anchored by a $645 million Ethereum contribution from Keys. An additional $800 million in equity commitments has been secured from a consortium of institutional backers, including Kraken, Pantera Capital, Blockchain.com, Electric Capital, Archetype, and 1Roundtable/10T Holdings. Upon listing, ETHM is expected to debut with the largest Ethereum treasury of any publicly traded company. Its core strategy centres on generating ETH-denominated yield through staking, restaking, and structured DeFi participation, a model that’s fast becoming a staple among companies adopting an Ethereum treasury strategy. When operational, Ether Machine also plans to offer Ethereum-native infrastructure services to institutional clients, DAOs, and developers, including validator node operations and custom block-building tools. Corporate race for ETH intensifies Over the past few months, Ethereum seems to have become the new coveted treasury asset , mostly due to its passive yield potential through staking and its central role in powering decentralised finance and tokenised real-world assets. Experts at Standard Chartered have reported that public companies have already acquired 1% of Ethereum’s circulating supply since June, and the total corporate holdings now exceed 1.26 million ETH. The bank estimates this figure could rise tenfold in the coming years. It’s not just new capital that’s flowing into Ethereum; companies from outside the crypto sector are also pivoting toward ETH as they rethink their treasury strategies. One of the boldest examples is Nasdaq-listed 180 Life Sciences, which recently announced plans to exit biotech entirely and rebrand as ETHZilla. Another new entrant, FG Nexus — formerly Fundamental Global — is also pivoting to Ethereum. The firm launched a $200 million raise to fund ETH acquisitions. Among existing players, SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion Technologies remain at the forefront of corporate ETH accumulation. SharpLink , often dubbed the “MicroStrategy for Ethereum,” recently expanded its holdings to 438,190 ETH; however, BitMIne currently leads the pack with over 625,000 Ether in its reserves as per data from StrategicETHReserve.

2025-07-31 09:19:30,49293216,1753953570,"Analysts say this could be the Solana of 2025, but it’s still under $0.04","According to their latest projection, MUTM could climb to over $2 before 2026, setting the stage for a possible 5,614% return from today’s price of just $0.035. Even without future forecasts, the current setup is impressive. Investors entering at Phase 6 are already positioned for nearly 6x returns at the public listing price of $0.06. But those who wait may end up buying closer to the top, while early-phase participants from Phase 1 (at $0.01) are already looking at 3.5x gains on paper. With a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens and increasing presale demand, this token is starting to look like more than just another DeFi play — it’s shaping up to be a next-generation ecosystem for lending, stablecoins, and passive income. P2C lending is building to deliver passive rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a permissionless and non-custodial Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending model designed to attract both conservative and capital-efficient investors. In this system, users will be able to deposit assets like ETH, USDT, or other blue-chip tokens into a shared liquidity pool. The protocol will then allocate these funds to overcollateralized borrowers, with APYs adjusting dynamically based on pool utilization. For example, a user depositing $20,000 worth of ETH will be able to earn around 9.4% APY—automatically paid as interest accrues within the smart contract. Borrowers, in turn, will unlock up to 70% Loan-to-Value (LTV) against the same $20,000 in ETH, enabling access to $14,000 in stablecoins without needing to sell their underlying asset. All loans will remain overcollateralized, reducing protocol-level risk while enabling flexible, instant lending. Alongside this, the platform will also support Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for users seeking tailored agreements. In the P2P model, borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, often involving volatile tokens like memcoins or specific loan durations. This option will cater to traders and advanced users looking for custom opportunities, while the P2C model will serve those prioritizing automated, risk-adjusted yield on high-quality assets. Stablecoin engine with peg protection and smart minting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just building a lending network—it’s architecting a full decentralized finance backbone, starting with its stablecoin system. The native stablecoin will only be minted when loans are issued and will be destroyed immediately upon repayment or liquidation. This controlled mint-burn mechanism ensures strict supply control and helps avoid the inflationary pitfalls seen in many algorithmic stablecoin designs. Interest rates on borrowing will be governed at the protocol level. For example, if the stablecoin dips below its $1 peg, borrowing interest rates may be adjusted upward to shrink supply and restore equilibrium. Minting privileges are restricted to pre-approved smart contracts that enforce strict overcollateralization, ensuring all loans backed by the stablecoin remain safe and trustless. By building this system directly into the protocol’s architecture, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to offer a stable, scalable DeFi experience while enabling cross-platform interoperability through its upcoming Layer-2 deployment, drastically reducing gas fees and enhancing throughput. Phase 6 presale is heating up — time to get in Right now, Phase 6 of the presale is live with MUTM priced at $0.035, and already 7% of the 170 million Phase 6 tokens have been sold. Over 14,700 holders have already joined, contributing more than $13.70 million to the presale round. The next price jump is locked in at $0.040 in Phase 7—a 15% increase from the current rate, making this phase a critical window for entry before prices surge again. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rewarding early supporters with a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. And to reinforce platform security and trust, the protocol has launched a $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK, achieving a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00, reflecting high audit reliability. The project’s Twitter following has already crossed 12,000 users, pointing to a growing and active community base. With public launch around the corner and listing set at $0.06, investors entering now are front-running what might become one of 2025’s most celebrated DeFi breakouts. The momentum is building—and so is the price. Don’t miss the next Solana-like surge The window to buy MUTM under $0.04 is closing fast. With the analyst forecast targeting $2+ by 2026, the 57x return potential is already catching the attention of seasoned whales. Those who watched Solana (SOL) soar from obscurity into the top 10 are now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big opportunity. This isn’t about hype—it’s about timing. And in crypto, timing is everything.
