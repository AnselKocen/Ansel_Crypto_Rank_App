While macro uncertainty has dulled enthusiasm for riskier plays like meme coins , an 8% weekend bounce could signal the start of a new DOGE uptrend. With the ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariff pause now over and higher duties on 92 countries set to take effect August 7, risk-on sentiment has been weakened amid fears of a mid-2025 bear market repeat. However, speculation around a potential September rate cut remains high, with the potential to stimulate new inflows into risk assets like cryptocurrencies as the cost of borrowing lowers.

Dogecoin Price Analysis: Is the Bull Market Ready to Continue? The breakout from the ‚Äúbear market trendline‚Äù noted by Cantonese Cat feeds into a broader falling wedge pattern, acting as the upper boundary to its consolidation.

A successful back-test of this trendline has now confirmed it as support, marking a higher low and validating the wedge breakout structure. Momentum indicators are flashing green. The RSI is now back above the neutral line at 52 after briefly dipping, a sign that buyers are in control. The MACD line tells a similar story, maintaining its lead on the signal line despite a slight hiccup, signalling a strong short-term uptrend taking root. If this momentum holds, the wedge breakout targets past resistance at $0.25 for a potential 25% gain. Should this level flip to support, the rally may extend toward the mid-July high at $0.2875 in a 38% gain, clearing a path for a continuation of the bull run.

2025-08-05 19:10:17,49597312,1754421017,Russia received less than $10 billion from oil and gas in July,"Russia has registered a significant decline in revenues from oil and gas amid a new spike in geopolitical tensions with the West, threatening Moscow‚Äôs income from energy sales. The data indicating a 27% year-on-year drop registered in July comes out along with a projected $150-million shortfall in budget receipts from the same sources in August. Russia receives less than $10 billion from July oil and gas sales Russia‚Äôs oil and natural gas revenues fell by 27% in July 2025, compared to the same month of 2024, the official TASS news agency reported, quoting numbers published by the finance ministry in Moscow. In absolute terms, the revenues were down to 787.3 billion rubles (approx. $9.8 billion), from last July‚Äôs 1.079 trillion rubles (almost $13.5 billion), the official figures show. Between January and July this year alone, Russia lost some 18.5% of oil and gas revenues, which decreased to a total of 5.522 trillion rubles ($69 billion) for the whole period, the Ministry of Finance ( Minfin ) added, further detailing: ‚ÄúTaxes on oil and gas condensate extraction brought 885.2 billion rubles ($11 billion) to the budget in July 2025, which is 34.3% lower than last year.‚Äù At the same time, the department registered a threefold increase in receipts from a special mineral extraction tax and export duty on natural gas in July, which reached 76.9 billion rubles ($960 million) in 2025, up from last year‚Äôs 25.1 billion rubles ($313 million). Russia expects $150 million decline in budget income from oil and gas in August Meanwhile, the ministry also admitted that next month the shortfall in oil and gas revenues to the federal budget may reach 12.1 billion rubles (over $151 million). Pointing out that the deviation between forecast and actual figures was positive in July, when it stood at 5.9 billion rubles (nearly $73.8 million), the Minfin said: ‚ÄúThe volume of additional oil and gas revenues of the federal budget is projected at -12.1 billion rubles in August 2025.‚Äù The finance ministry also revealed that payments from the state budget to oil companies under the so-called ‚Äúfuel damper mechanism‚Äù amounted to 59.9 billion rubles in July, or $749 million in July. This is the first time these payments have risen this year. Their lowest level was in June, at 34.5 billion rubles, and the highest total, 156.4 billion rubles, was recorded in January. Under the scheme, introduced in 2019, if the difference between export fuel prices and the indicative domestic price determined by law is positive, the state pays oil companies. And if the difference is negative, oil companies refund the budget. The latest official stats on oil and gas trade come amid growing pressure on Russian energy exports, as part of Western sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow‚Äôs ability to fund its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. In mid-July, the European Union approved a new price cap for Russian oil, set to around $15 below global market rates, with its latest, 18th package of punitive measures. The EU also wants to thwart any efforts to restore the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the future. At the end of last month, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on India, accusing the world‚Äôs most populous democracy of being a major buyer of Russian energy, among other sins. Shortly after, Russian oil tankers were reportedly seen idling off the Indian coast. However, officials in New Delhi made it clear on the weekend that no instructions have been issued for Indian companies to reduce Russian oil imports. And this week, Russia itself slammed the tariff threats coming from Washington, stressing India has the right to choose its trade partners.

2025-08-05 19:10:12,49596949,1754421012,Crucial Fed Rate Cut Unlikely Soon: What BofA CEO‚Äôs Dire Warning Means for Your Finances,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Fed Rate Cut Unlikely Soon: What BofA CEO‚Äôs Dire Warning Means for Your Finances The financial world is buzzing with a significant announcement from Bank of America (BofA). Brian Moynihan, the bank‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer, recently shared insights that could shape our financial futures. According to reports by Walter Bloomberg on X, Moynihan conveyed that BofA‚Äôs own economists do not foresee a Fed rate cut happening in the near term. This perspective is rooted in the expectation that taming inflation will take longer than many initially hoped. Why is the Federal Reserve Holding Steady on Interest Rates? Many have been eagerly anticipating a shift in the Federal Reserve ‚Äòs monetary policy. However, the latest commentary from BofA‚Äôs top brass suggests patience is key. The core reason for this cautious stance is the persistent challenge of high inflation . While there have been signs of moderation, the pace of decline isn‚Äôt rapid enough for the Fed to consider easing its tight monetary grip. Persistent Inflation: Consumer prices, though off their peaks, remain elevated. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs primary goal is price stability, meaning inflation needs to consistently move towards its 2% target. Strong Labor Market: A robust job market, while positive for employment, can also contribute to wage growth pressures, which in turn can fuel inflation. Economic Resilience: Despite higher interest rates , the U.S. economy has shown remarkable resilience, suggesting that current policies haven‚Äôt yet cooled demand sufficiently to bring inflation down quickly. This careful approach from the Federal Reserve aims to avoid prematurely loosening policy, which could risk a resurgence of inflationary pressures. Therefore, the prevailing sentiment among BofA economists is that the current high interest rates are here to stay for a while longer. What Does This Economic Outlook Mean for Your Wallet? If the Federal Reserve maintains its current stance on interest rates , it has significant implications for everyone, from individual consumers to large corporations. A prolonged period of higher rates impacts borrowing costs, savings, and investment strategies. For instance, mortgage rates, car loans, and credit card interest will likely remain elevated, making borrowing more expensive. Conversely, savers might see slightly better returns on their deposits, though these often don‚Äôt keep pace with the true cost of living if inflation remains high. Businesses face higher costs for capital, which can affect expansion plans and hiring. This complex economic outlook requires careful financial planning. Borrowing Costs: Expect higher rates on new loans and potentially variable-rate debts. Savings: Savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) may offer more attractive returns. Investments: Fixed-income investments might become more appealing, while growth stocks could face headwinds due to higher discount rates. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed financial decisions in the current environment. The Bank of America‚Äôs perspective reinforces the need for vigilance. Navigating Future Economic Uncertainty: What‚Äôs Next? The consensus from Bank of America‚Äôs economists paints a clear picture: don‚Äôt expect a rapid pivot from the Federal Reserve. The battle against inflation is proving to be a marathon, not a sprint. This means individuals and businesses should continue to plan for an environment of sustained higher interest rates . It‚Äôs an important reminder that economic forecasts are always subject to change, but current data points towards a patient Fed. As we move forward, monitoring economic indicators such as consumer price index (CPI) reports, employment figures, and retail sales will be vital. These data points will ultimately guide the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decisions regarding any potential Fed rate cut . The key takeaway is that the path to lower rates is likely to be gradual and data-dependent, challenging previous market expectations for swift action. In conclusion, Brian Moynihan‚Äôs comments underscore a realistic view of the current economic landscape. The persistent fight against inflation means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to implement a Fed rate cut anytime soon. This continued period of higher interest rates will influence everything from your mortgage payments to investment returns, urging us all to adapt our financial strategies to this evolving economic outlook . Staying informed about the Federal Reserve‚Äôs actions and inflation trends is more important than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason Bank of America‚Äôs CEO believes a Fed rate cut is unlikely soon? A1: According to BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, the bank‚Äôs economists believe the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates soon because inflation is expected to take longer to decline to their target. Q2: How do higher interest rates affect consumers? A2: Higher interest rates generally mean increased borrowing costs for consumers on things like mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt. Conversely, savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) may offer slightly better returns. Q3: What is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs primary goal regarding inflation? A3: The Federal Reserve‚Äôs primary goal concerning inflation is to achieve price stability, typically aiming for a 2% inflation rate over the long run. Q4: Will the Fed ever cut interest rates, or will they stay high indefinitely? A4: While a Fed rate cut is not expected soon, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decisions are data-dependent. If inflation consistently moves towards its 2% target and economic conditions warrant, rate cuts could eventually occur, but the current outlook suggests a prolonged period of higher rates. Q5: Where can I find reliable updates on the economic outlook and interest rates? A5: Reliable updates on the economic outlook and interest rates can be found from official sources like the Federal Reserve, major financial news outlets, and reputable economists‚Äô reports, such as those from Bank of America.

Trading between a long-term descending resistance and a gradually rising support level, the pair has seen its volatility and volume compress on the monthly time frame. Very soon #XRP will break out of this 5 year consolidation vs Bitcoin. The XRP price will explode and rise so quickly and the vast majority will be left behind! pic.twitter.com/UNdkUX1oyF ‚Äî CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 5, 2025 As of report time, XRP is trading at 0.00002660 BTC, reflecting a modest decline of about 0.52% on the day. The trading range over the last several months has remained tight, between 0.00002000 BTC and 0.00003000 BTC, with price steadily approaching the triangle‚Äôs upper boundary. The key breakout level to watch lies in the 0.00002750 BTC to 0.00002850 BTC zone. A strong move above this threshold, particularly with a decisive monthly close, could mark the end of the consolidation phase and the start of a new macro rally for XRP/BTC. Historically, symmetrical triangles on high timeframes such as this tend to result in powerful moves as market indecision gives way to directional momentum. Historic Price Context and Relative Valuation XRP‚Äôs performance against Bitcoin has seen dramatic cycles over the past decade. During its peak in May 2017, XRP hit an all-time high of approximately 0.00023800 BTC per coin. Since then, it has been in a long-term downtrend, losing over 90% of its value in BTC terms from that high. Despite multiple short-term rallies, such as the bounce in early 2021 to 0.00002050 BTC and a recovery in late 2023 to 0.00002240 BTC, XRP has struggled to reclaim dominance relative to Bitcoin. However, the current price compression and formation of higher lows suggest the possibility of a trend reversal , particularly as the triangle pattern nears completion. Technical Indicators Align for Breakout From a technical standpoint, the 200-day moving average (shown on the chart) is beginning to flatten, a possible sign that downside momentum is waning. Volume remains low ‚Äî a typical trait in the final stages of consolidation ‚Äî and could be a precursor to an incoming spike once breakout confirmation occurs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts often look for a breakout accompanied by a rise in volume and momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) turning bullish. In past cycles, XRP has moved aggressively once it broke from long-term patterns, often doubling or tripling in value within weeks. CryptoBull warns that this coming move could be swift and unforgiving to those waiting on the sidelines, stating that ‚Äúthe XRP price will explode and rise so quickly and the vast majority will be left behind.‚Äù Market Implications and Closing Outlook The XRP/BTC breakout is more than just a chart pattern ; it represents a potential shift in capital rotation within the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin trades sideways above ‚Çø0.00002660 per XRP, and the XRP/BTC pair teeters on the edge of a seven-year triangle, the setup has caught the attention of traders hunting for asymmetric upside opportunities. If the breakout confirms, XRP could rapidly regain ground lost to Bitcoin over the years, potentially revisiting the 0.00005000 BTC level in subsequent months. With technical conditions ripening and market interest building, XRP‚Äôs multi-year consolidation may soon come to a dramatic end, just as CryptoBull predicts.

2025-08-05 19:04:09,49596711,1754420649,Vitalik Buterin Proposes Significant Changes to Ethereum: Here‚Äôs What Will Happen If They Are Accepted,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is making headlines with his proposal for a radical reform of the network's fee system. Buterin aims to introduce a new system he calls a ‚Äúmulti-dimensional fee model‚Äù in an effort to overcome the limitations of Ethereum's current fee structure and increase the network's long-term scalability. In his proposal, co-authored with researcher Anders Elowsson, Buterin suggests implementing a single maximum fee limit (max_fee) system across all resources, rather than requiring users to set separate fee limits for each network resource, such as compute, storage, and data, when sending a transaction. This structure would allow for dynamic fee allocation, enabling more efficient resource utilization. Traffic on the Ethereum network has decreased recently, and gas fees have been below 1 Gwei for an extended period. This low demand environment further highlights the inadequacies of the current fee structure. Buterin's proposed new system promises a sustainable and stable fee architecture that can respond more flexibly to these fluctuations. Related News: Pay Attention to This Date in Bitcoin: Critical Country to Discuss Adding BTC to Its Treasury Key components of the new model include: A unique fee update mechanism A generalized reference pricing method There is a gas compensation system to ensure cost stability. Currently, the Ethereum network handles general transactions (EIP-1559) and blob data transactions (EIP-4844) through separate systems. Buterin's proposal aims to combine these two systems under a multi-dimensional fee model, providing a consistent approach in an environment where resource usage is increasingly diverse. The first phase of the new system will begin with the calldata component, which significantly impacts transaction propagation speed. It will then be extended to other resources within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The proposed model will be implemented gradually, ensuring backward compatibility to avoid disrupting the existing user experience. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-05 19:00:48,49596613,1754420448,Is Bitcoin Overheated? Key Signal Flashes Warning Similar To 2021 And 2024 Market Tops,"Bitcoin is undergoing a sharp correction after losing the $115K support level, triggering a wave of uncertainty across the market. Following weeks of consolidation in a tight range, BTC has broken down, fueling debates among analysts about the asset‚Äôs short-term direction. Some experts warn that Bitcoin could face further declines as investors take profits and sentiment turns cautious. Others maintain a more optimistic view, suggesting that the correction is a healthy pause before BTC makes another attempt to reclaim its all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Selling More Aggressively As Bull Cycle Matures: Risk Appetite Fades? Key data from CryptoQuant adds another layer to the analysis. Metrics indicate that Bitcoin is currently in an ‚Äúoverheated‚Äù state, with valuation indicators signaling excessive bullish momentum. This suggests that the current consolidation phase may extend further as the market works to reset. Until demand stabilizes and new liquidity flows in, Bitcoin could continue to trade in a volatile environment, with the $112K‚Äì$115K range acting as a critical battleground between bulls and bears. With the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy and global macroeconomic factors still in play, Bitcoin‚Äôs next major move will likely depend on a combination of market sentiment, institutional demand, and the broader risk appetite of investors in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model Signals Overvaluation Top analyst Darkfost recently shared insights on X, highlighting the significance of the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow reversion (S2F) chart as a reliable indicator to assess Bitcoin‚Äôs valuation cycles. According to Darkfost, when the S2F metric rises above a value of 3, it typically indicates that Bitcoin is entering an overheated phase, signaling a high probability of a market correction. Currently, the S2F value is approaching this critical threshold, prompting Darkfost to caution investors that it may be an opportune moment to lock in profits before a deeper correction unfolds. Darkfost‚Äôs analysis points to historical patterns where similar S2F readings have preceded substantial price declines. In September 2021, Bitcoin dropped from $63,500 to $30,800 after the S2F metric crossed into the overvaluation zone. Again, in November 2021, BTC crashed from $67,000 to $15,800 following a peak S2F signal. More recently, in March 2024, Bitcoin corrected sharply from $73,000 to $54,000 after entering overheated territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Holds Strong Despite Price Drop: Accumulation Trend Remains Intact This preset alert system, designed for long-term market participants, serves as a strategic tool to help investors navigate Bitcoin‚Äôs volatile cycles. While the current correction might seem abrupt, Darkfost emphasizes that such pullbacks are essential for the market to reset and build a sustainable foundation for future growth. Investors are urged to remain cautious and monitor the S2F chart closely as Bitcoin navigates this critical phase. BTC Struggles To Reclaim The $115K Level Bitcoin is attempting to recover after its recent decline, currently trading around $115,019 as shown in the 8-hour chart. The price has managed to bounce from the $112K support zone but faces strong resistance at the $115,724 level, which previously acted as a key support during the two-week consolidation range in July. The 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are now positioned just above the current price, adding to the overhead resistance. The 200-day SMA around $110,677 continues to provide solid support, keeping the overall uptrend intact for now. However, BTC must reclaim the $115,724 level and consolidate above it to regain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Accelerate: Investor Behavior Shifts After Months Of Decline Volume has been relatively low during the recent bounce, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction. If Bitcoin fails to break above the $115K resistance decisively, it risks falling back to test the $112K zone again. On the upside, a successful breakout above $115,724 could open the path to retest the $122,077 all-time high resistance.

2025-08-05 19:00:28,49596543,1754420428,Solana Price Jumps as Seeker Phones Ship Globally: Is This the Catalyst for a SOL Bull Run?,"Solana Mobile has officially begun global shipments of its second-generation Web3 smartphone, the Seeker, to over 50 countries, and its launch has directly impact the Solana price. With more than 150,000 pre-orders and a feature-rich design tailored for crypto users and developers, the device is already igniting renewed bullish sentiment in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. Following the announcement on August 4, the SOL price surged to around $169.05, marking a 6% gain since the start of the month. The Seeker builds on the Saga‚Äôs foundation, but this time enters a stronger DeFi market, with over $9.8 billion in total value locked. The Seeker features 2,500+ decentralized apps via Solana dApp Store 2.0, a built-in Solflare wallet, secure Seed Vault, and a Genesis NFT that unlocks exclusive airdrops and rewards. These enhancements, alongside the yet-to-launch SKR incentive token, have positioned the Seeker as more than just a phone, it‚Äôs a mobile-native DeFi portal. Can SOL‚Äôs Mobile Ecosystem Trigger a Solana Price Breakout? Solana‚Äôs market structure reflects cautious optimism. After rebounding from strong demand zones between $150 and $155, SOL is now testing resistance at $171.12, a key Supertrend level and 0.382 Fibonacci barrier. A breakout above this zone could push the price toward $175.80 and eventually the critical $180‚Äì$185 resistance region. Technical indicators remain mixed. The RSI on the 30-minute chart sits at 58.57, while the Parabolic SAR has flipped bullish. However, netflows show $9.81M in outflows, suggesting the rally is not yet fully backed by strong spot demand. Analysts argue a confirmed daily close above $175 would validate a bullish reversal. $67.5M Revenue and Growing Ecosystem Support Price Upside Priced between $450‚Äì$500, the Seeker phone could generate at least $67.5 million in revenue for Solana Mobile. More importantly, the device encourages network engagement, SOL usage, and potential airdrop farming, echoing the Saga‚Äôs success story with BONK. As Solana continues innovating in mobile-first Web3 infrastructure and its DeFi ecosystem grows, the Seeker‚Äôs success could become a long-term bullish catalyst. While short-term price movement depends on volume and resistance breakout, the broader fundamentals suggest SOL could revisit the $200‚Äì$300 range by year-end.

2025-08-05 19:00:12,49596566,1754420412,Exciting News: Coinbase Listing Roadmap Adds COSMOSDYDX Token,"BitcoinWorld Exciting News: Coinbase Listing Roadmap Adds COSMOSDYDX Token Exciting news for the crypto community has just dropped! Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, recently announced a significant update to its Coinbase listing roadmap . They confirmed the addition of the COSMOSDYDX token , signaling potential new opportunities for traders and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This development has sparked considerable interest, especially among those following dYdX crypto and other promising digital assets. What Does This Coinbase Listing Roadmap Update Mean for You? The Coinbase listing roadmap serves as an early indicator for assets the exchange is considering for future trading. While inclusion on the roadmap does not guarantee a listing, it often precedes one, providing valuable transparency for the market. For the COSMOSDYDX token , this addition suggests Coinbase‚Äôs keen interest in supporting the dYdX ecosystem, which is a prominent decentralized derivatives exchange. This move could significantly enhance the visibility and accessibility of dYdX crypto for a wider audience. When a major platform like Coinbase considers a token, it often leads to several key benefits: Increased Liquidity: More trading volume makes it easier to buy and sell the asset. Enhanced Credibility: A listing on Coinbase is widely seen as a stamp of approval, building trust. Broader Adoption: Millions of new users gain direct access to the asset, fostering growth. Understanding the COSMOSDYDX Token and dYdX‚Äôs Vision The COSMOSDYDX token is integral to the dYdX protocol, a powerful decentralized exchange built on the Cosmos SDK. This transition to a standalone blockchain offers dYdX greater scalability and control over its network. The token itself plays a crucial role in governance, allowing holders to participate in decisions regarding the protocol‚Äôs future. This transition and the token‚Äôs utility are key reasons why it‚Äôs gaining attention, especially with the potential for Coinbase dYdX integration. The dYdX platform enables users to trade perpetual contracts without intermediaries, offering a truly decentralized trading experience. Its innovative approach to derivatives trading has positioned it as a leader in the DeFi space. Why Are New Crypto Listings on Coinbase So Important? The announcement of new crypto listings on major exchanges like Coinbase often generates significant market excitement.

2025-08-05 18:55:10,49596357,1754420110,Revolutionary USDSL Stablecoin Launched by Slash: Transforming Global Payments,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary USDSL Stablecoin Launched by Slash: Transforming Global Payments U.S. neobank Slash has introduced a significant advancement in global finance: the USDSL stablecoin . This new digital currency, backed by the U.S. dollar and issued through Stripe‚Äôs Bridge, promises to redefine how businesses handle international transactions. Imagine a world where cross-border payments are not only faster but also significantly cheaper. Slash is making this vision a reality with its innovative solution, addressing long-standing pain points in the global payment landscape. What is the USDSL Stablecoin and How Does It Work? The USDSL stablecoin is essentially a digital representation of the U.S. dollar on a blockchain. This means its value is pegged 1:1 to the USD, offering stability that volatile cryptocurrencies often lack. Unlike traditional bank transfers that can take days, especially across borders, stablecoins facilitate near-instant settlements. Here‚Äôs how it simplifies things: USD-Backed Stability: Each USDSL token is backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, ensuring its value remains consistent. Blockchain Efficiency: Transactions occur on a blockchain, providing transparency and speed. Reduced Intermediaries: Fewer banks and intermediaries mean lower fees and faster processing. This innovation is particularly impactful for businesses dealing with international suppliers or customers. Why is Slash USDSL a Game-Changer for Global Business Payments? The traditional system for global business payments is often slow, expensive, and complex. Businesses frequently face delays, high foreign exchange (FX) fees, and opaque settlement processes. Slash‚Äôs USDSL stablecoin directly tackles these issues head-on, offering a compelling alternative. Consider these key benefits: Dramatic Speed Increase: Settlement times can be reduced from days to mere minutes or seconds, improving cash flow for businesses. Significant Cost Savings: By minimizing or eliminating FX fees and reducing reliance on costly SWIFT transfers, businesses save money. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain transactions provide an immutable record, offering clear visibility into payment flows. Global Accessibility: Businesses can transact with partners worldwide without the usual banking hurdles. This move by Slash is poised to transform how companies manage their international finances. The Role of Stripe Bridge in This Crypto Payment Innovation A crucial element enabling this launch is Stripe‚Äôs Bridge, which acts as the issuer for the Slash USDSL stablecoin. Stripe, a giant in online payment processing, bringing its infrastructure and trust to the stablecoin space, signals a major endorsement for digital currencies in mainstream finance. Stripe Bridge likely handles the on-ramping and off-ramping of fiat currency to USDSL, ensuring the peg‚Äôs integrity and providing the necessary regulatory compliance framework. This partnership between Slash and Stripe is a powerful example of how established financial technology companies are embracing crypto payment innovation to solve real-world problems. Their collaboration helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging digital asset economy. Navigating Stablecoin Regulation: The GENIUS Act‚Äôs Impact The launch of USDSL comes at a pivotal time for stablecoin regulation US . The recent passage of the GENIUS Act is a significant development, providing a clearer regulatory framework for U.S. stablecoin issuers. This legislation aims to bring more certainty and consumer protection to the stablecoin market, fostering responsible growth. For companies like Slash, a defined regulatory environment is crucial. It provides the legal clarity needed to operate confidently and scale their offerings. This regulatory backing helps instill greater trust among businesses and institutions considering stablecoins for their operations. The GENIUS Act helps pave the way for broader adoption of compliant stablecoins like USDSL. The introduction of the USDSL stablecoin by Slash, powered by Stripe‚Äôs Bridge, marks a pivotal moment for global business payments. By offering a faster, cheaper, and more transparent alternative to traditional methods, Slash is empowering businesses to operate more efficiently on a global scale. Coupled with evolving regulatory clarity, this innovation highlights the growing maturity and practical application of stablecoins in the real economy. It‚Äôs an exciting step towards a more interconnected and streamlined financial future for businesses worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary benefit of using USDSL stablecoin for businesses? A1: The primary benefit is significantly reduced settlement times and lower foreign exchange (FX) fees for international business payments, leading to improved cash flow and cost savings. Q2: How does USDSL maintain its stable value? A2: USDSL maintains its stable value by being fully backed 1:1 with U.S. dollars, ensuring that each digital token represents an equivalent amount of fiat currency. Q3: What is Stripe‚Äôs Bridge‚Äôs role in the USDSL launch? A3: Stripe‚Äôs Bridge acts as the issuer for the USDSL stablecoin, leveraging Stripe‚Äôs established infrastructure to facilitate the on-ramping and off-ramping of funds and ensure regulatory compliance. Q4: How does the GENIUS Act affect stablecoins like USDSL? A4: The GENIUS Act provides a clearer regulatory framework for U.S. stablecoin issuers, offering legal certainty, fostering responsible growth, and increasing trust among users and institutions. Q5: Can any business use USDSL for international payments? A5: While designed for global business payments, specific eligibility may depend on Slash‚Äôs service availability and compliance requirements in different jurisdictions. Businesses interested should consult Slash directly. Q6: Is USDSL a volatile cryptocurrency? A6: No, USDSL is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to the U.S. dollar to minimize price volatility, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

2025-08-05 18:50:39,49596881,1754419839,Brazil to hold a public hearing on August 20 to discuss creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"The first official Brazilian debate on whether a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve should be established will be held on August 20, 2025. This hearing will be held in the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia‚Äôs capital. It will address Bill 4.501/2024, which suggests the addition of Bitcoin to the national reserve, which will be under state jurisdiction. ‚ÄúRequests the holding of a public hearing with the objective of debating PL 4501/2024, which provides for the formation of a Sovereign Strategic Reserve of Bitcoins by the Federal Government and provides other measures.‚Äù Federal deputy Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragan√ßa The proposal was first introduced by Deputy Eros Biondini in November 2024 and was subsequently posted to the Economic Development Commission. Deputy Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Braganca had called the hearing publicly later in June, and this is now to be met by the scheduled session on August 20. The bill demands that the Brazilian Treasury begin diversifying its asset holdings by purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptoassets that are considered secure. The event will be open to experts and the public, giving key figures a platform to present their views on the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin in government reserves. Brazil, the ninth-biggest economy in the world, has a foreign exchange reserve of nearly $341 billion. If this bill is passed, 5% of these reserves, or $17 billion, will be channeled into Bitcoin. This would make Brazil the world‚Äôs largest holder of Bitcoin reserves, replacing countries such as El Salvador, the U.K., and Bhutan. Brazil‚Äôs move to discuss Bitcoin integration aligns with its growing commitment to digital assets. In June 2023, the country implemented a legal framework that empowers its central bank to regulate and oversee virtual asset service providers. The new framework also clarifies the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs authority over tokens considered securities. Brazil‚Äôs growing crypto landscape The Brazilian crypto environment is already robust. The country became a leader in the Americas in authorizing spot cryptocurrency ETFs. Brazil currently has a variety of investment options within the cryptocurrency industry. These are FOMO11, which measures sentiment on the market; DEFI11, which combines a selection of DeFi tokens; and HASH11, the most traded ETF in Brazil. Also, a Solana spot ETF was authorized in August 2024, boosting Brazil to an even higher standing. The next steps of the Brazilian Bitcoin Reserve will rely upon the conclusion of the open hearing on August 20. If the Economic Development Commission passes the bill, it will then be passed to Congress and can eventually be signed by the President. Global Bitcoin Reserve adoption Brazil is not alone in considering a national Bitcoin reserve. Several other nations have also moved to integrate Bitcoin into their financial frameworks. The ongoing discussions come at a time when other nations are also looking into similar plans. An example is the United States, which has been considering the formation of a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, as recent remarks by Bo Hines, Digital Assets Director of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, have suggested. Similar to Brazil, the U.S. has to balance regulatory issues with the possible financial advantages of Bitcoin as a part of reserves. In 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to make Bitcoin a legal tender. The government is also reported to have earned tremendously through Bitcoin possession, and it has not stopped its daily routine of buying one Bitcoin each day.

2025-08-05 18:39:00,49596445,1754419140,"4 Cryptos That Could Soar 30x and Turn $1,500 into $45,000 Copying Solana‚Äôs (SOL) 2021 Success","Dreaming of Solana‚Äôs explosive 2021 growth, many investors have their eyes on four untapped tokens‚ÄîLittle Pepe (LILPEPE), Arbitrum (ARB), Tron (TRX), Ethena (ENA)‚Äîthat have plenty of utility, strong communities, and notable price movement. These tokens present an opportunity to grow a mere $1,500 investment into over $45,000 if Solana‚Äôs trajectory is followed during the next market-wide bull cycle. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme infra meets explosive presale upside Little Pepe is trading at Stage 9 of its presale at around $0.0018. Meme tokens have an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 blockchain optimized for meme tokens. This unique bet meme space infrastructure has zero tax trading, instant finality, and anti-sniper protection. At the center of the project is a Meme `Launchpad` that incubates new tokens in its ecosystem titled ‚ÄúPepe Pump Pad.‚Äù This adds utility beyond mere speculation. Should it take the same route as Solana‚Äîthrough presale access, viral momentum, and subsequent exchange listings‚Äîanalysts predict it could reach a price of anywhere between $0.10 and $0.30+, meaning 3,000‚Äì5,000% gains from its current figure. However, this goes beyond mere statistics; this is about the Legend of Little Pepe. The Legend depicts the story of a baby frog whose destiny is to create a meme-fueled empire on the remains of Ethereum. The roadmap is highly ambitious, and the phases named ‚ÄúPregnancy,‚Äù ‚ÄúBirth,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrowth‚Äù are downright memetastic, promising a $1 billion market cap and a Top 100 ranking on CoinMarketCap. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum scaling token with long‚Äëterm DeFi utility Arbitrum (ARB) is now priced at approximately $0.41 and has a market cap of $2.14 billion. As Ethereum is one of the leadingLayer-2r ‚Äì 2 networks, Arbitrum facilitates fast finality and low fee throughput for DeFi, gaming, and staking activities. Its ecosystem includes the DRIP yield program and active developer grants, which position Arbitrum as one of Ethereum‚Äôs scalable backbones. As more people use Arbitrum, which accrues value from transaction volume, it is primed for growth alongside the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. DeFi expansions may lead to multifold growth. Bullish analysts predict the price to reach $1.50-$2, which means 3x to 4x returns. This is certainly possible during an altcoin surge similar to what SOL experienced. Tron (TRX): High-throughput network with emerging DeFi leverage TRON (TRX) is trading at roughly $0.33 and has a market capitalization of nearly $31 billion. TRON is designed for quick, on-the-go decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin transactions. TRX has advantages in areas like Asia, which are capitalized on by its staking utility and connections to USDD/USDT payment systems. TRX keeps working on new DeFi solutions, forming new partnerships, and gaining adoption in different regions. Even though it is less developed than meme tokens, TRX is actively making new developments. Analysts project a 3 to 5X price increase in 2025 with additional network activity and rising staking yields. That makes TRX a reliable mid-cap investment with solid growth opportunities. Ethena (ENA): Yield-bearing dollar protocol with profound financial logic Ethena is currently priced at approximately $0.57 per token. With a market cap of around $3.7 billion and a circulating supply of 6.35 billion ENA tokens, Ethena is quite significant. Ethena serves as the governance token for the USDe synthetic dollar protocol, enabling users to yield generation through a basis trade model comprising long spot and short futures, thus offering a crypto-native savings instrument. Ethena differs from the viral meme play in that its utility and use case value parallels Solana‚Äôs earlier growth: simple staking, revenue arbitrage for its holders, and increasing demand for synthetic dollar exposure. If ENA‚Äôs yield-bearing ecosystem expands, and USDe‚Äôs utility rises, ENA could yield 5- 10x returns by the end of the year. Conclusion Like SOL‚Äôs epic rise in 2021, all four of these tokens can potentially deliver outsized returns. Little Pepe provides the opportunity with the most extreme speculation, and is undoubtedly a more risky option. Arbitrum provides a scalable DeFi utility with strong long-term potential. Tron balances mainstream adoption with staking alongside a more regional focus. Ethena applies financial engineering and yield mechanics to the tokenomics mix. With a diversified $1,500 investment ‚Äì sharpening $500 into each ‚Äì if all four appreciate along historical breakout trajectories, it could reach a target of $45,000. It combines meme-inspired potential, layered utility, meme-centric appeal, and a financial infrastructural ecosystem, thus constructing a portfolio template for 2025.

2025-08-05 18:38:56,49595755,1754419136,Announcing 8 new margin and futures collateral currencies on Kraken Pro,"We‚Äôre committed to providing traders with greater flexibility and control, and are excited to announce a significant expansion in our collateral opportunities for Kraken Pro traders. With this update, the number of collateral currencies you can use for margin and derivatives trading has increased to 52. Start trading on Kraken Pro What is a collateral currency? A collateral currency can be fiat, crypto or stablecoin you can use for trading on margin. Unlike standard spot trading, margin trading allows you to open long or short positions by borrowing funds directly from Kraken. When you trade on margin, Kraken‚Äôs margin pool is used for the purchase or sale of the cryptocurrency, while your collateral secures the extensions of margin. The collateral currency you use does not need to match the trading pair of the order book you‚Äôre trading on, allowing for greater flexibility to go long or short in any margin enabled trading pair . Note: Both unstaked and Kraken Rewards assets can be used as margin collateral. However, assets held in Kraken Pro on-chain staking are ineligible to use as margin collateral. Maximizing the benefits of margin trading Expanding the range of collateral currencies may empower s traders in several ways: Tax advantages In some jurisdictions, using digital assets as collateral rather than selling them outright can defer taxable events. By leveraging collateral currencies for margin trading, traders can potentially reduce immediate tax liabilities while maintaining exposure to their holdings. Diversification of collateral By using multiple collateral currencies, you can better manage risk and reduce exposure to volatility in any single asset. This is particularly valuable for traders seeking to safeguard their positions in unpredictable markets. Improved liquidity With more assets eligible as collateral, you can free up funds for other trading opportunities while maintaining robust positions on margin. This ensures your portfolio remains active and responsive to market changes. Strategic flexibility The ability to combine assets with different haircuts enables fine-tuned margin strategies tailored to your risk tolerance and market outlook. Whether you prefer conservative or aggressive trading, expanded collateral options provide the adaptability you need. Hedging and short selling opportunities With access to margin trading and a diverse range of collateral currencies, traders can hedge their existing positions or take advantage of downward market movements through short selling. This opens up opportunities for profit regardless of market direction. Leverage and capital efficiency Margin trading can amplify your buying power, allowing you to take larger positions than your available capital. This capital efficiency is further enhanced by the ability to use a broader range of collateral currencies, enabling you to maximize potential returns while optimizing resource allocation. New collateral currencies Here‚Äôs the list of the 8 new assets being added to Kraken‚Äôs margin collateral lineup, bringing the total to 52 options . Asset Haircut SPX6900 (SPX) 20% Algorand (ALGO) 10% Ondo (ONDO) 10% Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) 20% Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) 10% Unisawl (UNI) 10% Curve DAO Token (CRV) 10% Ethena (ENA) 10% Understanding haircuts When using a currency as collateral, Kraken applies a ‚Äúhaircut‚Äù to determine its effective value. This haircut reflects the percentage reduction applied to the asset‚Äôs value to account for potential price volatility. For example, if you hold $1,000 worth of an asset with a 20% haircut, its collateral value is calculated at $800. This approach ensures greater stability and reduces the risk associated with using volatile assets as margin collateral. What to keep in mind It‚Äôs important to note that collateral assets used to open margin positions cannot be exchanged for other currencies or withdrawn while the position is open. These assets remain reserved as collateral and are visible in your account balance, but they are restricted from trading or withdrawals. You can check the availability of your collateral assets at any time through the Funding tab in your Kraken account. Ready to trade but don‚Äôt have a Kraken account yet?

The force has applied a crypto wallet freezing order under the Proceeds of Crime Act for the first time. The victim was repaid in full, and surplus funds will be directed toward crime prevention through a national innovation fund. Lancashire Police will receive ¬£500,000 to reinvest in crime prevention after securing a forfeiture order on Bitcoin linked to a 2017 fraud case, according to a statement published by the authority. The investigation began when officers received a report of stolen funds later traced to Bitcoin conversions by offenders from Blackpool, Fleetwood, and Blackburn. Those involved were prosecuted and sentenced, while the Bitcoin‚Äôs value increased beyond the original stolen amount. Police get ¬£500,000 windfall from seized Bitcoin https://t.co/RvLS59rPbY ‚Äî BBC Lancashire (@BBCLancashire) August 5, 2025 First Use of Crypto Wallet Freezing Powers In a first for the force, a crypto wallet freezing order was applied under the Proceeds of Crime Act, allowing the assets to be seized. The victim was fully compensated, and with the law prohibiting overpayment, a ¬£1 million surplus remained. A judge approved its forfeiture, directing the proceeds to be split between the Home Office and Lancashire Police. Half of the funds, ¬£500,000, will be allocated to the Prevention and Problem-Solving Innovation Fund within the coming months. Detective Sergeant David Wainwright of the Economic Crime Unit said, ‚ÄúThis is a great result for the people of Lancashire, and hopefully the first of many future uses of this new legislation.‚Äù Funds to Support Local Safety Initiatives in the UK The fund prioritizes community projects, crime prevention programs, and law enforcement tools. Previous allocations have included drones for surveillance, spam-call-blocking devices, and initiatives approved by the Antisocial Behaviour Prevention team. Wainwright noted that while it was unusual for criminal property to appreciate beyond the original crime value, the outcome both compensated the victim and created resources to reduce future offenses. By reinvesting seized crypto assets , Lancashire Police seek to disrupt criminal financial gains while strengthening public safety efforts across the county. Cryptocurrency is increasingly being addressed in financial crime enforcement, not only in seizure but also in post-recovery management. Police departments are beginning to handle digital assets through legal and administrative processes similar to those used for physical property. In the UK , as discussions continue around a formal digital asset framework, cases involving crypto recovery may influence how local forces approach asset tracing, evidence handling, and redistribution of funds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might this case affect future fraud investigations involving cryptocurrency? It could encourage wider use of wallet freezing orders and expand training for officers on tracing digital asset flows. What challenges do police face when valuing seized cryptocurrency? Volatility makes asset valuation complex. Authorities must often secure court approval quickly to manage the risk of large price swings. Could crypto forfeitures change how police forces budget for technology? Yes. Consistent inflows from such cases could allow forces to self‚Äëfund advanced digital crime‚Äëfighting tools without relying solely on central budgets.

2025-08-05 18:37:07,49595695,1754419027,End-of-July Bitcoin Dip Explained: What Triggered It? (CryptoQuant),"The hottest month of the year also saw some of the hottest climbs for the largest digital asset, which reached unseen territories driven by global demand. The market is naturally cooling after a month of events, and speculation about the next direction is high. Here‚Äôs CryptoQuant‚Äôs take on why BTC dipped at the end of July. Potential Triggers The month of July, which marked the second half of the year, saw a spectacular BTC run that drove the asset to a new all-time high of just over $123,000. At the end of the month, however, bitcoin experienced a significant drop, losing 7-8% of its value and falling to a multi-week low of $112,000. Given that this ATH was a level not previously seen, it was natural for some profit-taking to occur, whether by institutions, investors, miners, or OG holders who decided to exit at this price range. A notable sell-off took place in the last few days of the month. Galaxy Digital disposed of 80,000 BTC for a client, valued at around $9 billion. While it was a strong month for BTC Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with only 4 days marking outflows, anything that goes up must come down, right? On July 31st and August 1st, over $920 million left ETFs, according to data from SoSoValue. The following graph, shared by CryptoQuant, is a good visualization of the sharp decline. Source: CryptoQuant ‚ÄúETF inflows were intermittent and not stable during periods when funds were withdrawn from ETFs. There was no alternative demand to compensate for this shortfall,‚Äù was noted by the blockchain page ArabxChain. The macroeconomic scene also did not help much, with the most recent Federal Reserve meeting from last week, despite the US economy posting a 3% increase. President Trump used this opportunity to urge Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates, but they remained unchanged. Future Outlook The crypto asset with the largest market capitalization experienced a few wobbly days and appears to be still recovering from them, with overall market santiment split between bearish and bullish. The most recent liquidation heatmap from Coinglass indicates strong investor confidence that Bitcoin will regain its previous levels, with a significant cluster of positions centered around the $120,000 mark. Source: Coinglass Micha√´l van de Poppe¬†noted on X that ‚ÄúBitcoin is doing great,‚Äù but also emphasized the possibility that BTC is not entirely out of the woods yet. ‚ÄúRejection here? Yes, that would mean we‚Äôre retesting the area around $110-112K.‚Äù The author and advocate of BTC, Robert Kiyosaki, is still leaning toward a more bearish stance, citing historically low August levels. Although he will not shy away from buying the dip, should it happen. The post End-of-July Bitcoin Dip Explained: What Triggered It?

2025-08-05 18:34:11,49596808,1754418851,Coinbase to Raise $2B as Revenue and Share Price Falls,"Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the U.S., is looking to raise capital to improve its finances. The move comes after the company reported lower revenue in the second quarter and saw its stock fall by 15%. The company, which recently released an unusual campaign , now plans to raise $2 billion by offering special bonds that can later be turned into shares. This aims to boost its balance sheet and prepare for future growth. Coinbase Announces Convertible Notes Offering On August 5, Coinbase revealed its intention to raise $2 billion through a private sale of convertible senior notes , a common practice in the crypto industry. These notes will mature in two parts, with $1 billion due in 2029 and another $1 billion due in 2032. Investors will also have the option to buy an additional $300 million worth of notes across both series. As announced , these notes are only available to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A. They are unsecured and will pay interest twice a year. It can also be converted into cash, Coinbase Class A shares, or a mix of both, depending on what the company decides. Coinbase may also choose to redeem these notes early, based on certain terms. Final interest rates and conversion prices will be set at the time of pricing. Plans to Limit Share Dilution with Capped Calls Coinbase, with an over $100 billion market cap, plans to enter into capped call transactions to reduce the impact of dilution from this fundraising effort. These will help limit the number of new shares created if the notes are converted. This approach can also offset cash payments if the share price rises above a set threshold. The banks or firms involved in these transactions may also trade Coinbase stock and related products to manage their risk. Furthermore, the exchange said it will use part of the money to pay for capped call deals, which help limit how many new shares are made later. The rest will be used for general business needs or to pay off some of the company‚Äôs debt. Potential targets for repurchase include various convertible and senior notes due between 2026 and 2031. Earnings Decline Pushes Stock Down Just days before the announcement, Coinbase released its second-quarter earnings, showing a decline in revenue and a rise in expenses. This news caused COIN shares to fall by 15% on August 4. Initially, the stock was trading at $308, down over 2% from the previous close. Despite the weaker quarter, some analysts remain optimistic. Along with its funding plans, Coinbase is also buying more Bitcoin (BTC). In the second quarter, it bought 2,509 BTC, worth about $222 million at the time. This brings its total to 11,776 BTC, putting it back in the top 10 among public companies holding Bitcoin, just ahead of Tesla.

2025-08-05 18:30:17,49596036,1754418617,"U.S. government has picked OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to provide AI tools to federal agencies","The U.S. government has officially designated OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic as approved artificial intelligence (AI) vendors, paving the way for easier adoption of their tools across federal agencies. U.S. Announced by the General Services Administration (GSA), the move is part of a broader push by the U.S. to accelerate the responsible use of AI in civilian government operations. The companies‚Äîcreators of ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude‚Äîare now available through the GSA‚Äôs Multiple Award Schedule, a contracting mechanism that offers pre-negotiated pricing and terms. Previously, agencies had to go through time-consuming legal and procurement processes to acquire AI tools. The GSA has effectively removed much of that red tape by adding these three firms to its schedule. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in the position of picking winners or losers here. We want the maximum number of tools to provide to all federal government employees to make them as productive as possible,‚Äù said GSA Deputy Administrator¬†Stephen Ehikian. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be different tools for different use cases.‚Äù Though specific contract values remain undisclosed, the GSA is known for securing deep discounts through bulk purchasing‚Äîsimilar to past deals with Adobe, Salesforce, and Google. The selected AI models underwent GSA vetting for safety, performance, and security. Officials added that more AI vendors may be approved soon, pending completion of the evaluation process. Federal agencies prepare for widespread AI integration The U.S. government‚Äôs decision to approve OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic as official AI vendors marks a turning point in how federal agencies adopt and integrate artificial intelligence into their operations. For example, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) plans to use AI to develop customer service chatbots and analyze public comments on federal regulations. OPM Director Scott Kupor noted that manually summarizing tens of thousands of citizen responses often delays the regulatory process, but said that with AI, the agency could work faster and more accurately. Other departments like the Treasury and the Department of Commerce are exploring AI to help detect tax fraud , process patents, and support grant application reviews. Until now, many of these tools were limited to small-scale pilot projects, often siloed within national security or research-focused initiatives. The GSA‚Äôs new approval opens the door for agency-wide and cross-agency adoption. The Pentagon has already been ahead of the curve, issuing contracts to OpenAI and Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI for military-related projects. Those deals are separate from the GSA program but signal a federal consensus: AI is now a core component of U.S. government strategy. White House sets new standards to curb AI bias The GSA‚Äôs announcement follows a recent push from U.S. President Donald Trump to reshape federal AI policy . Just days before the vendor list was released, Trump signed three executive orders to tighten government AI use oversight. This rule suggests that it will be implemented at the agency level, with each department deciding what bias is and how they imagine they can test for it. Trump and other conservative leaders have regularly referred to bias as the ‚Äúwoke AI‚Äù problem. The effort goes beyond simply processing new technology, said Josh Gruenbaum , Commissioner of the GSA‚Äôs Federal Acquisition Service. He called it winning the global race in artificial intelligence, the same thing the president said when he declared that ‚Äúthe U.S. must win.‚Äù Still, the inclusion of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, companies often accused by conservatives of holding liberal biases, suggests the government focuses more on utility and performance than ideology, at least in the early stages. The GSA noted that the agency‚Äôs vetting process included bias assessments, security checks, and performance evaluations, and added that more tools would be added as they meet the required standards.

2025-08-05 18:30:00,49596034,1754418600,Dogecoin Aims to Reclaim $80B ATH Market Cap as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Emerges as the Top Altcoin to Buy Now,"As Dogecoin sets its sights on reclaiming its historic $80 billion all-time high (ATH) market cap, investors and analysts alike are casting their gaze toward the fast-rising DeFi player. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving out a unique niche with its lending protocol. Mutuum Finance is at Phase 6 and is present at $0.035. The next price increase will take LILPEPE to $0.04 in phase 7. Presale investors who invest in this phase will receive a return on investment of 71.43% when the token goes live at $0.06. MUTM presale has achieved more than $14 million raised and onboarded more than 14,800 unique holders. With market sentiment shifting and altcoins jockeying for position in the next leg of the bull run, MUTM‚Äôs strong early momentum is positioning it as a potential disruptor among more established tokens. Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes Recovery Around $0.20 Amid Market Rotation Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.24 fluctuating within that range, with a market cap near $30‚Äì36‚ÄØbillion. While DOGE recently reclaimed support above $0.19, technical momentum remains modest alongside declining social sentiment and flat volume trends. Resistance near $$0.25 may cap short-term upside. As veteran meme tokens like DOGE hold steady, investor attention is increasingly shifting toward emerging protocol-based DeFi plays such as Mutuum Finance. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance has recently ended its Phase 5 presale and moved to Phase 6, where its tokens are on sale at a price of $0.035. The next price adjustment will be an additional 14.29% increase to push the token price to $0.04. Early investors will enjoy a 71.43% ROI once the token rises to $0.06. The presale for MUTM has already raised more than $14 million and attracted more than 14,800 individual holders. Mutuum Finance Partners with CertiK to Launch $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a Bug Bounty Program. The program‚Äôs reward pool is $50,000 USDT. Four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded. The program depicts the vision of Mutuum Finance to build community-driven, safe and sustainable ecosystem.

Can It Push Further?,"Pump.fun‚Äôs $PUMP token gained 5.5% to $0.003154 as whale activity and buybacks countered a 67% post-launch crash and a billion-dollar lawsuit threat. Behind the price movement, conflicting forces are at work. While venture firms accumulate tokens and derivatives activity grows, the platform battles legal challenges, and rivals are gaining market share. Source: CoinGecko Pump.fun Faces Legal Heat and Competition But Indicates Recovery as Ecosystem Evolves Launched through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on July 12, 2025, Pump.fun sold 15% of its total 1 trillion token supply , amounting to 150 billion PUMP tokens. The token sale drew considerable attention and indicated the platform‚Äôs ambition to be more than just a memecoin incubator. Shortly after its debut, $PUMP plummeted 67% from its peak. This decline has put pressure on the platform to innovate and reinforce its value proposition to the market. To restore confidence, the project initiated its buyback program, where it repurchased $31.3 million worth of $PUMP tokens funded by 25% of the protocol revenue. Pump.fun also acquired Kolscan, a leading on-chain wallet tracking tool, to improve transparency and attract serious meme investors. we‚Äôre excited to announce that pump fun has acquired @kolscan Kolscan is a wallet tracker that monitors the activities of top onchain traders. it provides realtime transactions, token PnL, and a leaderboard ranking their performance our integration will not only enable better‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/V4VDcOwVeG ‚Äî pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) July 10, 2025 Yet, just as the project sought stability, a class-action lawsuit was filed by Burwick Law, claiming Pump.fun operates like an ‚Äúillegal casino‚Äù that encourages speculative memecoin gambling. The lawsuit seeks $5.5 billion in damages, a massive legal challenge that could impact the platform‚Äôs long-term regulatory standing and public perception. Pumpdotfun Litigation Update Burwick Law, on behalf of plaintiffs, filed a new complaint in federal court in the Southern District of New York alleging RICO claims against Anatoly Yakavenko, Raj Gokal, Dan Albert, Lily Liu, Austin Federa, Solana Labs, Solana Foundation, Alon‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) July 23, 2025 Despite the setbacks, Pump.fun is fighting back. The asset saw an 11% growth in price on the back of bullish fundamentals and aggressive whale accumulation. According to on-chain activity, venture firm GSR purchased $4.6 million worth of PUMP from exchanges, indicating institutional interest. At the same time, open interest in PUMP derivatives rose 6%, hitting $743 million, while the funding rate flipped positive. But competition is heating up in the meme launchpad space. Rivals like LetsBonk.fun are gaining ground rapidly, forcing Pump.fun to double up on its buyback strategy, acquisitions, and product rollout. $PUMP Pulls Back After Hitting Measured Target With Triple Bottom Breakout Earlier today, $PUMP/USDT pulled back from its intraday high near $0.00338 after a clean breakout from a well-formed triple bottom pattern on the 1H chart. The pattern had formed starting from late July into early August, with well defined reaction lows and an ascending neckline. After the third bottom near $0.00260, we saw $PUMP break out with strength, tapping the projected upside target around $0.00336 before losing steam. $PUMP/USDT price chart, August 5 (Source: TradingView) The traded volume increased steadily during the breakout leg, confirming participation behind the move. However, the latest session reveals a shift. Volume footprint data shows that although total volume remained high across most of the session, particularly between 08:00 and 10:00 UTC, where 16.65B were traded, the delta has turned less favorable. In addition, a large red delta candle printed after the high, with over -53.4M delta on 7.84B total volume. That shift reflects aggressive selling into local strength. Earlier in the move, between 06:00 and 09:00 UTC, the delta skewed heavily bullish, with back-to-back prints over +1.19B, +1.35B, and +1.31B. These coincided with the main thrust out of the base. But since tapping the projected target, price action has flattened, and the most recent deltas show mild selling with less follow-through from buyers. Right now, $PUMP is holding above $0.00304, which is a good enough short-term level to watch. If that gives way, the next support sits around $0.00295. On the upside, reclaiming $0.00320 with strong volume could put bulls back in control. But for now, this looks like a classic case of a pattern that hit its target and is taking a moment to reset.

With the crypto spotlight swinging back to community-driven tokens, the market is buzzing once again. In this frenzy, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is lighting up discussions with a powerful presale surge and head-turning features. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu holds its ground with an impressive 24-hour volume, and Fartcoin‚Äôs price breakout is adding fire to meme coin conversations. But in the middle of these movers, Arctic Pablo Coin is climbing with unmatched momentum‚Äîand the presale is inching toward its final stages. Acting late might mean entering too high. Are you really willing to risk watching another coin 10x without you? This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Fartcoin. Battle for the Blockchain Spotlight: Community Challenges Spark Buzz One of the most exciting features of Arctic Pablo Coin is its Community Competitions, where users can earn APC tokens or even USD rewards by participating in engaging tasks. But here‚Äôs what makes it different‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just some referral system in disguise. It‚Äôs a gamified, reward-based model that drives true community engagement and growth. Think about it: what other project gives real-world value just for showing off your meme skills or sharing a tweet? Whether you‚Äôre a digital artist, trader, or content wizard, these competitions make Arctic Pablo Coin a platform to earn while you engage. Could this be the crypto that finally merges fun with function? Many believe it‚Äôs more than just a token‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. And as Arctic Pablo shines among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now , early backers are already reaping the rewards. How many projects reward you before launch? That‚Äôs the kind of question APC answers daily. $3.23M Raised and Climbing: Just One More Stage Before Arctic Pablo‚Äôs Price Launches The meme coin presale momentum around Arctic Pablo Coin is electrifying. The project has now hit Stage 35 (Firefrost Flats) with a price of just $0.00071 per APC. Over $3.23 million has been raised‚Äîan unmistakable signal of investor trust and growing excitement.

2025-08-05 18:12:13,49594741,1754417533,SEC Says Liquid Staking and Receipt Tokens May Not Be Securities Under Certain Structures,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance published a detailed statement on Tuesday clarifying its views on ‚Äúliquid staking,‚Äù a type of crypto protocol staking where users receive newly minted tokens representing staked assets. In a statement, the SEC said the guidance seeks to help crypto participants understand whether these arrangements fall under U.S. securities laws. BREAKING from @SECGov : Liquid staking activities and tokens are not considered securities pic.twitter.com/POcFywU6X7 ‚Äî Solana (@solana) August 5, 2025 According to the Division, under specific conditions, liquid staking activities and the associated receipt tokens do not involve the offer or sale of securities and therefore do not require SEC registration. Understanding Liquid Staking and Receipt Tokens In a liquid staking setup, crypto holders deposit their assets with a third-party or protocol-based provider and receive ‚Äústaking receipt tokens‚Äù in return. These tokens serve as proof of ownership for the deposited crypto and any rewards earned through staking. Unlike traditional staking, liquid staking allows users to retain liquidity‚Äîthe receipt tokens can be used in other crypto applications or redeemed later, subject to protocol conditions such as ‚Äúunbonding‚Äù periods. These arrangements can be facilitated either programmatically through self-executing code (protocol-based) or via custodians who manage wallets and interact with staking protocols on behalf of users. In either case, users maintain ownership of their deposited assets throughout the staking process. SEC‚Äôs Position: No Securities Involved in Liquid Staking The SEC‚Äôs Division explains that the actions undertaken in these liquid staking arrangements‚Äîincluding the minting, issuing, and redeeming of staking receipt tokens‚Äîdo not meet the legal definition of a securities offering, as long as the deposited assets themselves are not securities or part of an investment contract. This determination hinges on the absence of entrepreneurial or managerial efforts by the Liquid Staking Provider. Providers are not seen as actively managing the user‚Äôs investment but merely performing administrative or ministerial functions such as staking the assets or selecting node operators. Therefore, the economic benefits to users arise directly from the staking activity itself, not from the provider‚Äôs business efforts‚Äîa key distinction under the Howey Test used to identify investment contracts. Howey Test Analysis and the Role of the Provider The SEC applies the Howey Test to evaluate whether an arrangement constitutes an investment contract. The test looks for three elements: an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. In the case of liquid staking, the Division stresses that the provider‚Äôs role is limited to technical facilitation rather than strategic decision-making. Receipt Tokens Are Not Securities The SEC also addressed the nature of staking receipt tokens themselves. While they are receipts that confirm ownership of deposited crypto, they are not receipts for securities unless the underlying assets qualify as such. These tokens do not independently generate rewards; instead, their value reflects the performance of the staked assets. As long as the structure avoids reliance on managerial efforts and adheres to the described protocols, the SEC does not consider these tokens to be part of a securities offering. The agency cautions, however, that any deviation from these parameters‚Äîparticularly where providers play a larger, more entrepreneurial role‚Äîcould change the regulatory outcome. This statement, therefore, offers a framework for compliance but not a blanket exemption. SEC Launches ‚ÄòProject Crypto‚Äô Initiative SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced the launch of ‚Äú Project Crypto ‚Äù on July 31, a comprehensive initiative designed to modernize securities regulations and allow America‚Äôs financial markets to move on-chain. I had a great discussion today about Project Crypto and the SEC‚Äôs strategy to bring crypto innovators and builders back to America with @yahoofinance ‚Äôs @jenniferisms .

2025-08-05 08:10:11,49570687,1754381411,Linea ETH Staking: Revolutionary Feature Arrives via Lido V3 Integration,"BitcoinWorld Linea ETH Staking: Revolutionary Feature Arrives via Lido V3 Integration The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is constantly evolving, and a significant new development is on the horizon for users of Linea, the innovative Ethereum Layer-2 network incubated by Consensys. Soon, you will be able to engage in Linea ETH staking directly through the network, leveraging the power of Lido v3 for enhanced capital efficiency. This integration promises to transform how users interact with their bridged ETH, opening up exciting new possibilities for passive income and liquidity. What is Linea ETH Staking and How Does It Work? Linea, a prominent Layer-2 solution built on Ethereum, is set to introduce a groundbreaking feature within a few months. This new functionality will enable ETH that users bridge to Linea to be automatically staked on the Ethereum mainnet. The mechanism utilizes Lido liquid staking , specifically through its v3 protocol. When you bridge your ETH to Linea, the network will facilitate its transfer to the Ethereum mainnet for staking. In return, you will receive stETH, Lido‚Äôs liquid staking token, on the Linea network. This means your staked ETH remains liquid, allowing you to use your stETH in other DeFi protocols on Linea while still earning staking rewards. This seamless process simplifies participation in Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus, making it more accessible for a wider range of users on the Consensys Linea network . Why is Liquid Staking on Linea a Game Changer for Users? The introduction of Linea ETH staking through Lido v3 offers several compelling advantages, particularly for those looking to maximize their digital assets. It addresses a key challenge in traditional staking: illiquidity. However, this new approach provides significant benefits. Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Your staked ETH remains liquid as stETH, allowing you to participate in other DeFi activities like lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity on Linea. Simplified User Experience: The automatic staking process removes much of the complexity typically associated with direct mainnet staking. Accessibility: By leveraging Linea‚Äôs Layer-2 architecture, users can potentially benefit from lower transaction fees compared to direct mainnet interactions, making staking more economical. This innovation significantly boosts the utility of ETH within the Linea ecosystem, paving the way for more dynamic DeFi opportunities . Consensys Linea Network: A Boost for DeFi Opportunities As an initiative from Consensys, a leading Ethereum software company, Linea brings significant credibility and technical prowess to the Layer-2 space. This upcoming staking feature is a testament to Linea‚Äôs commitment to enhancing user experience and expanding the utility of its network. Moreover, the integration with Lido v3, a well-established liquid staking provider, reinforces this commitment. This development is not just about staking; it is about creating a more vibrant and interconnected DeFi ecosystem. Users will gain more flexibility with their assets, which can drive further innovation and adoption within Linea‚Äôs decentralized applications. The ability to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity is a powerful incentive for both new and existing users to bridge their assets to the Consensys Linea network . Preparing for the Rollout: What Users Should Know About Linea ETH Staking While the official rollout is still a few months away, it is wise for interested users to prepare. Understanding the mechanics of liquid staking and the benefits of using an Ethereum Layer-2 for such operations will be crucial. Users should also stay informed about official announcements from Linea regarding the exact launch date and any specific requirements. Consider the following actionable insights: Security: Always ensure you are interacting with official Linea and Lido channels to avoid scams. Understanding stETH: Familiarize yourself with how stETH works and its potential peg fluctuations relative to ETH. Gas Fees: While Linea aims for lower fees, understand the costs associated with bridging ETH and interacting with DeFi protocols. This feature represents a significant step forward for Linea, enhancing its appeal as a robust platform for decentralized applications and financial services. Conclusion: A New Era for ETH Staking on Linea The upcoming launch of Linea ETH staking through Lido v3 marks a pivotal moment for the Linea network and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. By offering a seamless, efficient, and liquid staking solution, Linea is set to empower users with greater control and utility over their bridged ETH. This move underscores Linea‚Äôs position as an innovative Ethereum Layer-2 , committed to fostering a more accessible and capital-efficient DeFi landscape. As the rollout approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the positive impact this revolutionary feature will have on user engagement and the overall growth of the Linea ecosystem.

2025-08-05 08:00:51,49571022,1754380851,"India criticizes U.S., EU-Russia trade while facing Trump‚Äôs tariff pressure","India has called out the U.S. and European Union over their trade with Russia after President Trump threatened steeper tariffs on New Delhi. The country believes the Trump administration is targeting it over its imports of Russian oil. India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday that the country began importing its energy trade deal with Russia after the start of the war with Ukraine. The MEA also argued that its traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the war began, leading New Delhi to seek other alternatives for energy. India prioritizes economic security According to the ministry, the U.S. previously commended India‚Äôs oil trade initiative for strengthening global energy market stability. They also condemned the EU and the U.S. for criticizing New Delhi, yet they indulge in trade with Russia. The EU and Russia traded goods worth 67.5B euros last year, up from 17.2B euros the previous year. Official data also shows India‚Äôs trade with Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the 12 months to March 2025. The bloc accounted for 38.4% of Russia‚Äôs exports in 2024. Its bilateral trade with Russia also saw a 74% drop in 2024 from 275.5B euros in 2021. Moscow continues to export machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, iron and steel, and fertilizers to the EU. India and Russia only traded a mere $10.1 billion during the pre-pandemic trade. The figures indicate that New Delhi‚Äôs trade was much lower than the EU‚Äôs trade with Russia. The MEA condemned the U.S. for continued import of Russian Uranium, which it had banned in May 2024. The ministry noted that the Western country also imports palladium from Moscow to power its EV industry . The ministry highlighted that the targeting of the country is unjustified and unreasonable. India said it will take all necessary precautions to protect its national interests and economic security. Trump threatens higher tariffs on India Trump had called out India last week for continuing its energy trade with Russia and imposed 25% tariffs on the country, plus additional penalties. The President also threatened to raise levies for New Delhi on Monday, but didn‚Äôt specify the level of the higher tariffs. Trump said that India didn‚Äôt care about the deaths in Ukraine as they continue to buy massive amounts of Russian oil. His deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, reiterated on Sunday that it was not acceptable for India to continue financing the conflict in Ukraine by purchasing Russian energy. Trump has also accused India of purchasing cheap Russian oil and selling it on the Open Market for big profits. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that India went from importing 100,000 barrels per day before the conflict ‚Äì 2.5% of its total imports ‚Äì to more than 1.8 million barrels (39%) per day in 2023. ‚ÄúOur bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country. India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership.‚Äù -Randhir Jaiswal, Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs of India. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran called for the country to follow the example of China and Brazil to stand up to the Trump administration. He argued that the President‚Äôs exaggerated demands had turned political as well as economic, and could undermine India‚Äôs national interests. Get seen where it counts.

Recent reports from Bitcoin World market monitoring confirm a significant Bitcoin price drop , with BTC falling below the crucial $114,000 mark. Specifically, Bitcoin is currently trading at $113,996 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden BTC market dip has naturally sparked conversations and concerns among investors and enthusiasts alike. What does this mean for the broader crypto landscape, and how should we navigate such cryptocurrency volatility ? Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic nature, frequently experiences fluctuations. This latest Bitcoin price drop is a prime example of such movements. When a major asset like Bitcoin sees its value decrease, it often signals a broader sentiment shift across the digital asset space. While a single price point like $114,000 might seem arbitrary, breaking through significant psychological or technical support levels can amplify market reactions. Investors are closely watching to see if this is a temporary correction or the start of a more prolonged downturn. Understanding these immediate reactions is vital for informed decision-making. What Triggers a BTC Market Dip? Several factors can contribute to a sudden BTC market dip . Understanding these triggers is essential for any investor looking to make informed decisions. Here are some common influences: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, interest rate changes, or inflation reports can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. For example, rising interest rates might make traditional investments more appealing. Regulatory News: Announcements from governments or financial bodies regarding crypto regulations can have a profound impact. Positive news can boost prices, while restrictive measures can cause a dip, as seen with past regulatory crackdowns. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin (often called ‚Äòwhales‚Äô) can significantly influence the market. A large sell-off by a whale can trigger a cascade effect, creating selling pressure. Technical Analysis Indicators: Traders often use technical indicators. If key support levels are broken, it can trigger automatic sell orders, accelerating a price fall as more traders follow suit. Market Sentiment: News events, social media trends, or even widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can quickly shift market sentiment, leading to increased selling pressure. Navigating Cryptocurrency Volatility Cryptocurrency volatility is a defining characteristic of this asset class. While it presents risks, it also offers opportunities for savvy investors. It is crucial to remember that price swings are a normal part of the crypto journey. Rather than panicking during a Bitcoin price drop , consider these approaches: Long-Term Perspective: Many experienced investors advocate for a long-term view. Short-term dips might be less concerning if your investment horizon is several years, focusing on Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term growth potential. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can also mitigate risk, spreading your investments across different assets. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with reliable news sources. Understanding the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind market movements can help you react rationally, avoiding emotional decisions. Strategies for Bitcoin Trading in Turbulent Times For those actively engaged in Bitcoin trading , turbulent times demand a disciplined approach. It is not about avoiding risk entirely, but managing it effectively. Here are some strategies that traders often employ: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps smooth out the impact of volatility by averaging your purchase price over time. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically sell your assets if they fall to a certain price, limiting potential losses and protecting your capital. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always research before making any trading decisions. Understand the project, its fundamentals, and its potential, rather than relying on hype. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear and greed are powerful emotions in trading. Stick to your pre-defined trading plan and avoid impulsive actions based on short-term price swings. Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends The recent Bitcoin price drop is just one piece of the larger puzzle when we analyze current crypto market trends . While Bitcoin often leads the market, altcoins can react differently. Sometimes, a Bitcoin dip can lead to altcoin rallies as capital flows into other assets, or it can pull the entire market down. Monitoring the overall market capitalization, trading volumes, and investor sentiment across various assets provides a more comprehensive picture. The market is constantly evolving, influenced by technological advancements, regulatory clarity, and broader economic shifts. Staying attuned to these trends helps in forecasting potential future movements. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $114,000, as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency space. While such movements can be unsettling, they are a normal part of the market cycle. By understanding the potential triggers, adopting robust risk management strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these turbulent waters more effectively. Staying informed and making rational decisions, rather than reacting to every fluctuation, is key to success in the dynamic world of Bitcoin and beyond. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Is this Bitcoin price drop unusual for the cryptocurrency market? No, price drops and significant volatility are common in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, like other digital assets, experiences frequent price fluctuations due to various factors including market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic events. This specific Bitcoin price drop is part of its typical market cycle. 2. What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is currently down? If your Bitcoin investment is down, it‚Äôs crucial to avoid panic selling. Consider reviewing your original investment thesis, assessing your risk tolerance, and sticking to a long-term strategy if that was your initial plan. Strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can also help mitigate the impact of market dips over time. 3. How does regulatory news affect a BTC market dip? Regulatory news can significantly impact a BTC market dip . Positive regulatory clarity or supportive frameworks can boost investor confidence and prices. Conversely, news of stricter regulations, bans, or increased scrutiny can lead to fear and selling pressure, causing prices to fall. 4. Is Bitcoin still a good investment despite its volatility? Many investors believe Bitcoin remains a strong long-term investment due to its limited supply, growing adoption, and role as a decentralized asset. While cryptocurrency volatility is inherent, the long-term trend has historically been upward. However, it‚Äôs essential to conduct your own research and consider your personal financial situation. 5. What are the key indicators to watch for future crypto market trends? To understand future crypto market trends , keep an eye on global economic indicators, major regulatory developments, institutional adoption rates of cryptocurrencies, technological advancements within the blockchain space, and overall market sentiment as reflected in trading volumes and social media discussions.

Peirce used a ‚Äúpeanut butter and watermelon‚Äù anecdote to illustrate the value of disintermediation or removing intermediaries from processes, in this case, finances. The pro-crypto commissioner was critical of financial surveillance and the banking system, stating that the 55-year-old Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) has ‚Äúdeputized American financial institutions as de facto law enforcement investigators.‚Äù A Surveillance State The current financial system is a surveillance state. In 2024, 324,000 financial institutions filed more than 25 million transaction reports, including 4.7 million ‚ÄúSuspicious Activity Reports.‚Äù Meanwhile, third-party doctrine allows the government to access financial data without warrants, and the SEC‚Äôs Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) tracks every investor‚Äôs trading activity without suspicion of wrongdoing. Privacy-protecting crypto technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, mixers, and privacy pools can reduce reliance on intermediaries while DeFi protocols offer transparent, equal access without discrimination, she said. ‚ÄúA bank that might not want to lend to certain types of people gives way to a DeFi protocol through which everybody can borrow on the same, publicly transparent terms.‚Äù Grateful to SEC Commissioner @HesterPeirce for spotlighting the need to defend Americans‚Äô right to financial privacy and including @katie_haun ‚Äòs argument that our financial data is among the most sensitive personal information we produce. This is an issue too often overlooked‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/7N7IPU5fWf ‚Äî Haun Ventures (@HaunVentures) August 4, 2025 Peirce made several policy recommendations to protect Americans‚Äô right to self-custody crypto assets, not to prosecute open-source privacy software developers, and to avoid requiring intermediaries in peer-to-peer transactions. ‚ÄúWe should not ask peers transacting with one another, where no intermediary exists, to collect and report information on each other. Doing so would deputize us to surveil our neighbors‚Äîa practice antithetical to a free society.‚Äù SEC Launches ‚ÄòProject Crypto‚Äô ‚ÄúWe will make sure the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America,‚Äù SEC chair Paul Atkins said on Monday.

2025-08-05 07:58:53,49570241,1754380733,The 10X Profit Potential: How FUNToken‚Äôs Deflationary Model and Community Engagement Are Fueling the Surge to $0.10,"While most tokens rely on speculation alone to justify bold price predictions, FUNToken ($FUN) is building a case for its next milestone - $0.10 - on far more solid ground. Trading around $0.0225 at the time of writing, FUN has already delivered consistent growth underpinned by measurable adoption and a disciplined approach to supply reduction. With a target that represents nearly a 5X return from current levels - and a 10X profit for early 2025 accumulators - many traders are asking: Is this momentum sustainable? A closer look at FUNToken‚Äôs deflationary mechanics and community incentives suggests the answer may be yes. Deflation by Design: A Model That Shrinks Supply One of the most powerful forces behind FUNToken‚Äôs recent surge is its predictable, revenue-backed deflationary model, a system that rewards real usage with measurable scarcity. Unlike projects that announce token burns to generate headlines but never deliver, FUNToken has built a consistent framework that connects every burn directly to platform activity. ‚óè In June 2025, the project permanently removed 25 million tokens from circulation. This burn was not funded by reserves or one-off treasury spending; it was driven by actual transaction revenue collected from gameplay fees, mission completions, and engagement inside the ecosystem. ‚óè The burn itself was fully traceable on-chain, providing the community with transparent proof of execution. This transparency has become a cornerstone of FUNToken‚Äôs strategy, reinforcing investor confidence that scarcity here is an operational commitment. ‚óè Quarterly burns are scheduled as part of the long-term roadmap . As the platform expands to 30 live games and rolls out the FUN Wallet mobile app with integrated staking, each burn event is expected to grow in size. More users and higher transaction volumes mean more revenue, and more tokens removed from supply. ‚óè Every time a burn occurs, the remaining tokens become proportionally scarcer, gradually tightening the market and supporting upward price pressure as demand expands. This disciplined approach to supply reduction is what sets FUNToken apart from competitors relying only on speculation. Community Engagement That Drives Daily Demand Supply reduction alone isn‚Äôt enough to sustain momentum - especially in crypto. What makes FUNToken‚Äôs approach unique is how it pairs deflation with a vibrant, fast-growing community that fuels daily demand. ‚óè The AI-powered Telegram bot has become the daily entry point for over 105,000 players, offering everything from quizzes and missions to hyper-casual games and the Wheel of Fortune. This constant engagement creates a predictable stream of microtransactions, each contributing revenue that funds future burns. ‚óè The $5 million giveaway is one of the largest incentive programs in Web3 gaming. Unlike limited-time promotions, this campaign rewards users for holding FUN tokens, referring friends, and participating consistently. This not only drives organic growth but also encourages players to keep tokens in their wallets instead of trading them away. ‚óè Daily activity means FUN tokens are always in motion, being earned, spent, staked, and re-earned. This dynamic keeps liquidity healthy and helps maintain a steady baseline of demand, even during broader market volatility. ‚óè The project‚Äôs roadmap reinforces this engagement cycle. Upcoming milestones like the launch of the FUN Wallet app, the expansion to new gaming experiences, and the integration of staking rewards all deepen the reasons players log in daily. Taken together, these elements form a self-sustaining ecosystem where every mission, spin, and referral supports adoption and reinforces the deflationary model. This is why, even when market sentiment cools, FUNToken‚Äôs engaged community acts as an engine that keeps the project moving forward, and why many see the $0.10 target as a realistic step, not a marketing slogan. Why the $0.10 Target Looks Credible Reaching $0.10 is no small feat. But there are clear reasons why this goal is realistic if the roadmap continues to deliver: Ongoing Quarterly BurnsEvery three months, tokens are removed from circulation, tightening supply. As more players participate, each burn grows in scale. Expansion to 30 Live GamesA larger catalog means more microtransactions, which generate additional revenue to fund buybacks and burns. FUN Wallet Mobile AppLaunching in Q3/Q4, the app will integrate staking, making it effortless for users to lock up tokens and reduce circulating supply. Daily Utility and IncentivesThe combination of the Telegram bot, the giveaway, and consistent mission rewards keeps the community active, reducing speculative churn. When adoption and deflation advance together, the price potential becomes much stronger. What to Watch as the Year Progresses If you‚Äôre tracking FUNToken‚Äôs journey toward $0.10, here are the key milestones to keep in focus: ‚óè Next scheduled burn events and whether their scale increases as forecasted. ‚óè The launch of the FUN Wallet mobile app, which will make staking accessible to casual players. ‚óè Ongoing expansion to 30+ live games, driving higher transaction volumes. ‚óè Growth in Telegram engagement and community size, especially as the $5 million giveaway continues to attract new participants. Together, these developments create the conditions where a 10X profit isn‚Äôt just a headline. It becomes a measurable possibility. Final Thoughts FUNToken‚Äôs strategy is clear: build daily utility, reduce supply, and reward loyalty. The combination of a disciplined deflationary model and a highly engaged community is what gives this project a credible path to $0.10 by the end of the year. For early participants, this could be the foundation for one of Web3 gaming‚Äôs most significant success stories.

2025-08-05 07:58:05,49571868,1754380685,Litecoin Surges 10% on ETF Hopes and Merchant Activity Amid Quiet Rotation,"Litecoin (LTC) rose by more than 11% in the past 24 hours, edging above $123, marking one of the sharpest large-cap rallies this week as traders rotated into legacy altcoins amid improving sentiment and fresh ETF chatter. The move, which made LTC as the largest weekly gainer among the top hundred tokens, comes as a mix of structural adoption and regulatory tailwinds. In July, litecoin accounted for 14.5% of all crypto payments on CoinGate, the firm said in an X post , leapfrogging stablecoins like USDT and USDC and second only to bitcoin (BTC). As such, speculation over a spot ETF continues to build despite the SEC delaying its decision on Grayscale‚Äôs application until October. Bloomberg analysts pegged the odds of eventual approval at 90% in early July, citing LTC‚Äôs commodity classification by the CFTC ‚Äî a distinction that reduces legal risk and places it alongside bitcoin and ether (ETH) in regulatory clarity. Elsewhere, MEI Pharma disclosed a $100 million litecoin allocation last month, echoing early bitcoin treasury moves and giving LTC a new angle as a low-beta treasury asset. While the buy hasn‚Äôt moved markets materially, the optics help. Meanwhile, data from CoinDesk Analytics shows LTC broke above its 7-day simple moving average and faces a key pivot level at $117.61. Relative strength index (RSI) sits at 69.5 ‚Äî elevated, but not yet signaling exhaustion. However, early MACD divergence suggests momentum may be cooling if inflows don‚Äôt sustain.

The regulator, on Monday, highlighted non-compliance issues in offshore crypto exchanges, warning the public against engaging with them. The ten crypto exchanges offered services to Filipinos without the required registration or authorization from the Commission, as mandated under SEC CASP Rules and Guidelines, which came into effect on 05 July 2025. Source: Philippines SEC ‚ÄúThese platforms have no license, registration, or authorization from the SEC to operate in the Philippines or to solicit investments from the public,‚Äù the SEC noted. ‚ÄúTheir actions are unauthorized and expose Filipino investors to significant risk.‚Äù Philippines SEC to Take Enforcement Action Against Violators, Similar to Binance In April 2024, the financial regulator of the Philippines blocked local user access to Binance , citing concerns over the firm‚Äôs unlicensed operations in the country. The action left citizens unable to withdraw their funds. The SEC terminated Binance‚Äôs website access and online trading platform after receiving the assistance of the National Telecommunication Commission (NTC). Additionally, the regulator said at the time that blocking Binance from app stores like Google and Apple stores would help ‚Äúprevent the further proliferation of its illegal activities in the country.‚Äù On a similar note, the SEC said Monday that upon compliant, the Commission shall take legal and regulatory action against the ten violators. This includes issuance of cease and desist orders, blocking their websites and apps, and filing of criminal complaints, among others. Besides the 10 crypto firms, the Philippine SEC flagged that several other platforms remain accessible and are conducting unauthorized marketing activities targeting Filipino residents.

Key Takeaways: BitMine holds 833,137 ETH worth over $3 billion, making it the largest corporate Ethereum holder. The firm‚Äôs aggressive strategy puts it far ahead of rivals just one month after announcing its ETH push. BitMine is betting on Ethereum‚Äôs upside amid shifting macro conditions. The move cements BitMine‚Äôs position as the top Ethereum-holding treasury firm and places it fourth among global crypto treasuries overall, according to a Monday press release . The purchase was disclosed on Monday, coinciding with a sharp Ether price swing that saw the asset climb 5.8% to $3,730 before easing back to $3,654, according to CoinGecko. BitMine Accelerates Ethereum Push Just One Month Into New Strategy BitMine‚Äôs latest accumulation highlights its aggressive entry into the Ethereum space just over a month after the firm unveiled its ETH strategy. ‚ÄúWe have separated ourselves among crypto treasury peers,‚Äù Lee said in a statement, emphasizing the rapid pace at which the firm has raised its crypto net asset value per share. ‚ÄúBitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‚Äòalchemy of 5%‚Äô of ETH.‚Äù The firm‚Äôs acceleration puts distance between it and rivals like SharpLink Gaming, which holds 438,200 ETH worth $1.61 billion, and The Ether Machine, now at 345,400 ETH after a $40 million buy on the same day. Rounding out the top five are the Ethereum Foundation (232,600 ETH) and PulseChain SAC (166,300 ETH), according to StrategicETHReserve data. BitMine‚Äôs rise has been fueled by notable backing. Investors include billionaire Bill Miller III, macro veteran Stanley Druckenmiller, and ARK Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood ‚Äî all vocal advocates for long-term crypto exposure. The firm‚Äôs positioning signals rising institutional conviction in Ethereum, which has outperformed in recent weeks while attempting to close the gap with leaders Bitcoin and Solana. Lee told CNBC he expects further upside in August, citing soft labor data and a possible pivot in U.S. monetary policy. He said signs of an easing Federal Reserve could lift both equities and crypto markets, potentially pushing the S&P 500 to new all-time highs ‚Äî a move that would likely benefit Ether. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to rally pretty strongly in August,‚Äù says Tom Lee of @Fundstrat . ‚ÄúI think we can get to 6500, 6600 [on the S&P 500] and all-time highs in the next couple of weeks.‚Äù https://t.co/ZAsld9FqER ‚Äî Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) August 4, 2025 With its latest buy, BitMine is not just betting on price appreciation but also staking its claim as a dominant force in Ethereum treasury strategy, outpacing peers both in speed and size. BitMine Launches $1B Buyback as ETH Holdings Top $2.3B Last week, BitMine announced a $1 billion stock buyback program as its Ethereum holdings surged past 625,000 ETH, worth $2.3 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of Ethereum to date. The open-ended repurchase plan comes amid BitMine‚Äôs larger goal of acquiring 5% of Ethereum‚Äôs total supply, a move it sees as part of a long-term capital strategy. Chairman Tom Lee described the buyback as a flexible way to optimize capital allocation on the firm‚Äôs path toward what he calls ‚Äúthe alchemy of 5%.‚Äù The announcement follows a massive ETH accumulation in July, including a single 16-day purchase of 566,776 ETH worth over $2 billion, vaulting BitMine past competitors like SharpLink and the Ethereum Foundation. BMNR shares have skyrocketed over 3,000% since early July as investors react to the aggressive accumulation strategy.

2025-08-05 07:38:27,49569358,1754379507,XRP Case Update: SEC Chair Fuels Hope of Ending Appeal Against Ripple,"A new tweet from SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, alongside a public video statement, has reignited interest in the future of U.S. crypto policy. Legal expert Bill Morgan weighs the possibility of his influence on SEC commissioners‚Äô votes to end the long-standing case. The chairman officially launched ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù which he described as a commission-wide initiative aimed at modernizing securities regulations to ensure the United States becomes a global leader in blockchain and crypto asset technology. In his tweet, Atkins stated , ‚ÄúWe will make sure the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America.‚Äù In the accompanying video, Atkins emphasized that the SEC, under his leadership, would not stand by while digital innovation and capital markets advance overseas. He referenced the President‚Äôs Working Group (PWG) report on Digital Asset Markets, calling it a ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù for maintaining U.S. dominance in the crypto space. The report outlines recommendations for agencies like the SEC to help build a regulatory structure enabling America‚Äôs financial markets to transition on-chain. Atkins made it clear that the SEC intends to lead actively in this transformation, noting that the initiative aligns with President Trump‚Äôs broader goals for digital asset leadership. Stuart Alderoty Responds to the Announcement Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, responded to Atkins‚Äô statement on X, focusing on the contrast between the SEC‚Äôs current stance and its previous regulatory approach. Alderoty said, ‚ÄúChair Atkins knows the prior administration pushed crypto companies offshore. He‚Äôs now focused on clear, tailored standards ‚Äî and drawing firm lines to curb SEC overreach.‚Äù Chair Atkins knows the prior administration pushed crypto companies offshore. He‚Äôs now focused on clear, tailored standards ‚Äîand drawing firm lines to curb SEC overreach. https://t.co/gyGaLR398S ‚Äî Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) August 4, 2025 Ripple CLO‚Äôs comment highlights the often-cited criticism that the former SEC administration under Chair Gary Gensler created an uncertain and adversarial regulatory climate for U.S.-based crypto firms, which some believe compelled them to relocate their operations overseas. Alderoty‚Äôs post implies optimism about the change in tone from the SEC‚Äôs highest office, suggesting that the new leadership may aim to establish regulatory clarity through measured reforms instead of enforcement-centric tactics. The emphasis on ‚Äúcurbing SEC overreach‚Äù highlights a significant theme in Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal conflict with the agency. Bill Morgan Raises Legal Implications for Ripple Appeal Responding directly to Alderoty‚Äôs post, Australian legal expert Bill Morgan offered a pointed question that drew immediate attention from those closely following the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit.

Morgan is questioning whether, under the newly announced Project Crypto initiative and its stated goal of regulatory clarity and pro-innovation policy, Chair Atkins will push for a withdrawal of the appeal. Such a move would require the support of the SEC‚Äôs commissioners and action by the agency‚Äôs legal team. This comment from Morgan implies a potential test of the new SEC leadership‚Äôs sincerity in implementing its stated policy objectives. If the SEC genuinely aims to abandon the enforcement-heavy approach of the past, then ending the legal battle against Ripple could serve as a defining early move for the administration.

2025-08-05 07:37:34,49569699,1754379454,SoftBank raised its stake in Nvidia and TSMC,"SoftBank Group Corp. is deepening its commitment to artificial intelligence by significantly increasing its investments in key chipmakers, including Nvidia Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). This move highlights CEO Masayoshi Son‚Äôs sharpened focus on the hardware driving the AI revolution. According to regulatory filings , SoftBank raised its stake in Nvidia to around $3 billion by the end of March, up from $1 billion in the previous quarter. It also acquired roughly $330 million in TSMC shares and $170 million in Oracle Corp. Meanwhile, a person familiar with the matter said that SoftBank‚Äôs Vision Fund monetized nearly $2 billion in assets during the first half of 2025. While the Vision Fund continues to prioritize returns, there‚Äôs reportedly no pressure from SoftBank to accelerate asset sales. The company declined to comment. Son Rebuilds AI empire around arm to reclaim lost ground in chip race At the center of SoftBank‚Äôs AI strategy is Arm Holdings Plc, the UK-based chip designer with a 90% stake. Son is now crafting a portfolio of key industry players around Arm, aiming to regain ground after missing the historic AI-fueled rally that propelled Nvidia to a $4 trillion valuation and TSMC close to $1 trillion. ‚ÄúNvidia is the picks and shovels for the gold rush of AI,‚Äù said Ben Narasin, founder of Tenacity Venture Capital. SoftBank‚Äôs growing stake in Nvidia may give it greater influence ‚Äî and potentially faster access ‚Äî to the chipmaker‚Äôs in-demand hardware, he added. ‚ÄúMaybe he gets to skip the line.‚Äù SoftBank is expected to report strong paper gains from its Nvidia bet when it announces earnings on Thursday. Since its April low, Nvidia‚Äôs market value has surged nearly 90%, while TSMC shares are up over 40%. Despite being an early believer in AI, SoftBank sold a 4.9% stake in Nvidia in 2019 ‚Äî a position that would now be worth more than $200 billion. Massive losses at the Vision Fund also limited its capacity to invest aggressively in generative AI early on. Son spearheads large-scale initiatives like the $500 billion Stargate data center project with OpenAI, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi‚Äôs MGX fund. He‚Äôs also in talks with TSMC and others to build a $1 trillion AI chip manufacturing hub in Arizona. Comgest Asset Management‚Äôs Richard Kaye believes Son views himself as the natural provider of AI semiconductor technology, aiming to control the industry‚Äôs upstream and downstream segments. SoftBank rallies investors as Son eyes big AI deals Investors are buying into Son‚Äôs vision. SoftBank‚Äôs shares hit a record high last month, buoyed by strong AI exposure and plans for a $6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing LLC and a possible $30 billion investment in OpenAI. Still, SoftBank trades at a roughly 40% discount to its net asset value, which includes its dominant stake in the $148 billion-valued Arm. Its $119 billion market cap remains a fraction of AI giants like Nvidia. To navigate regulatory headwinds, Son is leveraging his connections with Donald Trump and is reportedly holding frequent meetings with U.S. officials. This comes as SoftBank‚Äôs planned acquisition of Ampere faces an FTC review amid heightened scrutiny of AI and semiconductor deals. Investors will be watching Thursday‚Äôs earnings for clues on which assets SoftBank may divest next to fund its hardware ambitions. The firm raised about $4.8 billion in June by selling part of its T-Mobile stake. CFO Yoshimitsu Goto has cited a net asset value of ¬•25.7 trillion ($175 billion), indicating sufficient liquidity for continued expansion. Over the past year, the Vision Fund exited holdings in DoorDash, View Inc., Wiz, and Peak, while ramping up purchases of Nvidia, TSMC, and Oracle shares. In June, Son told shareholders that SoftBank is pursuing AI through a broad network of startups and group companies, intending to position itself as the key architect behind the leading platform in the era of artificial super intelligence.

2025-08-05 07:32:32,49583801,1754379152,Expert Recommends Holding At Least 0.01 Bitcoin for Each Loved One,"A popular crypto YouTube channel has advised people to hold Bitcoin for each of their loved ones. Altcoin Daily advises crypto investors to hold .01 Bitcoin for each family member they care about. The message, shared via X, aims to remind investors about Bitcoin‚Äôs value and the returns it could give in the long term.Bitcoin's Growing AppealThe recommendation reflects a growing perception of Bitcoin as more than just a volatile crypto asset. With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a strategic reserve asset among investors and nations.¬†At the current trading price of approximately $114,400, holding .01 BTC amounts to an investment of about $1,144. However, Altcoin Daily‚Äôs message appeals to the idea that small, intentional holdings can make a significant difference in the future, especially if Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to rise over time.Expert Voices Echo Bitcoin Accumulation StrategyAltcoin Daily is not the only voice encouraging Bitcoin accumulation. Author of The Bitcoin Thesis, Cole Walmsley, echoed a similar sentiment, saying 0.01 BTC could secure your long-term stake in a Bitcoin-driven future. He sees a ‚Äúmonetary singularity‚Äù where all global value is priced in Bitcoin.Walmsley estimated that 0.01 BTC could eventually be worth $476,000 if Bitcoin captures $1 quadrillion in global value. He calls it the ‚Äúgreatest asymmetric opportunity,‚Äù arguing your downside is limited to your investment, while the upside could be infinite.https://twitter.com/Cole_Walmsley/status/1945577851773665309Meanwhile, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has always advocated for Bitcoin. In July, the investor bought one Bitcoin for over $100,000 , saying he‚Äôd rather risk being wrong than miss out on its potential rise to $1 million. Kiyosaki believes the price will eventually hit seven figures. Just like Altcoin Daily, Kiyosaki had earlier encouraged his followers to buy even $500 worth of Bitcoin.Meanwhile, Strategy Michael Saylor has also consistently maintained a strong pro-Bitcoin stance. Yesterday, Saylor called Bitcoin ‚Äú an offer you can‚Äôt refuse‚Äù as Strategy‚Äôs holdings reached 628,791 BTC, now worth $71.87 billion. The company began accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020 and has since grown its position, making it the largest public company holder of the asset.Adding to the long-term bullish sentiment, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, speaking at the Bitcoin conference, projected Bitcoin‚Äôs future value between $250,000 and $500,000 , envisioning a $10 trillion ecosystem.¬†How Much Will .01 BTC Reach?Notably, other experts are also superbullish on Bitcoin's long-term potential. Ark Invest updated its Bitcoin outlook, predicting a worst-case price of $300K‚Äì$500K by 2030 , representing gains of approximately 162% to 337% from the current price of $114,400. In its Big Ideas 2025 report, the firm also forecasts a base case of $1.2 million (950% increase) and a bullish scenario of $2.4 million, implying a potential 1,998% surge. At these projections, an investment of $1,144 today could grow to between $3,000 and $5,000 in the worst-case, around $12,000 in the base case, and up to $24,000 if the bullish scenario plays out.0.01 Bitcoin Address Crosses 12 Million¬†As of this press time, over 12.3 million Bitcoin addresses hold more than 0.01 BTC, reflecting a steady rise in grassroots adoption despite years of price volatility. According to a chart, wallet growth has remained consistent even during market downturns, indicating growing interest from smaller holders. Number of addresses holding 01 BTC Number of addresses holding .01 BTC Starting near zero in 2010, the number of addresses neared 7.5 million by 2018 and jumped to over 9 million by 2022. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price climbed from under $1 in 2010 to above $100,000 in 2025.

2025-08-05 07:30:46,49580164,1754379046,"This CIP Is ‚ÄòMassive‚Äô For Cardano DApps, Says Anastasia Labs CEO","A still-unnumbered ‚ÄúAccount Enhancement‚Äù Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) has ignited an unusually broad wave of enthusiasm inside the ecosystem after Anastasia Labs chief executive Phillip Disarro framed it as a breakthrough for decentralized-application design. Why This CIP Could Be ‚ÄòMassive‚Äô For Cardano ‚ÄúThis CIP is massive for expanding Cardano‚Äôs dApp ecosystem. Out of the gate, it makes implementing onchain dApp governance systems, a task that is extremely difficult now, completely trivial. If you are a developer in the ecosystem, please give this CIP a read,‚Äù Disarro told his followers on X late Monday. Less than six hours later Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson amplified the call for scrutiny, posting ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get this reviewed!‚Äù According to the README preview visible on GitHub , the proposal adds native-asset deposit support to Cardano reward-style accounts. In practical terms the change would allow transaction outputs that lock only non-ADA tokens as deposits, let smart contracts pay sub-ADA ‚Äúmicro-fees‚Äù by streaming fractions of a token into the recipient‚Äôs reward address, and permit the Cardano Treasury to hold diversified native-asset balances instead of ADA alone. By shifting deposit accounting away from the UTxO layer and into the reward-account mechanism, the draft sidesteps a design choice that has long irritated dApp teams: today every token-carrying output must include at least 1 ADA to protect the ledger against spam and bloat, an overhead that makes micro-transactions economically impossible. Most Cardano DeFi protocols treat their governance or fee tokens as first-class ‚Äúnative assets,‚Äù yet are forced to charge users ADA to cover both minimum-value and network-fee requirements. The Account Enhancement CIP proposes a path to issue fees directly in protocol tokens without forcing users to top-up ADA balances, build lightweight, on-chain voting contracts because deposits can be collected and refunded in governance tokens rather than in ADA, and simplify Treasury accounting for the upcoming Voltaire governance era , whose blueprint is sketched in CIP-1694 . Next Steps In The Process The draft has not yet been assigned an official number. To progress it must clear the public review cycle defined in CIP-1, during which a volunteer editor triages comments before the Cardano Foundation‚Äôs CIP editors decide whether to merge, request revisions or reject the proposal outright. If adopted, the change would be delivered in a future protocol update; no hard-fork date is yet on the table. Still, developers who have reviewed the text say the proposal‚Äôs scope is ‚Äúsurgically narrow but strategically huge,‚Äù because it attacks a single bottleneck that has kept Cardano dApps from offering the sub-cent user experience common on account-based chains. Whether that promise survives the review gauntlet now depends on how quickly the community can validate the design ‚Äî exactly the scrutiny Hoskinson called for overnight.

2025-08-05 07:29:06,49568964,1754378946,HTX DeepthinkÔºöMacro Dislocation and Crypto Re-Pricing ‚Äì How Fed Revaluation and ‚ÄúProject Crypto‚Äù Are Resetting the Playing Field,"The Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest rate decision jolted global markets‚Äîbut it was the unexpected collapse in U.S. job growth that truly reshaped investor expectations. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research offers insights into recent macro surprises and the regulatory pivot reshaping crypto‚Äôs policy landscape. Soft Jobs Data Resets Market Expectations After the July FOMC meeting, the Fed left the funds rate at 5.25%-5.50% and offered no timeline for rate cuts, stoking fears of a ‚Äúhigher-for-longer‚Äù regime. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.24% , the U.S.-Dollar Index reclaimed the 100 handle, gold slipped below $3,270 , and Bitcoin retreated to the $116,000 area as on-chain activity cooled. Three days later, the macro narrative flipped: July non-farm payrolls ‚Äúcollapsed,‚Äù with only 73k jobs versus the 180k consensus, while May‚ÄìJune gains were revised down by roughly 129k (-90 %). The sudden chill forced an aggressive rate reset‚ÄîCME FedWatch showed the probability of a September cut surging from 38% to 82% , with two cuts by year-end now priced at 64% . The 10-year yield slid below 4.10% , gold bounced $40 to $3,363/oz , and Bitcoin briefly spiked before recession angst pushed it to an intraday low near $112,000 . Yet the broader economy still resembles a growth-slowdown rather than a full-blown recession. By 2025 Q2, household debt stood at 98% of disposable income ‚Äîwell below the 2008 peak of 133%. Credit-card delinquencies eased from 2.7% to 2.5% ; retail sales are holding a 2.8%-3.1% YoY band. America‚Äôs richest 10% control 72% of household wealth and finance nearly half of total consumption, providing a sturdy demand floor. On the corporate side, JPMorgan and Bank of America report commercial-loan growth of 5%-7% YoY , with no material uptick in loss reserves. Historically, a mix of softer payrolls and sticky-but-easing inflation marks the Fed‚Äôs turn toward accommodation, ushering in a ‚Äúhigh-volatility liquidity window‚Äù where BTC and gold attract hedging flows while leveraged alt-coins face valuation and deleveraging pressure. Regulatory Shift Opens Up DeFi and RWA Momentum The truly disruptive catalyst comes from regulation. On 31 July , SEC Chair Paul Atkins unveiled ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù pledging to put U.S. finance ‚Äúfully on-chain‚Äù via deregulation, innovation safe-harbors and exemptions. Atkins stated that most crypto assets should not be defaulted into securities status and that AMMs and on-chain lending are ‚Äúnon-intermediated financial activity‚Äù deserving legal recognition. The signal unlocks huge upside for DeFi protocols such as Uniswap , Aave and Lido , long suppressed by the ‚Äúsecurities overhang.‚Äù According to data from HTX, DeFi tokens including UNI and AAVE have recorded notable gains in August. Atkins also floated a ‚ÄúSuper-App‚Äù license for brokers to aggregate equities, crypto, staking and lending. The draft further names ERC-3643 ‚Äîwith its ONCHAINID permission layer‚Äîas the reference standard for tokenized RWA, paving a compliant path for real estate, private equity and other trillion-dollar markets. Crucially, the SEC will revise the decades-old Howey Test , introducing clear disclosure waivers and safe harbors for airdrops, ICOs and staking, ending the era where founders had to ‚Äúflee to Cayman‚Äù or geo-block U.S. users; venture capital could now re-shore, reigniting an on-chain startup cycle in America. Outlook and Structural Signals Bitcoin and Ethereum remain central to market structure, with BTC dominance and stablecoin basis offering key signals for capital rotation. High-beta altcoins and leveraged products may remain under pressure, particularly if the U.S. dollar strengthens or long-term yields rebound above 4.40%. Tokens with clear compliance paths‚Äîespecially DeFi governance assets and RWA tokens built on ERC-3643‚Äîare increasingly positioned to benefit from evolving policy support and real-world adoption narratives. With macro softening, liquidity conditions easing, and regulatory upgrading now converging, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a global inflation hedge and policy-beta asset is hardening, while on-chain finance enjoys its first genuine policy tail-wind‚Äîsetting the stage for the next structural up-cycle in crypto markets. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

Key Takeaways: MEXC Ventures invested in Triv at a $200M valuation to grow its Southeast Asia footprint. Triv is one of Indonesia‚Äôs oldest licensed exchanges, operating under OJK and BAPPEBTI. The funding will boost Triv‚Äôs coin offerings, liquidity, and crypto media operations. The deal, confirmed on August 5 , marks part of MEXC‚Äôs broader plan to strengthen its presence in Southeast Asia, though the investment amount remains undisclosed. Founded in 2015, Triv is one of Indonesia‚Äôs longest-running digital asset exchanges, with over 3 million registered users. Triv Operates Under OJK and BAPPEBTI Oversight Triv operates with regulatory oversight from Indonesia‚Äôs Financial Services Authority (OJK) and the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI), offering services in spot trading, staking, and futures. The exchange competes in a crowded field that includes Binance-backed Tokocrypto, Pantera-funded Pintu, and Indodax. It also faces pressure from new entrants. This includes Hong Kong-based OSL Group, which acquired local player Evergreen Crest Holdings in June for $15 million. Until now, Triv has not revealed any outside capital involvement. It is unclear if this is the platform‚Äôs first institutional funding round, and MEXC Ventures has not shared details on the size or terms of the deal. ‚ÄúIndonesia is one of the most dynamic and promising digital asset markets in the region,‚Äù said Leo Zhao, investment director at MEXC Ventures. ‚ÄúTriv has earned a strong reputation for compliance, security, and user trust.‚Äù Triv CEO Gabriel Rey said the funding will help expand its coin listings, improve liquidity, and scale its crypto news arm, CryptoWave Media. Indonesia‚Äôs New Crypto Tax Rules Kick In The timing of the investment is notable, coming just after the implementation of Indonesia‚Äôs updated crypto tax rules on August 1 . The revised structure imposes a 0.21% tax on domestic exchange users, double the previous rate. For users trading through foreign platforms, the seller tax has surged from 0.2% to 1%. While VAT on purchases has been removed, crypto miners now face a 2.2% VAT and will soon be subject to regular income tax rates as a special 0.1% mining tax is phased out by 2026. In Indonesia, crypto is permitted for investment but not for payments. The market is growing rapidly. Crypto transactions in 2023 topped 650 trillion rupiah (around $40 billion), and user numbers across licensed platforms have surpassed 20 million, outpacing the country‚Äôs stock market participation. As reported, Indonesia‚Äôs annual crypto tax revenue jumped sharply in 2024, marking its highest level since the government introduced taxation on digital assets in 2022. According to officials from the Directorate General of Taxes, the country collected 620 billion rupiah (around $38 million) last year, a 181% rise from the 220 billion rupiah recorded in 2023. The sharp increase reflects a broader surge in local crypto activity. Officials attributed the growth to a rise in transaction volumes, which reportedly reached 650 trillion rupiah ($39.67 billion) in 2024.

The Significance of Blockchain Block Generation Resumption The successful resumption of blockchain block generation on Base is a positive indicator for the network‚Äôs health and its operational robustness. For users, it means their transactions can once again be processed and confirmed efficiently. For developers, it ensures the continuity of their dApps and services built on the Base platform. A brief Base network outage like this, when resolved promptly, can actually serve as a testament to the team‚Äôs ability to manage and mitigate technical challenges. It demonstrates that the underlying infrastructure is capable of recovering quickly, which is essential for any growing blockchain ecosystem aiming for widespread adoption. What Does This Mean for Base Users? For everyday users of the Base network, the temporary suspension and subsequent resumption mean minimal disruption.

2025-08-05 07:07:12,49569369,1754377632,Bitcoin's Long-Term Bullishness Evaporates From Options Market as Inflation Concern Rises,"The bitcoin (BTC) bull, once confidently gazing into the future, is reconsidering its long-term bullish conviction. That's evident from the 180-day skew, measuring the difference in implied volatility (pricing) between Deribit-listed out-of-the-money call and put options. The metric has recently retreated to zero, according to data source Amberdata, indicating that long-term market sentiment has shifted from bullish to neutral. The shift comes as some analysts warn of a bear market in 2026. A similar reset occurred at the onset of the previous bitcoin bear market, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. ""I've noticed a rather worrying sign with the recent market pullback. Bitcoin's bullish sentiment for the far-month options has vanished, and it is now firmly neutral,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""This means the options market believes it's difficult for BTC to establish a long-term uptrend, and the likelihood of new highs in the coming months is decreasing."" ""A similar situation last occurred in Jan and Feb 2022,"" he added. A put option offers insurance against price drops in the underlying asset, while a call provides an asymmetric bullish exposure. A positive skew implies a bias towards calls, indicating bullishness in the market, whereas a negative skew suggests the opposite. The neutral shift in the 180-day skew could be partly driven by structured products selling higher strike call options to generate additional yield on top of the spot market holdings. The popularity of the so-called covered call strategy could be driving the call implied volatility lower relative to puts. Macro jitters BTC fell over 4% last week, nearly testing its former record high of $11,965, as the core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose in June, while nonfarm payrolls disappointed, stoking concerns about the economy. The price drop has pushed short-term skews below zero, a sign of traders seeking downside protection through puts. According to Ardern, the inflationary effects of ""supply chain impulses"" are already showing up in economic data. ""Although falling auto prices in the last CPI report offset rising prices for other goods, one thing is undeniable: the impulse from the West Coast of the Pacific has reached the East Coast, and retailers are already trying to pass on tariffs and a host of associated costs to consumers. While wholesalers and commodity trading firms are working to smooth supply chains, price increases will still occur, albeit more moderately or ""delayed by several months,"" Ardern noted, explaining the renewed neutrality of the long-term BTC options. According to JPMorgan, President Donald Trump's tariffs are likely to elevate inflation in the second half of the year. ""Global core inflation is projected to increase to 3.4% (annualized rate) in the second half of 2025, largely due to a tariff-related U.S. spike,"" analysts at the investment bank noted, adding that cost pressures will likely be concentrated in the U.S. An uptick in inflation could make it harder for the Fed to cut rates. Trump has repeatedly criticized the central bank for keeping rates elevated at 4.25%. Traders will receive the ISM non-manufacturing PMI later Tuesday, providing insights into inflation in the service sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the U.S. economy. It will be followed by July CPI and PPI releases later this week.

2025-08-05 07:06:18,49568040,1754377578,"Machine Learning Algorithm Sets XRP Price for August 31, 2025","XRP has emerged as the top-performing cryptocurrency among the ten largest by market capitalization, currently trading at $3.05 following a 5.3% gain over the past 24 hours. This short-term recovery comes on the heels of a difficult few weeks in which the token lost the $3 support level , reflecting the ongoing volatility that continues to define the digital asset landscape. Despite the recent turbulence, investor sentiment around XRP appears resilient. Over the past month, the token has risen by almost 39%. The asset also hit a new all-time high in July , and its recent performance points to sustained interest even as broader market conditions remain cautious. However, trading volumes have retreated notably from July‚Äôs peak. Data shows that 24-hour turnover has declined, now standing at $6.27 billion. This suggests that market enthusiasm has cooled, though accumulation continues. AI Forecast Suggests Moderate Upside To estimate XRP‚Äôs potential movement through the end of the month, we‚Äôve referenced Finbold‚Äôs machine learning framework, which is powered by multiple large language models (LLMs). These AI agents considered numerous factors, including market indicators, such as the MACD, RSI, and more. Based on this analysis, XRP is projected to reach an average price of $3.12 by August 31. This suggests a modest upside of 2.295% from its current value. While the models generally pointed to bullish continuation, there was a wide range of outcomes depending on the assumptions and indicators emphasized. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Finbold, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offered the most optimistic outlook, projecting a 15% increase amid expectations of improved liquidity and potential regulatory clarity. In contrast, GPT-4o predicted only a slight rise. While Grok 2 Vision flagged downside risks, suggesting a possible dip to $2.8, a price another analyst recently highlighted as a crucial level to watch if the asset falls. Market Outlook Hinges on Legal and Technical Factors XRP remains above its 50-day simple moving average, suggesting a constructive technical structure. However, failure to hold July highs and mixed momentum indicators have added uncertainty. The $3 level now serves as key support, with upcoming price action likely influenced by sentiment surrounding the SEC vs. Ripple case. A joint status update in the case is scheduled for August 15 and is drawing widespread attention with predictions that the lawsuit will end on that date. Though procedural, the filing may offer clues on regulatory direction. The SEC has shown a favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies, and the end of the lawsuit could help XRP outperform expectations.

In posts in his Telegram channel, pseudonymous trader Crypto Capo tells his 129,000 subscribers that BTC and altcoins could see significant dips in price in the coming weeks as risk for a black swan event remains high. According to the trader, both altcoins and BTC could see staggering price drops that see them cut in half ‚Äì or more. However, according to Capo, investors appear to be gobbling up the flagship crypto asset during dips despite signs of an impending crash. ‚ÄúInteresting how, despite all the bearish signals, people keep buying the dip. The risk of a black swan event is still high. If it happens, we could see BTC drop to $60,000-$70,000 and altcoins crashing 50-80%. Big week ahead. Time to stay focused, volatility is coming.‚Äù Near the end of July, Capo warned investors that altcoin season has yet to begin and that a shakeout is required before it does. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre wondering why your alts aren‚Äôt really going up, it‚Äôs because the altseason hasn‚Äôt started yet, and it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll see another big shakeout before it does‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a time for everything. There will be a time to get very bullish. There will be a time when altcoins pump hard for weeks. That time will come. But this isn‚Äôt it. This is a time to be bearish. Plan for the future.

2025-08-05 07:00:30,49567759,1754377230,Grayscale Welcomes Barry Silbert Back As Chairman Ahead Of US IPO,"Barry Silbert has made a notable return to Grayscale Investments, the asset management company and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, as chairman, just weeks after the crypto asset manager filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Silbert, who founded Grayscale in 2013, takes over from Mark Shifke, who will remain on the board as the company prepares for its future as a publicly traded entity. This leadership transition also coincides with Grayscale‚Äôs plans to bring in independent directors to strengthen its governance. New Executive Team At Grayscale In a significant move to bolster its executive team, Grayscale has appointed four professionals with extensive backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi). According to the firm‚Äôs announcement made on Monday, the new hires include Diana Zhang as Chief Operating Officer, Ramona Boston as Chief Marketing Officer, Andrea Williams as Chief Communications Officer, and Maxwell Rosenthal as Chief Human Resources Officer. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‚ÄòNothing To Do Until October‚Äô These executives join Grayscale from firms such as Bridgewater, Apollo, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel, reporting directly to CEO Peter Mintzberg, who has been at the helm since last year. Mintzberg stated: This blend of institutional rigor and entrepreneurial drive shapes every aspect of how we operate at Grayscale, enabling us to deliver clients innovative investment strategies with the operating integrity they expect from a trusted partner. Silbert‚Äôs return comes at a critical juncture for the company, following a turbulent period marked by regulatory scrutiny. He stepped down as chairman in late 2023, just before the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) ruling on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale‚Äôs long-standing effort to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. Around the same time, Silbert‚Äôs parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), faced legal challenges from New York‚Äôs attorney general regarding the collapse of crypto lending company Genesis, and its connections to crypto exchange Gemini‚Äôs Earn program, with Silbert himself named in the lawsuit. Regulatory Headwinds In his statement following the announcement, Silbert expressed his enthusiasm about rejoining Grayscale, emphasizing his belief in the company‚Äôs direction and the team leading it. Silbert noted: When I founded Grayscale in 2013, we saw an enormous opportunity to pioneer a new model for accessing and investing in digital assets, and to build the operational infrastructure that investors would ultimately demand. Today, I continue to have deep conviction in the company‚Äôs long-term positioning and in the leadership team guiding it forward. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level Grayscale currently manages over $35 billion across a variety of crypto investment products, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as diversified digital asset funds.

The settlement adds to the ongoing regulatory challenges faced by DCG, as New York Attorney General Letitia James has also sued Gemini, Genesis, and DCG over a crypto lending program, alleging they defrauded over 29,000 New Yorkers while concealing $1.1 billion in losses.

2025-08-05 07:00:03,49567758,1754377203,Dogecoin Price Is Approaching 4HR RSI Level That Triggered Previous 70% Rally,"After an impressive run-up back in July, the Dogecoin price as suffered a slowdown, just like the rest of the market. With this, the bears seem to have reclaimed control once again, pushing Dogecoin deeper into loss territory after taking out an important position at $0.2. Nevertheless, the current decline seems to pale in comparison to the bullishness that continues to dominate among investors, with the expectations that this correction will be only temporary. Dogecoin Price Still Showing Signs Of Bullishness According to an analysis shared by crypto analyst KrissPax, the Dogecoin price may be down right now, but it is not out of the game. This is because the meme coin is currently the subject of a bullish formation as it travels down to retest a level that has previously led to a massive price surge in the past. Related Reading: Satoshimeter Shows Where Bitcoin Price Is In This Cycle The crypto analyst pointed out that the¬†Dogecoin price is expected to fall below 30 on the 4-Hour RSI chart again, and historically, such a decline has led to a recovery. The last time that the RSI fell below 30 on the 4-Hour chart was back in June 2025, and what followed was an over 70% recovery in the next month. Using this historical performance, the Dogecoin RSI falling below 30 once again could end up registering a similar performance. The only difference this time around is that the prices are at different levels, which points to a major difference in where the highs of the uptrend will be. Last time the RSI was this low, the price was trading at the $0.14 level. This time around, the analyst explains that Dogecoin sitting at $0.2 means that there is a higher low. The good thing about the formation of higher lows is the fact that they often lead to higher highs. In the event of another 70% increase in price from here, Dogecoin could end up rallying as high as $0.34 before it loses steam. However, this would still put it at more than 50% below its all-time high of $0.74, which was hit back in 2021 and has remained the peak for the meme coin. Related Reading: Market Cap Not A Hindrance To XRP Price Reaching $1,000, Expert Explains Why As for the performance of the altcoin so far this month, after closing the month of July with a 27.1% gain, Dogecoin has already begun to give some of the gains back to the market. Data from CryptoRank shows that the cryptocurrency is already down by 5.31% this month and climbing. This is not out of the ordinary, as the month of August has historically been one of the most bearish months for the Dogecoin price. In fact, if the trend holds, then DOGE investors could be looking at an average of -10% decline this month and a close in the red.

2025-08-05 06:55:10,49567601,1754376910,Stablecoin Supply Surge: USDe & USDS See Remarkable Growth Post-GENIUS Act,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Supply Surge: USDe & USDS See Remarkable Growth Post-GENIUS Act The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing with new developments, and recent legislative changes in the United States have sparked a significant trend. We are witnessing a notable stablecoin supply surge for specific assets, particularly Ethena USDe (USDe) and Sky‚Äôs USDS. This fascinating shift is directly linked to the recent passage of the U.S. stablecoin regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act . What‚Äôs Behind the Remarkable Stablecoin Supply Surge? Following the GENIUS Act becoming law, data from platforms like DefiLlama and CoinGecko indicates a dramatic increase in the circulating supply of certain stablecoins. Specifically, the supply of USDe and USDS , which are known for offering staking rewards, has seen impressive growth. Since July 18, Ethena USDe‚Äôs circulating supply has soared by 70%, reaching approximately 9.49 billion. Similarly, Sky‚Äôs USDS has experienced a 23% increase, pushing its supply to nearly 4.81 billion. This surge highlights a clear response from the market to new regulatory frameworks. Investors are actively seeking out stablecoin options that align with their yield expectations in this evolving landscape. Decoding the GENIUS Act and Its Influence The GENIUS Act is a pivotal piece of legislation for the stablecoin sector. CryptoQuant‚Äôs Head of Research, Julio Moreno, explains a key provision: the Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly providing yields to holders. This regulation aims to bring more clarity and oversight to the stablecoin market, but it also creates a new dynamic for investors. This legislative change effectively redirects investor interest. If direct yields from issuers are no longer permitted, where do investors turn for returns on their stablecoin holdings? The answer, as the recent data shows, is towards platforms and protocols that facilitate stablecoin staking . Why Are Investors Embracing Stablecoin Staking? The appeal of staking rewards is a major driving force behind the growth of USDe and USDS . These are examples of yield-bearing stablecoins , meaning they allow holders to earn returns by participating in various decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, such as staking or liquidity provision. When traditional avenues for yield become restricted, these alternative methods gain significant traction. Investors are adapting their strategies to continue generating passive income from their stablecoin assets. This shift underscores the innovation within the crypto space, as the market finds new ways to offer value while adhering to emerging regulations. It‚Äôs a clear indication that the demand for yield in the stablecoin ecosystem remains strong. Navigating the Future of Yield-Bearing Stablecoins The ongoing stablecoin supply surge of assets like USDe and USDS illustrates a significant trend in the digital asset space. It demonstrates how regulatory developments can reshape investment behaviors and highlight specific segments of the market. As the crypto landscape matures, understanding the interplay between regulation and innovation becomes crucial. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is likely to continue as investors seek compliant ways to maximize their holdings. This trend also emphasizes the importance of robust DeFi protocols that can securely offer staking opportunities. The market is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these shifts is essential for any participant. In conclusion, the passage of the GENIUS Act has undeniably spurred a significant stablecoin supply surge for yield-offering assets like USDe and USDS . This development showcases the market‚Äôs adaptability and the persistent demand for stablecoin staking opportunities, even under new regulatory frameworks. It‚Äôs a dynamic period for stablecoins, promising continued innovation and strategic shifts for investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a U.S. stablecoin regulation bill that, among other provisions, prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly providing yields to holders. It aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for stablecoins. Why have USDe and USDS supplies surged after the GENIUS Act? The supplies of USDe and USDS have surged because, unlike traditional stablecoins under the new Act, they offer staking rewards through decentralized protocols. This makes them attractive to investors seeking yield after direct issuer-provided yields were restricted. What are yield-bearing stablecoins? Yield-bearing stablecoins are digital assets pegged to a stable value (like the U.S. dollar) that allow holders to earn returns or yield through various mechanisms, such as staking, lending, or participating in DeFi protocols. Is stablecoin staking legal under the new U.S. regulations? The GENIUS Act focuses on preventing stablecoin issuers from directly providing yield. Staking rewards typically come from decentralized protocols or other market mechanisms, which operate under different legal considerations. Investors should always research specific platforms and consult with financial advisors regarding their activities. How does this affect the broader stablecoin market? This trend suggests a shift in investor preference towards stablecoins integrated with DeFi yield opportunities. It could lead to increased innovation in yield-generating protocols and a clearer distinction between regulated issuer-backed stablecoins and decentralized yield-bearing stablecoins.

2025-08-05 06:51:40,49569367,1754376700,"Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $115K; Solana, Dogecoin Show Relative Strength as Risk-Off Sentiment Lingers","Bitcoin (BTC0 remains stuck below $115,000 after a sharp weekend drop that erased nearly $6,000 from local highs and triggered over $1 billion in liquidations across leveraged long positions. While markets have stabilized somewhat since Monday, sentiment remains fragile amid a fresh round of Donald Trump-issued tariffs and another week of choppy ETF flows. BTC traded near $114,200 in the Asian afternoon hours on Tuesday, remaining flat on the day but still below the key $115,000 ‚Äì $118,000 range that had acted as short-term support over the past two weeks. Ether (ETH) fared slightly better, recovering toward $3,650 after dipping under $3,550 over the weekend, supported by sustained institutional interest and resilient flows. ‚ÄúAlthough Bitcoin has not managed to regain ground past $115,000, Ethereum has nearly recovered this week‚Äôs dip,‚Äù said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a note to CoinDesk. ‚ÄúTreasury strategies, IPOs, and the hunt for the next MicroStrategy are fueling demand. We remain positive the bull run can continue,‚Äù Ruck said. Altcoin season over? Altcoins, meanwhile, have struggled. Solana (SOL) is down nearly 20% from last week‚Äôs highs, and XRP (XRP) is flatlining near $3 despite broader market stabilization. A colloquial narrative that ‚Äúaltseason‚Äù is imminent has weakened, with traders rotating capital back into majors or moving to the sidelines entirely. Part of the risk-off tone stems from Friday‚Äôs U.S. jobs report, which came in weaker than expected, and a fresh round of trade tensions from Washington. The result is a broad flight to safety in global markets, with crypto caught in the crossfire. Friday also marked the second-largest outflow day for bitcoin spot ETFs, and the fourth-largest for ether, dimming hopes that institutional flows would offer short-term price support. Still, not all desks are turning bearish. QCP Capital noted in a Monday note that the broader structure remains bullish. ‚ÄúThe recent drawdown appears more corrective than capitulatory,‚Äù the firm said in a client note. It highlighted growing activity in BTC options markets ‚Äî specifically 29AUG25 call flys targeting $124,000 ‚Äî as a sign that sophisticated players are positioning for a rebound. Put skew remains elevated but is not yet flashing panic. A move back above $115,000, combined with a rebound in ETF inflows and compressing implied volatility, could flip sentiment quickly, QCP said. Until then, traders are closely monitoring ETF flow data. If institutional demand stabilizes and macro jitters subside, this week‚Äôs consolidation could set the stage for a renewed push toward new highs. However, if outflows persist and risk appetite continues to fade, especially in alternative assets, markets may face another wave of de-risking before finding a true floor.

2025-08-05 06:44:24,49568171,1754376264,From $0.035 to $2? Why some predict MUTM could outrun AVAX in 2025 bull cycle,"Being built around risk-managed lending, real-yield mechanics, and a stablecoin-based revenue loop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the lean, purpose-built protocol the next bull cycle needs. Smarter lending, leaner DeFi: what sets MUTM apart AVAX rode a wave of speculation during its early growth phase. But where it once drew attention for raw speed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now standing out for something more durable: utility with built-in value. Instead of relying on inflationary incentives or vague promises, MUTM uses real lending mechanics through a DeFi-native Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. This structure allows users to deposit stablecoins and blue-chip assets like ETH and earn passive returns via smart contracts. On the other side of the equation, borrowers will be able to lock collateral‚Äîsay, AVAX or LINK‚Äîat up to 75% LTV and unlock stablecoins like USDC. That balance between capital efficiency and platform integrity is exactly what makes the system appealing to both conservative lenders and active DeFi users. For those seeking higher returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also offer Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality, where users can define their own terms for borrowing and lending. By designing a lending ecosystem that serves both sides of the market, MUTM steps into a category that‚Äôs not only sustainable but also revenue-generating‚Äîsomething few projects in AVAX‚Äôs early days offered. Presale momentum builds as demand rises The interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn‚Äôt just theoretical‚Äîit‚Äôs being confirmed in the numbers. The project is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at just $0.035. More than $14 million has already been raised, and 10% of the 170 million token allocation for this phase is already committed. With a listing target of $0.06, investors entering now are positioning for immediate upside, and those projecting further growth are looking at returns well beyond that. The audit credibility further strengthens confidence. CertiK‚Äôs 95 Token Scan and 78 Skynet scores reflect a project that‚Äôs not only secure but also built with transparency in mind. On the marketing front, the $100,000 MUTM giveaway is driving rapid community engagement, with over 12,000 Twitter followers onboard. These numbers suggest not just hype, but a growing base of holders and backers before the token even hits exchanges. DeFi growth blueprint: from launch to Layer-2 dominance What‚Äôs attracting market analysts is the infrastructure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for post-launch. Upon listing on top known exchanges like Binance, KuCoin and MEXC, the platform plans to launch with a Beta version of its core dApp, giving users immediate access to lending and borrowing functions. But the real edge lies in its Layer-2 integration. This will allow for cost-efficient, high-speed transactions, removing the barriers that slowed DeFi adoption during the last cycle. One analyst, who gained a following for accurately forecasting SOL‚Äôs 2021 run, is now projecting a $2 target for MUTM in the next cycle. His rationale: a clean token model, immediate product-market fit, and a DeFi roadmap that aligns with what serious investors actually want‚Äîcapital growth with real utility. A live snapshot of ROI in the making The performance trajectory for early backers is already notable. One investor who exchanged $5,000 worth of AVAX in Phase 1 for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.01 is now sitting on approximately $17,500, just based on current Phase 6 pricing. With a listing at $0.06, that same position scales to $30,000. And with projections aiming for $2, this investor stands on track for a 200x gain. In a market where large caps like BTC and ETH are showing slower growth, early-stage projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are beginning to draw capital rotation from whales seeking fresh momentum. It‚Äôs a classic cycle shift: from consolidation in majors to growth in high-upside, fundamentally sound assets. Act before the price moves With 90% of Phase 6 tokens still available but a 15% price increase set to kick in at Phase 7, the window for discounted entry is rapidly closing. Just as AVAX surprised early investors in 2021, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now emerging as the token to watch in the upcoming cycle. Smart money doesn‚Äôt wait. It moves before the breakout. As the market begins to rotate and traders hunt for the next narrative, the spotlight is moving toward protocols with real utility, revenue potential, and a clear product vision. That spotlight is now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äîand it‚Äôs only getting brighter.

2025-08-05 06:44:00,49567494,1754376240,"XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Ethereum Named Among Best Altcoins to Buy Before Next Crypto Rally","XRP is once again commanding attention after a sharp move above $3 and a clean break through its $3.60 resistance level. Analysts from multiple platforms, including CoinCentral and Economic Times, point to a potential parabolic rally‚Äîpossibly pushing toward the $10 range by 2027 if ETF developments and regulatory clarity materialize. Tony ‚ÄúThe Bull‚Äù Severino even suggested a 333% surge in just 40 days, citing wave-based patterns that mirror past explosive cycles. Meanwhile, legal progress in Ripple‚Äôs long-standing battle with the SEC is restoring confidence among institutional investors. Traders are watching XRP closely, anticipating a breakout moment as liquidity begins rotating into pre-ETF plays. Ethereum‚Äôs utility keeps it dominant Ethereum continues to serve as the backbone of the blockchain economy. With new staking demand, Layer-2 rollups, and stablecoin integrations on the rise, ETH remains a core holding for both institutions and long-term believers. However, price action has been relatively conservative compared to more speculative altcoins. Analysts expect ETH to retest its previous all-time high sometime in 2026 or 2027, but few see it producing triple-digit returns in the short term. For many, Ethereum functions more like a ‚Äú crypto blue-chip ‚Äù than a high-growth asset. That said, its role as a network anchor is undisputed and continues to shape the broader DeFi and NFT infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation With Ethereum and XRP offering strong long-term prospects, many traders are also turning to smaller-cap opportunities for faster gains . One such name generating intense early momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. While ETH and XRP might require years to deliver 3x or 4x returns , MAGACOIN is being highlighted by analysts for its explosive trajectory, now projecting as much as a 1 4,900% potential ROI, given its early presale stage and viral community growth. Whale wallets have recently begun accumulating large positions, and institutional trackers show increasing mention volume across media platforms. For investors who missed the early days of Ethereum or the first XRP breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being quietly positioned as a way to access those same levels of upside ‚Äì without waiting years . Timing the market‚Äôs next rotation As Bitcoin consolidates and altcoin dominance begins to rise, timing is becoming just as important as coin selection. Projects like XRP and Ethereum remain critical to any balanced portfolio‚Äîbut they may not offer the high-velocity returns some traders seek in shorter cycles. This is why projects with real traction in the early-stage are drawing attention . MAGACOIN FINANCE, in particular, is benefiting from being early, visible, and well-positioned ‚Äì making it a tempting option for those chasing more aggressive gains while still wanting exposure to a growing ecosystem. With market analysts now projecting as much as a 14,900% potential ROI, the timing could be favorable for those entering before major exchange listings.

2025-08-05 06:40:11,49566903,1754376011,South Korean Crypto Exchange Coinone‚Äôs Groundbreaking Digital Asset Sale,"BitcoinWorld South Korean Crypto Exchange Coinone‚Äôs Groundbreaking Digital Asset Sale In a significant development for the digital asset landscape, Coinone, a prominent South Korean crypto exchange , has announced plans for a substantial crypto sale. This move marks a pivotal moment, as Coinone becomes the first among the country‚Äôs top five exchanges to leverage new regulatory frameworks, signaling a new era of operational transparency and financial management within the cryptocurrency sector. Why is Coinone Making This Groundbreaking Coinone Crypto Sale ? Coinone‚Äôs decision to proceed with a Coinone crypto sale stems directly from the need to cover essential operating expenses. This strategic financial maneuver, valued at approximately 4.1 billion won (around $2.95 million USD) based on July 31st closing prices, is designed to ensure the smooth functioning of the exchange and maintain its robust service delivery to users. Specific Assets Involved: The sale includes a diversified portfolio of major cryptocurrencies, carefully chosen to meet their financial objectives: 10 Bitcoin (BTC) 300 Ethereum (ETH) 200,000 XRP 40,000 Cardano (ADA) Purpose of Sale: Funds generated from this digital asset sale are primarily earmarked for critical expenditures such as payroll, administrative overheads, and technology upgrades. This ensures the stability and continuity of the exchange‚Äôs operations, reinforcing its commitment to its employees and users. This proactive step highlights Coinone‚Äôs commitment to responsible financial management within the evolving cryptocurrency market. It also sets a clear example for other exchanges on how to navigate the complexities of operational costs in a highly volatile industry. Navigating the New Korean Crypto Regulations This bold step by Coinone is made possible by recent amendments in Korean crypto regulations . As of June, South Korean regulators introduced provisions allowing crypto exchanges and certain nonprofit entities to sell their proprietary crypto holdings . This regulatory shift represents a crucial acknowledgment of the operational realities faced by digital asset platforms. However, these permissions come with strict conditions, reflecting a cautious yet progressive approach to the burgeoning crypto market. The framework permits such sales only under specific, limited circumstances: Tax Obligations: Exchanges can sell assets to fulfill their tax liabilities. Operational Costs: Funds can be raised to cover essential operating costs, including employee salaries and daily administrative expenses. Default Risk Mitigation: Sales are allowed to address clear risks of default on legal obligations, ensuring financial solvency and protecting stakeholders. These regulations aim to provide exchanges with necessary liquidity for legitimate operational needs while preventing speculative or manipulative sales of their own assets, thereby safeguarding market integrity. What Does This Pivotal Digital Asset Sale Mean for the Market? Coinone‚Äôs proactive approach in initiating this digital asset sale sets a significant precedent for the entire South Korean crypto industry. Being the first among the nation‚Äôs top five exchanges to utilize this regulatory allowance, Coinone demonstrates a strong commitment to operational sustainability and compliance. This move signals a maturing market where regulatory clarity is slowly but surely emerging, fostering greater trust and stability. This development could encourage other exchanges to similarly assess their crypto holdings and leverage the new regulations for financial health. It provides a blueprint for how established platforms can manage their treasuries transparently. The market‚Äôs reaction to Coinone‚Äôs sale will be closely watched, potentially influencing future strategies for other South Korean crypto exchange platforms seeking to enhance their financial resilience. Ultimately, this sale could lead to a more stable and predictable environment for digital asset trading in South Korea, benefitting both exchanges and their users by ensuring continued, reliable service. Coinone‚Äôs strategic Coinone crypto sale represents a significant milestone, not just for the exchange itself but for the broader South Korean digital asset ecosystem. It highlights the growing importance of clear regulatory guidelines that enable exchanges to manage their finances responsibly, ensuring long-term viability and fostering a more secure environment for users.

2025-08-04 20:33:52,49541948,1754339632,Is $BONK Ready to Rally? 3% Rebound Indicates Strong Key Support,"Bonk ($BONK) has bounced back like a spring, recovering 3% after last week‚Äôs dip. With major milestones approaching and key support holding, this meme coin might be gearing up for its next move. The Solana-based token is drawing institutional attention while its ecosystem expands. Now, investors await confirmation that this bounce has legs. Source: CoinMarketCap $BONK Nears 1M Holders: Scarcity, Institutional Interest, and Strategic Burns Drive Value The $BONK token continues to hold its ground as the 46th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $2.12 billion, despite the recent price swing. This is due to optimism and confidence among its community of enthusiasts. Source: SOLSCAN A major catalyst fueling this optimism is $BONK‚Äôs fast-growing user base. With 977,203 holders and counting, the token is edging closer to the anticipated 1 million holder milestone. Once achieved, the project has committed to a massive 1-trillion-token burn , a strategic move to enhance scarcity and strengthen long-term value. Beyond token burns, $BONK is also attracting strong institutional attention. Its inclusion on the Grayscale Q3 2025 watchlist has given the project a new level of credibility. Partnership developments are also boosting the token‚Äôs narrative. $BONK recently announced a collaboration with Dabba Network, allowing underserved communities to purchase internet hotspots using $BONK, portions of which are burned in the process, merging adoption with deflationary mechanics. Dabba x BONK = https://t.co/o6OQWP0m72 ‚Äî BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) April 22, 2025 The broad adoption and interoperability of the $BONK token can be attributed to the integration of the Bonk network with more than 400 applications across 13 blockchains. Another important factor in its development is the network‚Äôs forward-thinking partnership within the Solana ecosystem, linking up with Magic Eden, Jupiter, and Orca platforms to enhance its exposure and liquidity. $BONK Found the Floor? Testing a Key Support Zone! bounce $BONK is currently testing a critical 'Support Area' on the daily chart, precisely between $0.0000024 and $0.0000025. This zone could be the floor for a potential relief rally towards the overhead 'Supply Zone'.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DF6RZYcPYe ‚Äî ùêäùêöùê¶ùê´ùêöùêß ùêÄùê¨ùê†ùê°ùêöùê´ (@Karman_1s) August 3, 2025 Meanwhile, LetsBonk.fun, $BONK‚Äôs official launchpad , dominates the memecoin space on Solana, accounting for about 64% of new meme token launches. It also contributes to BONK‚Äôs deflationary cycle, having already burned over 500 billion tokens through fees. With a rising holder base, deflationary mechanics, institutional interest, and technical support aligning, $BONK appears well-positioned to recover and potentially rally even higher in the near term. $BONK/$USDT Finds Temporary Support at $0.00002390, but Derivatives Unwind Suggests an Uncertain Rebound $BONK has bounced off the key 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002390, following a steady decline from the local high at $0.00004087. The broader trend remains technically intact, but the loss of the ascending support line that guided the move from late June indicates a weakening structure. The $BONK price is currently hovering around $0.00002660, attempting to stabilize above the 0.5 retracement level at $0.00002714. $BONK/$USDT price chart, August 4 (Source: TradingView) However, momentum remains neutral, and there is little evidence of aggressive participation from either side. The RSI reads 48.17, indicating a neutral zone with no immediate strength or weakness. It has ticked upward slightly from the oversold region but hasn‚Äôt shown any bullish divergence or breakout through its midline. MACD reflects a similar picture, though the MACD line has crossed above the signal line; both remain below zero, showing a shallow attempt at recovery without strong momentum. The histogram has just turned green, but volume remains modest, so the signal lacks confirmation. $BONK/$USDT derivatives data August 4 (Source: Coinglass) Regarding Bonk‚Äôs derivatives data, the unwind in open interest is more telling. Open interest is down 4.23% to $37.97 million, suggesting a pullback in speculative activity. That drop follows a period of modest price recovery, which implies that the recent bounce is more driven by short covering or passive buying than by new long positioning. The long/short ratio sits just under 1.0, indicating balanced sentiment overall. OKX shows a slightly higher bias toward longs (1.29), but this is not extreme. Liquidation data shows no major dislocation over the past 24 hours‚Äîjust $65.23K, with most of that coming from short positions. This aligns with the modest up-move off $0.00002400. Still, without strong long liquidations or spikes in funding, the rally lacks the urgency typically seen in reversal setups. For this recovery to extend meaningfully, $BONK must reclaim $0.00002714 and hold above it with volume. That would definitely open the door to a retest of $0.00003038 (the 0.382 level on Fibonnaci), and beyond that, $0.00003439 remains a high-timeframe resistance to monitor. However, if the $BONK price fails to hold strength above $0.00002390, momentum shifts to $0.00001928 and potentially $0.00001711 as deeper retracement zones. Right now, the bounce looks more corrective than impulsive, and bulls must prove their strength with time and volume.

2025-08-04 20:30:24,49563916,1754339424,Peter Thiel‚Äôs Bullish Exchange Files to Go Public: Report,"Crypto trading platform Bullish, backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, has officially started the process to go public in the U.S . The company hopes to be valued at up to $4.23 billion, according to a new filing revealed on August 4, 2025. This shows Bullish is making a fresh move to join the stock market, as more investors are becoming interested in digital assets. This is especially now that America is beginning to set clearer rules for the crypto industry. Bullish Tries Again to Go Public Amid Growing U.S. Support for Crypto As reported by Reuters, Bullish is kicking off its Initial Public Offering (IPO) event, hoping to raise as much as $629.3 million by offering 20.3 million shares priced between $28 and $31 each. If successful, this would mark the company‚Äôs second attempt to go public in just four years. Back in 2021, the exchange tried to go public through a $9 billion SPAC deal, but it was canceled in 2022 due to regulatory challenges. This time, the company feels more confident. This is because the U.S. government is now showing more support for crypto, especially under the President Donald Trump administration. Crypto companies‚Äô confidence and interests are getting stronger, thanks to new crypto clear rules like the GENIUS Act. The newly signed law establishes clear rules for stablecoins and crypto businesses in the U.S., making it easier for them to grow. A Stablecoin Strategy in the Spotlight Bullish has a new plan for its IPO earnings. It wants to turn a large part of it into stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to the U.S. dollar. To do this, Bullish will work with one or more crypto companies that create these tokens. This will give Bullish a stable, blockchain-based reserve. Many crypto firms are now mixing old finance with new digital tools. Bullish‚Äôs idea is similar to what Circle Internet did when it went public this year. In June, it had a strong stock market debut on the New York Stock Exchange and is now trading at over 400% more than its IPO price. Bullish said it plans to list its shares on the stock market under the symbol ‚ÄúBLSH.‚Äù Top financial institutions like J.P. Morgan, Jefferies, and Citigroup set to manage the offerings Bullish Builds Global Footprint With High-Profile Leadership Bullish is not new to the crypto world. It runs a trading platform that is made for big investors, like banks and hedge funds. The platform is fully licensed in the U.S., Germany, Hong Kong, and Gibraltar. The company is led by Thomas Farley. He was once the president of the New York Stock Exchange. Farley brings strong experience from traditional finance into the world of crypto. Bullish also owns the popular crypto media outlet CoinDesk, which it acquired in 2023 from Digital Currency Group , owned by Barry Silbert.

2025-08-04 20:25:50,49541656,1754339150,Nvidia Issues Urgent Patch for Critical Vulnerabilities in AI Triton Server,"Critical AI Flaws Revealed in Nvidia‚Äôs Open-Source Stack Technology giant Nvidia issued a critical piece of software on Saturday to fix severe security vulnerabilities in its open-source AI inference server, Triton. The flaws, if left unpatched, would allow hackers to fully take over servers, steal sensitive data, and make malicious changes to AI model outputs. The weaknesses were discovered by cyber security firm Wiz, which classified them as ‚Äúcritical.‚Äù Nir Ohfeld, Wiz‚Äôs vulnerability research leader, explained the attack method as chaining bugs to use privileges and gain control. The attack starts with a small insect that causes the server to leak out a bit of secret internal data,‚Äù Ohfeld. ‚ÄúFrom there, an attacker can use a legitimate server function to gain control of a private component and ultimately obtain full server control.‚Äù Who Is at Risk? Triton is widely used for deploying and running AI models efficiently on various hardware backends. While Nvidia hasn‚Äôt disclosed its list of clients, industry giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, Siemens, and American Express have been reported to have used Triton in their pipelines. According to Nvidia‚Äôs earlier reports, more than 25,000 companies use Nvidia‚Äôs AI infrastructure, and thus the potential attack surface is quite large. The vulnerabilities are CVE-2025-23319, CVE-2025-23320, and CVE-2025-23334. Nvidia recommended all customers upgrade as quickly as possible to Triton Inference Server version 25.07 or higher, which fixes the entire vulnerability chain. AI and Cybersecurity: A 2025 Trend The Triton disclosure is part of a broader trend in 2025, in which new technologies‚Äîspecifically AI and crypto‚Äîare being attacked ever more intensively by cybercriminals.

The emergence of a double bottom pattern has stirred predictions of a potential uptick. Enthusiasts and investors alike are keen to see if these coins will capitalize on this bullish signal, hinting at imminent growth opportunities. Pendle Price Action: Volatility, Gains, and Key Market Levels Pendle experienced a 19.71% gain over the last month and climbed 42.19% in the past six months, punctuated by short-term dips such as a 9.85% drop in the past week. The price action reveals steady upward movement over longer periods with intermittent corrections. Price fluctuations indicate that while retracements occur, the overall trajectory remains positive, showing strength over time. The coin‚Äôs performance suggests a market that absorbs brief downside pressure while steadily building value, highlighted by its ability to recover and extend gains. The current price sits between $3.17 and $4.96, with the nearest resistance at $5.89 and the closest support at $2.31. Indicators like an Awesome Oscillator at -0.066 and a Momentum Indicator at -0.492 suggest subdued buying energy. An RSI around 46.39 indicates market equilibrium. Bears are slightly dominant, though no clear trend is present. Trading ideas include buying near $3.17 if price stabilizes and observing behavior around the $5.89 resistance, potentially setting profit targets for a breakout toward $7.68. This setup offers opportunities for cautious entries and quick exits near these key levels. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis: Recent Trends and Strategic Levels Over the last month, Arbitrum demonstrated a significant rise of 20.31%, contrasting with a broader decline of 18.33% over the past half-year. This recent increase indicates renewed buying interest, while the extended downturn reflects ongoing bearish sentiment. Price movements indicate a temporary market recovery, but the longer-term decline suggests cautiousness among investors. These trends highlight a coin in a transitional phase, where recent gains haven't fully offset the effects of prolonged bearish performance. Current price conditions reveal key levels worth monitoring. Resistance is observed around $0.60, with a secondary level near $0.80. Support is located at $0.21, with a deeper level at $0.01 serving as a safety net. Bears still exert influence, as noted by the slightly negative Awesome Oscillator and Momentum readings. The RSI near 45 indicates a neutral market position. No clear trend is present, creating a battle between bulls and bears. Traders may consider cautious longs above $0.21 or shorting at resistance while seeking momentum confirmation. Conclusion PENDLE and ARB have met major support levels, hinting at a possible bounce. A double bottom pattern has formed, suggesting potential upward movement. Investors may see these support levels as a positive signal. It could lead to renewed interest and purchasing activity in these coins. Many will watch closely to see if the bounce materializes. If it does, it may offer new opportunities for growth in their value. The next few trading sessions will be crucial for confirming this pattern.

Crucial price targets for Chainlink , Algorand , and Kaspa are key to turning the tide. This article reveals which of these cryptocurrencies are poised for potential growth. Discover strategic insights that could help in making informed decisions amidst downtrends. Chainlink: Six-Month Volatility Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Chainlink posted a swift rebound over the last month with a 25.87% gain despite a 16.97% drop over six months. The coin experienced a substantial weekly dip of 13.58%, reinforcing its volatile nature. Its trading range from $13.01 to $20.54 reflects a market in flux, hinting at both concentrated buying pressure and sporadic sell-offs. Price fluctuations underscore investor uncertainty as the market continues to test liquidity and sentiment levels. Current prices sit within a distinct corridor defined by a key support level at $9.11 and resistance near $24.17. A secondary support at $1.57 and a second resistance at $31.70 suggest potential for drastic moves based on renewed investor interest. Momentum indicators are mixed: while momentum is negative, the Awesome Oscillator shows a slight positive tilt, and the RSI is at 48.61. Traders may consider short-term accumulation near support and selling near the first resistance if upward momentum stalls. A breakout or dip could drive a clearer trend as the global crypto market evolves. Algorand Price Action: Recent Recovery Amid Mixed Signals ALGO moved significantly over the past month, with prices rising by around 40.87%. Over the last six months, it lost roughly 15.61%, indicating a mixed performance. Trading activity has shown volatility and wide swings in sentiment, reflecting a market struggling between temporary surges and longer-term bearish pressures. Price movement has been uneven, highlighted by rapid changes alongside a multi-month downward drift. At current prices, Algorand trades within a range of about $0.16 to $0.33, with key resistance near $0.42 and strong support around $0.08. The one-week decline of 14.10% suggests recent selling pressure, while the neutral RSI of about 48.59 indicates a balance between buyers and sellers. Bears appear to dominate in the very short term, though the positive one-month gain hints at underlying bullish strength. Some traders may consider long positions if prices break above $0.42, while others might wait to see if support at $0.08 holds. Kaspa Trading Dynamics Amid Mixed Trends KAS price experienced a notable upswing of 13.13% over the past month, while facing a 13.32% decline over the last six months. A weekly drop of 18.43% indicates short-term volatility with significant price swings. Recent price action has been mixed, with monthly gains tempered by an overall downward trend in the half-year view, reflecting unpredictable market conditions. The current price situation reveals key levels crucial for trading. Resistance is at $0.14, with initial support at $0.05. The second resistance is at $0.19, while an unreliable second support is at $0.00037. Technical indicators show an RSI of 44.52 and negative momentum, suggesting bearish short-term pressures against a recovering monthly trend. Traders may consider buying near support or setting stop-loss orders around resistance to manage risk effectively. Conclusion LINK , ALGO , and KAS have key price targets to watch. For LINK, aiming for $10 in the near term is reasonable. ALGO might see resistance at $0.35. KAS could test $0.025 shortly. Monitoring these targets can inform investment decisions. Strategic entry and exit points are crucial. Keep an eye on market trends to avoid potential downtrends. Staying informed and adaptable will help in navigating these price movements effectively.

2025-08-04 20:21:30,49542382,1754338890,"Ethereum Price Weakens, But Ethena (ENA) & Hedera (HBAR) Show Power, Will Their Gains Sustain This Week?","Ethereum's value is stumbling , catching the eye of investors. Meanwhile, Ethena and Hedera are gaining momentum, prompting questions about their potential for sustained growth. Which cryptocurrencies are poised for a breakthrough this week? This article dives into the evolving market trends and highlights the tokens to watch. High Stakes Ethereum: Signals for Bull Run and Key Levels Ethereum ‚Äôs performance over the past month has shown a strong resurgence with a 41.51% increase, hinting at renewed investor interest and positive momentum. Over the last six months, the coin gained 29.90%, showing a consistent upward drive despite softer action in the immediate week, where it dropped 8.31%. These figures reveal a coin that has been resilient and capable of significant gains when market conditions favor buyers. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $2,737 to $4,302 with a clear resistance at $4,904 and strong support around $1,774. Traders eye the second resistance at $6,468, providing a target for bullish lifts, while the lower boundary near $209 marks a cautionary level far below current prices. The Awesome Oscillator at 291 suggests lingering strength against downward pull, while the Momentum Indicator at -173 highlights short-term volatility. The Relative Strength Index at 56 shows neutral conditions, allowing for both bullish and bearish plays. Actions within these levels call for careful range trading, observing for breaks above resistance or bounces off support. Ethena: Volatile Surge Amid Mixed Short and Long Term Signals Ethena experienced a striking one-month surge of 138.34% that stands in contrast to a near-flat six-month change of 0.67%. A one-week drop of 8.87% suggests volatility amid the sharp monthly rise. Price movements have been wild recently, with rapid gains not translating into a sustained long-term trend. This dynamic market behavior indicates that explosive monthly jumps may not reflect broader stability when viewed over a half-year period. The current trading range for Ethena spans from approximately $0.312 to $0.764, defining clear boundaries for short-term moves. A strong resistance is near $0.96, with an additional barrier at $1.41, while solid support lies around $0.05. Recent activity shows a one-week decline of 8.87%, adding caution. An RSI near 63 and momentum of 0.01 suggest underlying buying pressure. Bulls have pushed prices higher during strong rallies, yet bears assert control during pullbacks, leaving the overall trend unclear. Trading strategies can focus on breakouts above $0.96 for upward movement while considering potential reversals if this level is not surpassed. Hedera HBAR Price Dynamics: Month Rally with Long-Term Stability Over the past month, Hedera showed a notable surge with a price increase of roughly 62.82%, while the last week experienced a decline of about 14.29%, indicating short-term pressure. Over a six-month period, the coin remained nearly flat with a slight drop of 0.28%, suggesting that longer-term direction has been largely sideways. Price movements during these periods hint at intermittent bursts followed by corrections, with market sentiment reacting to both gains and recent pullbacks. Hedera currently trades within a range of $0.1608 to $0.3236, facing nearest resistance at $0.3958 and secondary resistance around $0.5586, while support stands at $0.0702. Indicators show a balance in market behavior with a neutral RSI reading near 53.82. The Awesome Oscillator presents a modest positive value of 0.0195, though the momentum indicator is slightly negative at -0.0089. This environment sees bulls benefiting from the month-long rise, though recent bearish pressure is present. Traders can look for buying opportunities near the lower range while monitoring resistance for selling or short positions. Active trading within this band is advisable until a clear breakout or drop to support occurs. Conclusion ETH is experiencing a downturn. Meanwhile, ENA and HBAR are showing strong performance. Market trends indicate that their gains may continue this week. ENA's innovative approach and HBAR's growing network could fuel further growth. Analysis suggests these coins have the potential to maintain their upward momentum in the coming days. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On Monday, OpenX submitted an antitrust suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, aligning with an existing action by the Department of Justice. Business Insider reported that the detailed, 88-page complaint alleges that Google has consistently put smaller companies at a disadvantage, effectively preventing them from engaging on equal terms. OpenX says that Google has exploited its commanding market share in digital advertising ‚Äúto rig the rules by which digital advertising is bought and sold, to the detriment of OpenX and the entire industry.‚Äù The complaint argues that these practices have ‚Äústifled innovation, harmed competition, decreased product quality and caused significant damage to OpenX, as well as to Google‚Äôs own publisher and advertiser customers.‚Äù This move by OpenX comes after a notable April decision by Judge Leonie Brinkema, reported by Cryptopolitan. The judge determined that Google unlawfully monopolizes certain ad tech markets . The verdict followed a trial in which the DOJ accused Google of reinforcing its dominance through strategic acquisitions and manipulative auction practices, ultimately finding the company liable for cornering the publisher ad server and ad exchange sectors. Court says Google‚Äôs ad business may be split up Google offers tools for publishers, advertisers, and an ad exchange all in one. The court said that giving Google all three services gives it too much control over ads and could force a breakup of its adtech arm. Google plans to appeal , with a remedies hearing on September 22. OpenX emphasizes its status as a small player, holding just a minimal fraction of the ad exchange market. It claims that Google‚Äôs conduct forced its ad server out of business, leading to its closure in 2019. The complaint added the tricks Google forced publishers to drop OpenX through illegal package deals, rigged auctions so OpenX lost more bids, and secretly funneled ad dollars to its own exchange. ‚ÄúNow that the Court has found Google‚Äôs conduct to be illegal and anticompetitive, this lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the harm caused to us and our shareholders. and to help ensure fair competition going forward,‚Äù said OpenX Chief Executive John Gentry in a statement.

Its market cap now stands at $9.3 billion. Over the past month alone, it increased by 75%, with a weekly jump of 24%. USDe Growth Signals Strong Investor Appetite Since July 18, yield-bearing stablecoin USDe has recorded the largest rise in supply among all major competitors, adding approximately $2.73 billion, according to data from Artemis. This growth surpasses even Tether (USDT), which saw a $2.47 billion rise, and First Digital‚Äôs USDS, which increased by around $1 billion. Other stablecoins like USD Falcon and PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD also saw moderate gains, while USDC recorded the largest decline in supply, dropping by nearly $800 million. This rise aligns with renewed attention on Ethena following the July 21 launch of Stablecoin X, a long-term treasury arm designed to allocate capital across the ecosystem. When the move was announced , Stablecoin X pledged to purchase $260 million worth of ENA, which is approximately 8% of the supply. Alongside this strategic development, the high annualized yield of 11% offered by staked USDe (sUSDe) has significantly increased minting activity. Importantly, Ethena Foundation holds the authority to block any ENA sales made by Stablecoin X, compelling the entity to channel the purchased tokens into reinvestments or infrastructure upgrades. According to Ethena founder Guy Young‚Äôs latest tweet, USDe supply over the past 20 days has outpaced those seen across all BTC ETFs and BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA ETF. Impact on ENA This surge in stablecoin demand appears to have positively influenced the performance of ENA, Ethena‚Äôs native token. After briefly dipping to $0.51 over the weekend, ENA climbed back to around $0.62. The token has surged over 140% in the past month. Its market cap hit $8.4 billion at the end of July before reaching a new all-time high of over $9.4 billion by August 4. At the same time, ENA is starting to show signs of a recovery, hinting at renewed market interest and momentum.

(Nasdaq: VERB) is set to become the first publicly listed company to adopt Toncoin ($TON) as a core treasury asset, following the announcement of an upsized and oversubscribed private placement expected to generate $558 million in gross proceeds. The PIPE (private investment in public equity) deal involves the sale of approximately 58.7 million shares, including pre-funded warrants, priced at $9.51, matching VERB‚Äôs Nasdaq closing price on August 1. The transaction is expected to close on or around August 7, pending standard regulatory and procedural approvals. Verb Technology (Nasdaq: VERB) announced a $558M private placement to launch the first publicly listed Toncoin (TON) treasury strategy company, rebranding as TON Strategy Co. (TSC). Led by Kingsway Capital, the deal attracted 110+ institutional and crypto-native investors.‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 4, 2025 As part of its strategic overhaul, the company plans to rebrand as TON Strategy Co. (TSC) and convert the bulk of the proceeds into Toncoin, the native token of The Open Network. The move indicates a major shift into blockchain-native treasury management and is expected to position the firm among the largest institutional holders of Toncoin worldwide. TON Strategy Co. Bets on Toncoin‚Äôs Future as Telegram-Backed Ecosystem Gains Global Traction Unlike the Bitcoin-centric strategies seen in firms like MicroStrategy or Metaplanet, TSC‚Äôs model is Toncoin-focused, anchored in a growing ecosystem supported by integrations with the messaging platform Telegram and a rising decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Telegram and the TON Foundation recently cemented TON‚Äôs role as the exclusive blockchain for the platform. TON now powers Telegram Ads and tokenized assets like usernames and NFTs, and it is the only network approved for Telegram‚Äôs mini-apps. Integrated directly into the messenger, TON Wallet launched this quarter for 87 million U.S. users, with Telegram boasting over one billion monthly active users worldwide. At press time, Toncoin ranks #33 by total value locked (TVL) on DeFi platforms, holding $155.56 million. Its stablecoin market cap stands at $782.13 million, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week. Additionally, the company stated that its Toncoin holdings will serve as both a store of value and a source of income, generating yield through staking mechanisms designed to be cash-flow-positive over time. At the close of the transaction, the company seeks to retain 77% of the capital raised in liquid assets, allowing it to acquire up to 5% of Toncoin‚Äôs current circulating market capitalization. About 36% of VERB‚Äôs share capital will be subject to a lock-up of six to twelve months. TSC Follows SOL Strategies‚Äô Playbook with Toncoin Bet While TON Strategy Co. (TSC) prepares for its transition into a crypto treasury vehicle, it has affirmed that its core business operations will remain active and are expected to grow alongside its digital asset exposure. The strategy echoes a similar path recently taken by SOL Strategies, which became the first public company to adopt a phased acquisition model centered around Solana. In 2025, the firm raised $500 million via a convertible note to fund its SOL treasury and take part in validator operations. @solstrategies_ files for $1B financing flexibility to capitalize on Solana ecosystem growth through a preliminary base shelf prospectus. #Solana #SOL https://t.co/9JYsJMqfc9 ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 SOL Strategies , formerly known as Cypherpunk Holdings, has evolved into one of the most ambitious institutional validators on the Solana network. The company has accumulated over 260,000 SOL, with roughly 60% staked through institutional validators, yielding between 6% and 8%. Public wallet activity indicates consistent accumulation and a preference for native staking methods, rather than third-party custodians. TSC‚Äôs move to anchor its treasury in Toncoin may indicate a broader institutional shift toward integrating emerging Layer-1 assets with real user bases, particularly those embedded within social platforms like Telegram. Despite the headline-making announcement, Toncoin ($TON) saw a mild setback, falling 3.3% on the day. The pullback comes amid broader market volatility and profit-taking following a recent rally. Still, investor enthusiasm around the treasury initiative appeared firmly intact, at least on the equity side. Shares of Verb Technology Company Inc. (VERB) soared 193.38% on August 4, trading at $27.40 by mid-morning.

The ADA community has just greenlit a $70 million treasury allocation aimed at accelerating the next phase of the blockchain‚Äôs evolution. Over the next 12 months, these funds will support Input Output Global (IOG) in delivering core upgrades focused on scalability, developer tools, and cross-chain interoperability, positioning Cardano to compete more aggressively in the next wave of crypto innovation. The Cardano community just made history. For the first time ever, core development funding has been directly approved by the community ‚Äì ushering in a new era of decentralized governance. Thank you all for your support. This is more than a vote of confidence, it‚Äôs a shared‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Input Output (@InputOutputHK) August 2, 2025 Key initiatives include enhancements to Ouroboros Leios, Hydra scaling, Mithril, Nested Transactions, and Project Acropolis. Collectively, these upgrades make the Cardano blockchain a more attractive platform for building, contributing to a thriving ecosystem and wider use case for ADA as a utility token. The altcoin still suffers under the macro backdrop. The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady in July, awaiting the effects of tariffs, while jobs data underwhelmed. With the ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariff pause now over and higher levies on 92 countries set to take effect August 7, speculators see little chance of a September rate cut, further dulling risk appetite. ADA Price Analysis: Is $10 Now in Focus? With the immediate market-warming effect of the approval, Cardano could find the momentum it needs to continue its bull run with the breakout of a 2-month bull flag pattern. ADA / USDT 4-hour chart, bull flag pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. ADA is currently retesting a key breakout threshold at $0.75, a level that previously served as strong support before flipping into resistance. This comes as momentum indicators lean bullish. The RSI has reclaimed bullish territory above the neutral line at 55, a sign that buyers currently overwhelm sellers. The MACD line remains above the signal line on the 4-hour chart, signalling a short-term uptrend. However, with the histogram flattening out, momentum may be losing steam. A clean break above $0.75 would confirm the bull flag breakout and open the door to reclaim resistance levels at $0.84 and $0.94. Clearing these hurdles, the bull flag sets a breakout target around $1.10, marking a 46% Cardano price gain from current prices. If $0.75 fails, the $0.69 support acts as the last barrier for a deeper correction, eying the start of the flagpole at $0.58‚Äîa real possibility with retaliatory tariffs likely to worsen economic uncertainty. While this puts ADA one step closer to the $10 mark, the timeline remains long. The 12-month development roadmap and onboarding of new builders will gradually increase demand over time. The potential approval of a Cardano spot ETF in October stands as a stronger near-term catalyst, opening the doors to new TradFi demand that could fast-track price discovery.

CryptoInsightUK emphasized this band as a key short-term battleground. XRP briefly dropped to a low of $2.75 before rebounding toward $2.98, indicating buyers are actively absorbing sell pressure within this liquidity pocket. $XRP liquidity, hourly and daily pic.twitter.com/7NcSKPVgiy ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) August 4, 2025 This price zone also coincides with heightened liquidation activity. Notably, over 846% more long positions were liquidated during the past trading sessions, showing a dramatic wipeout of overly aggressive bullish bets. Such a purge may act as a reset, but it also hints at growing short interest looking to exploit any signs of weakness. Daily Liquidity Structure Highlights Larger Moves Ahead Zooming out, the daily liquidity heatmap presents a broader story. Liquidity clusters remain thick from $2.50 to $3.60, with the most significant zones found just above current levels. This indicates resistance in the $3.10‚Äì$3.40 range, but also a potential opportunity: if bulls can reclaim and hold above $3.05, there‚Äôs room for a fast continuation toward $3.60, especially with thinner resistance beyond. Conversely, the daily chart shows notable liquidity voids beneath $2.80. Should the $2.90‚Äì$2.95 range break down, XRP could swiftly revisit lower supports around $2.66 or even $2.47, especially if whales or institutions begin offloading. Current Price Action Confirms the Tension As of report time, XRP trades at approximately $3.01, having clawed back losses after a recent 8% correction from intraday highs near $3.07. That selloff was triggered by sharp volume spikes and a sudden influx of selling pressure, largely attributed to short-term profit-taking and derivatives market overextension. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite the dip, data shows that over 300 million XRP tokens, worth nearly $1 billion, have been pulled off exchanges , pointing to potential accumulation by larger investors. Yet, until XRP can firmly break and hold above $3.10, resistance remains formidable. Technical indicators reflect a fragile equilibrium. The 4-hour moving averages offer mild support around $2.94‚Äì$2.95, while momentum indicators show fading strength unless new volume enters the market. What the Liquidity Says About the Rally CryptoInsightUK‚Äôs liquidity analysis frames the current rally as a make-or-break phase. On the hourly chart, dense liquidity just above the price means shorts could be vulnerable to a squeeze if XRP pushes through resistance. On the daily chart, broader liquidity above $3.00 suggests a possible continuation‚Äîbut only if immediate support zones hold. If bulls lose control, XRP risks a liquidity sweep to lower zones before any renewed push higher. But if buyers hold the $2.90 region and reclaim momentum above $3.05, the path to $3.40‚Äì$3.60 opens up quickly. The hourly and daily liquidity charts, as outlined by CryptoInsightUK, are offering a clear message: XRP is at a crucial technical threshold. Liquidity clusters are signaling potential volatility ahead, with both upside squeezes and downside liquidations in play. For traders and long-term holders alike, the coming days could define whether this rally strengthens or fades.

On Monday, ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone vowed that euro coins and bills will remain at the heart of payments, even as Brussels moves ahead with plans for a state-backed digital euro. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bleed Over $800 Million: Second‚ÄëLargest Exit Ever ‚Äì Details He warned that without a public digital option, privately issued stablecoins could gain too much ground‚Äîespecially in cross-border transfers. ECB‚Äôs Cash And Digital Push According to a blog post by Cipollone, the digital euro will sit alongside physical money, not replace it. He wrote that cash and digital euros, both with full legal tender status, will give consumers more choice. Reports have disclosed that on April 8, Cipollone said a digital euro would curb the rise of foreign-pegged stablecoins in Europe. He added that failing to launch it would leave risks on the table and forgo key opportunities. Cash is indispensable as a way to pay and to store value, says Executive Board member Piero Cipollone. We are modernising banknotes, ensuring they remain accessible and widely accepted. A digital euro will complement this by bringing the benefits of cash to digital payments. ‚Äî European Central Bank (@ecb) August 4, 2025 Private Coins Are Growing Fast Crypto payments are on the rise. Stablecoins now handle many everyday buys and cross-border deals. Data shows that these digital coins often tie to the US dollar and escape strict banking rules. That worries regulators who fear a shift away from the euro. By building its own digital currency, the ECB plans to keep control firmly in its hands. Public Interest Remains Low A working paper published on March 13 found that Europeans aren‚Äôt exactly lining up for a digital euro. When people were asked to split 10,000 euros (about $10,800) among different assets, only a small slice went to the digital version. Cash still dominated. Based on reports, that survey showed nearly all respondents kept most of their mix in coins, bills or traditional bank deposits. Calls For Stablecoin Rules Some analysts say the world needs a stablecoin rulebook, pointing out that strong global coordination is vital to check the power of dollar-pegged coins. Other financial experts agree, highlighting the significance of options like regulated euro-pegged stablecoins, distributed ledger applications and the digital euro itself. Related Reading: Slow And Steady: Bitcoin‚Äôs Current Rise Feels Different‚ÄîStudy By stressing that cash is here to stay, the ECB sends a clear message: innovation must not come at the cost of stability. The plan is to roll out the digital euro in a way that works for all Europeans‚Äîwhether they live in a city with fast internet or a town where ATMs are lifelines.

2025-08-04 20:00:32,49541280,1754337632,"BlockDAG Review: The $361M Presale That‚Äôs Real, Booming, & Built for the Long Haul","In an industry often driven by hype and promises, BlockDAG is taking a different approach: delivering real products, real engagement, and real value ‚Äî all before its token even hits public exchanges. With over $361 million raised, more than 24.3 billion BDAG tokens sold, and a growing ecosystem already in motion, BlockDAG has turned what is traditionally a speculative phase into a full-scale launch experience. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release is set for August 11 , but unlike most early-stage crypto projects, BlockDAG‚Äôs infrastructure is already live. From a demo trading platform to a mobile mining app used by 2.5 million people , the project is proving that a presale doesn‚Äôt have to be about waiting ‚Äî it can be about building, participating, and scaling ahead of schedule. Live Tools Set BlockDAG Apart At the center of BlockDAG‚Äôs early traction is its Demo Trading Platform , a professional-grade interface where users can buy BDAG live at $0.0016 and test selling in demo mode ‚Äî simulating post-launch trading without risk. This isn‚Äôt a preview or a limited beta. It‚Äôs a real platform, giving users a head start ahead of BDAG‚Äôs confirmed $0.05 listing price , which is scheduled to go live later this year across 20+ major exchanges . The trading dashboard is complemented by the X1 mobile miner app , which has attracted over 2.5 million users worldwide . The app gamifies mining, allowing users to simulate daily BDAG rewards that will be credited after launch. This viral tool has become one of BlockDAG‚Äôs strongest growth drivers, onboarding users from diverse markets and creating daily engagement at scale. For those looking to mine BDAG in earnest, BlockDAG has already sold 18,000 ASIC miners , building the foundation of a decentralized network backed by real hashpower. Unlike many modern chains that rely on Proof-of-Stake, BlockDAG is powered by Proof-of-Work , secured by miners, and made scalable through its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture . Hybrid DAG + PoW: Speed with Security BlockDAG‚Äôs technical model is designed to solve blockchain‚Äôs enduring trilemma: how to achieve speed, decentralization, and security all at once. Its answer is a hybrid DAG + PoW architecture that enables parallel transaction processing with real-world throughput between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS . In internal tests, the network has processed up to 10 blocks per second , all while maintaining the trustless validation that PoW provides. Where PoS chains can centralize around large token holders and struggle with validator accountability, BlockDAG‚Äôs distributed mining approach ‚Äî reinforced by ASIC hardware and mobile participation ‚Äî offers resilience. At the same time, its DAG structure supports asynchronous transaction confirmation , meaning BlockDAG is built for speed without sacrificing decentralization . This architecture is already attracting developers. The network is EVM compatible , allowing for seamless migration of Solidity smart contracts, and it features a low-code contract builder to help non-coders deploy dApps. Over 4,500 developers are already building, with 300+ dApps in progress , ranging from DeFi and NFTs to gaming and Web3 utilities. Real Adoption, Not Just Speculation BlockDAG‚Äôs success isn‚Äôt just about tech ‚Äî it‚Äôs about traction. The project now has over 200,000 BDAG holders , a live testnet, and a soon-to-launch Cold Wallet integration that will allow users to store and manage BDAG securely post-launch. BlockDAG‚Äôs brand visibility is also growing rapidly. The project has signed a high-profile partnership with Inter Milan , one of Europe‚Äôs top football clubs, giving BlockDAG a global marketing platform and expanding its reach far beyond crypto-native circles. While many presales rely solely on speculative gains to attract buyers, BlockDAG is offering immediate utility and long-term value . The tools are active, the community is engaged, and the presale is backed by real infrastructure ‚Äî not promises. A Presale That‚Äôs Built, Not Hyped BlockDAG‚Äôs presale is further energized by a 10 BTC Auction Pool. Every BDAG purchase before the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release qualifies for a share of 10 Bitcoin, with larger purchases earning a bigger slice. This incentive has driven a new wave of buyers, accelerating BlockDAG‚Äôs push toward its $600 million presale goal. With a listing price of $0.05 and a presale price of $0.0016, early buyers could see 3025% returns at listing. But analysts are now watching $1 BDAG as a potential mid-term target ‚Äî a 625x ROI from presale levels. If BlockDAG continues its current pace of adoption, $1 isn‚Äôt just speculation ‚Äî it‚Äôs in sight. BlockDAG‚Äôs presale stands out because it‚Äôs real. The tools are live, the user base is massive, and the infrastructure is scaling fast. With $361M already raised , live trading, mining, and user engagement tools, and a clear path to listing, BlockDAG is more than a presale ‚Äî it‚Äôs a launch in motion. As the GLOBAL LAUNCH release nears , BlockDAG isn‚Äôt asking users to wait ‚Äî it‚Äôs inviting them to participate in one of crypto‚Äôs most active and authentic early-stage ecosystems.

Spartans puts its welcome offer front and center: deposit using BTC, ETH, or USDT and get up to 300% more to play with instantly. It‚Äôs not a vague offer buried behind conditions; it‚Äôs real, usable right away across games like blackjack, roulette, and slots. In contrast, Stake‚Äôs bonus often relies on private codes or region-based perks, which means many users miss out. Spartans removes that uncertainty. Everyone is treated equally and gets the same generous bonus, which is exactly what any crypto player expects from their first deposit experience. Daily Reloads at Spartans Are Reliable, Unlike Stake‚Äôs Inconsistent Offers Stake may offer reload bonuses, but their frequency and availability vary. Users often need a particular loyalty rating or time-limited promotion just to qualify. Spartans skips that guesswork entirely. Each day, you can get a 25% bonus on any deposit made, no codes, no alerts, and no dependency on past play history. Regular users especially benefit from this consistency. You don‚Äôt have to climb reward ladders or meet volume targets. Spartans simply give the same reload bonus every day to every user. This dependable system turns occasional gaming into something far more rewarding, and it‚Äôs something Stake doesn‚Äôt provide as a standard feature. Bonus Clarity That Earns Player Confidence Most casinos keep you guessing. Spartans doesn‚Äôt. All bonus terms, like eligible games, time windows, and wagering rules, are easy to find and right where they should be. There‚Äôs no fine print trap. Meanwhile, Stake scatters its rules across different sections, and in some cases applies terms that aren‚Äôt publicly shown, causing confusion about eligibility or delayed rewards. At Spartans, there‚Äôs no such confusion. If you meet the criteria, you‚Äôll get the bonus, and you‚Äôll know it. Clear and consistent rules create confidence, which builds a stronger player base. You won‚Äôt have to email support to confirm anything. The structure is transparent, and the focus remains where it should, on gameplay. To Sum Up Bonuses should be easy to understand and quick to use, not a challenge to claim. Stake‚Äôs approach often pushes users to check their inbox, track specific milestones, or hope they‚Äôre on the right tier. Spartans replaces all that with straightforward rewards you can count on. From the 300% welcome offer to the daily 25% reload, everything is openly stated and equally available. You don‚Äôt have to guess. The perks apply to everyone, and they reflect genuine value. This is why Spartans is setting a new standard for platforms that want to keep users engaged, not puzzled. For crypto users who want rewards that actually deliver, Spartans is proving to be a reliable choice.

Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the price of POL to surge toward $1.57. By 2031, we expect the POL price to record a maximum price of $13.01.

Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, POL. This raises the question: Can POL‚Äôs price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon‚Äôs price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the POL price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is the POL price up today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price faced increased bullish pressure around the $0.235 low. This resulted in a push above $0.24. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025.

POL price prediction August 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in August month. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.16 and a maximum price of $0.25, with an average of $0.22 in July. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction August 2025 $0.16 $0.22 $0.25 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That‚Äôs why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It‚Äôs anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a micro-cap altcoin currently priced at just $0.035, is drawing analyst attention with its unique utility in decentralized lending and real-world asset collateralization. While ETH‚Äôs slow and steady rally continues, Mutuum‚Äôs rapid traction in DeFi circles has prompted some experts to project a possible surge to $7 even before Ethereum reaches its ambitious target. In a market where innovation drives momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming the name traders can‚Äôt ignore. Ethereum‚Äôs Rebound Strengthens Bull Case While Altcoin Shift Gains Traction Ethereum is currently trading at $3,530. Supported above the $3,425‚Äì$3,700 zone, ETH has shown renewed vigor with rising institutional inflows, ETF momentum, and on-chain activity fueling analyst projections of a climb toward $7,000 by the end of 2025. Technical indicators, including an RSI buy signal and widening wedge patterns, support this outlook, though short-term resistance near $3,880‚Äì$4,000 may delay the next leg up if not exceeded. While Ethereum remains central to DeFi‚Äôs infrastructure-led narrative, some attention is now also moving toward emerging utility-driven projects such as Mutuum Finance. Growth in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Activity Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 during stage 6 of presale. The token price will rise by 14.29% to $0.04 in phase 7. The ROI for phase 6 buyers amounts to 71.43% since the token enters the market at $0.06.Mutuum Finance has already surpassed the $14 million in funding. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending Through double models of lending, MUTM users get more freedom and efficiency. Smart contracts are utilized to provide human-less lending within the Peer-to-Contract model. Dynamic interest rates automatically balance the smart contracts to generate high interest rates. Peer-to-Peer architecture excludes middlemen and provides lenders and borrowers with direct access to each other. $50,000 Bug Bounty and Incentives Rolled Out to Boost DeFi Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . There will be 10 winners who will get $10,000 MUTM tokens each. The project has also launched a new top 50 leaderboard of token holders who will be awarded bonus tokens based on their ranks. In order to further strengthen its platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced a Bug Bounty Program for $50,000 in partnership with CertiK. All bugs will be rewarded, and the bounty will be awarded at four tiers, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Ethereum (ETH) could reach $7,000 by 2025, but its gains may come slowly. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at just $0.035 and already gaining speed. The token launches at $0.06, giving current buyers a 71.43% ROI. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.04, so time is limited. The project has raised $14 million+ and attracted 14,800+ investors. With real DeFi utility, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and a $100K giveaway, analysts now see potential for MUTM to hit $7 even before Ethereum (ETH) goes to $7000. Don‚Äôt miss this opportunity.

According to a new Reuters report , the billionaire-backed Bullish is targeting a $4.23 billion valuation for its upcoming US IPO. Bullish reportedly plans to invest many of the IPO funds in US-dollar-backed stablecoins. Bullish plans to offer 20.3 million shares priced between $28-$31, seeking up to $629 million. The news comes on the heels of another Thiel-backed firm, BitMine, announcing that it has accumulated over $3 billion worth of the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, becoming the largest Ethereum ( ETH ) treasury company in the world. The company‚Äôs newly appointed chairman of the board of directors, Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, says that BitMine is well on its way to achieving its goal of acquiring and staking 5% of the total supply of ETH. BitMine seeks to become the MicroStrategy of Ethereum. The software company now known as Strategy already holds 601,000 BTC, worth approximately $72 billion, or around 2.865% of the total supply of the flagship cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúAmong Bitcoin treasury companies, we have witnessed the reflexive benefit of acquiring large holdings‚Ä¶ Such sizable holdings have created a ‚Äòsovereign put‚Äô for the company, meaning a nation-state views MSTR holdings as attractive if a nation ever wanted to acquire 5% of the Bitcoin network.

The billionaire‚Äôs purchase comes as Yuga Labs looks to reinvent itself as the producer of the most valuable items. In an X post Monday, Weitsman announced the purchase of 5,000 NFTs from Otherside collections, including Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas, and Weapon Kodas. The acquisition comes directly from items held by Yuga Labs in an OTC deal. Weitsman also plans to acquire more NFTs on the open market, putting trust in the Otherside ecosystem. Today is a special day for me. I‚Äôm making a long-term investment in Otherside and acquiring over 5,000 Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas and Weapon Kodas direct from @yugalabs to continue building my collection. I have also committed to making a series of acquisitions on the open market‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/I9HeQwNx5k ‚Äî Adam Weitsman (@AdamWeitsman) August 4, 2025 The co-founder of Yuga Labs Wylie Aronow praised the conviction of Weitsman for his readiness to expand his personal collection. ‚ÄúGrateful to have Adam double down as a partner and builder for this next phase of Otherside. No one better to have in our corner ,‚Äù said Greg Solano, co-founder of Yuga Labs. Weitsman will lock the NFT for years, betting on the long-term development of the Otherside metaverse. Yuga Labs focuses on Otherside after selling IP to top collections Yuga Labs was in the process of rearranging its intellectual property, selling CryptoPunks and Moonbirds to third-party curators. The Otherside will be a new area of focus, as gaming and NFTs made a return in 2025. The purchase arrived just days after the Otherside metaverse opened to users and held its first Bubble event and virtual meetup. Yuga Labs owned 10,400 Otherside NFTs, essentially selling nearly half its holdings. Following the announcement, the Otherside collection increased its floor price to a one-month peak of 0.19 ETH. The Otherside collections are relatively minor compared to Punks and Bored Apes, but show a readiness to revive metaverse games and gamified NFTs. Otherside Meta aims to draw big collectors The initial Otherside collections launched years before the expansion of the Yuga Labs metaverse. Some of the items were exclusive and extremely expensive to mint. The Otherside collections may expand in the future, with a large number of items. Yuga Labs aims to reach out to a large audience while also appealing to top whales and collectors. This time around, the collection may be better protected from mint snipers, who front-ran buyers during the original NFT creation. Big collectors are making moves. With Bubbles, Bathroom Blitz, and Otherside Outbreak releasing this month, people are starting to understand the potential of @OthersideMeta ‚Äì community built experiences. It's not just about what Yuga can make, the real story is about what‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/xgaKvClRwZ ‚Äî figge (@mfigge) August 2, 2025 The current slow period for NFTs means Otherside items are traded by a few dozen participants at best. The collections are not inaccessible or rare, with more items and extensions coming in the next few months. Otherside aims to bring back real engagement and revive the 2021 rush to metaverse games. Otherdeeds characters and items are still not clearly linked to their in-game utility. The NFT collections may go through a value discovery period as the game progresses. In the future, the Otherside meta may start to reward players with crypto payments, reviving the play-to-earn model. For now, Yuga Labs draws in a few hundred players for its special events, similar to the early days of on-chain games. The attempt to revive NFT-based gaming after years of almost no activity may be a challenge, as some investors remain skeptical.

2025-08-04 19:44:23,49539933,1754336663,"Hyperliquid, Pump.fun, Conflux Lead August Altcoin Season Mini-Rally ‚Äì Is a Rotation Here?","Talk of an altcoin season has resurfaced in early August , even as the Altcoin Season Index remains below the 75-point threshold. Traders are watching for tokens that combine active ecosystems with liquidity, and three names‚ÄîHyperliquid, Pump.fun, and Conflux‚Äîare coming up in that conversation. While Bitcoin dominance remains above 60%, selective altseason rotations are still putting these tokens in focus. Hyperliquid: Trading Platform Meets Speculation Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to attract attention in derivatives trading. The HYPE price sits around $38 , according to CoinMarketCap, with a market cap near $12.9 billion. Daily trading volume remains steady at nearly $200 million. Although still about 23% off its all‚Äëtime high of $49.86 reached in mid‚ÄëJuly, the project has maintained consistent liquidity. The appeal comes from its Layer‚Äë1 infrastructure, which supports a fully on‚Äëchain order book and zero‚Äëgas perpetual trading. Holders use the token for governance, fee rebates, and trading incentives. With derivatives activity on the rise, Hyperliquid has positioned itself as a token that bridges protocol use and trader momentum. While some analysts question whether the rally has peaked, the steady user base and on‚Äëchain activity suggest HYPE may continue to feature in altseason debates. Pump.fun: Meme Energy for Exchange Liquidity Pump.fun‚Äôs native token, PUMP, has become one of the most discussed Solana‚Äëbased assets in recent weeks. The Pump.fun price is around $0.003, with a $1.05 billion market cap and daily volume above $390 million. Although the token trades 75% below its July peak of $0.01214, its liquidity remains strong. PUMP Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The token is linked to the Pump.fun launchpad, a platform that has powered thousands of meme coin launches. Recent buybacks funded from platform revenue have helped support the market. Analysts say PUMP‚Äôs role is less about deep utility and more about channeling trading energy within Solana‚Äôs meme ecosystem. For traders looking at altcoin season plays, Pump.fun shows how meme‚Äëdriven tokens with real liquidity pools can still attract short‚Äëterm flows. Conflux: A Utility Play in the Mix Unlike the other two, Conflux brings an infrastructure angle. The Conflux price is holding near $0.21 , with a market cap of about $1.09 billion and the 24‚Äëhour volume above $268 million. Circulating supply is just over 5.1 billion CFX. Conflux operates as a Layer‚Äë1 smart contract network using a hybrid Tree‚ÄëGraph consensus. The chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and features low fees through a sponsored gas model. Activity has been rising, supported by DeFi integrations, staking, and cross‚Äëchain bridges. Performance in the past week has been stronger than some peers, suggesting traders may be rotating into CFX as part of selective altseason positioning. Altseason Sentiment Still Cautious The Altcoin Season Index has increased slightly to 44 , meaning Bitcoin is still outperforming most altcoins. Yet, selective gains for HYPE, Pump.fun, and Conflux show that market participants are willing to explore outside the majors when liquidity and activity support the move. For now, this looks less like a broad altcoin season and more like an altseason in pockets. Traders are choosing tokens with active platforms, meme traction, or infrastructure use cases. Hyperliquid, Pump.fun, and Conflux each check one of those boxes, keeping them in rotation as August unfolds.

2025-08-04 19:32:53,49539482,1754335973,$ENA Surges 10% as USDe Supply Jumps 75% ‚Äì Whales Eye Breakout Above $0.68,"Ethena ($ENA) has been grabbing attention for over a month, as it jumped about 10% in the last 24 hours to currently trade at $0.6196 . With USDe‚Äôs market cap rising and new regulated products launching, Ethena‚Äôs synthetic dollar project is gaining momentum. Traders are now asking important questions as they watch whether $ENA can challenge its next resistance level. Source: Coingecko $ENA‚Äôs 140% July Rally: Whales & Institutions Driving Demand Ethena is a crypto-native synthetic dollar protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. Its flagship stablecoin, USDe, uses a delta-neutral strategy (long spot, short futures) to maintain a dollar peg and generate yield via sUSDe, without relying on traditional banking assets. This offers censorship resistance and flexibility but adds complexity and risk if market dynamics change. $ENA is the governance/utility token of the Ethena network, with the maximum supply being 15 billion tokens. Circulating supply and rich-list dynamics suggest a relatively distributed holder base, according to Etherscan . Additionally, USDe‚Äôs market cap has surged 75% within a month, with recent reports showing it has eclipsed $9.29 billion. This makes it the third-largest stablecoin by supply and drives capital inflows into the protocol. That explosive growth fed directly into $ENA‚Äôs narrative: the governance token rallied strongly, gaining between 140% and 155% in July while weekly trading volume surged to approximately $1.41 billion and open interest climbed about 30%. ENA rally heats up: Ethena surged 155% in July and added another 14% this week as trading volume and futures interest spiked. But with the price dipping below key support at $0.55, $0.49 now stands as the crucial level to watch. #ENA #Crypto https://t.co/QtN7fIrdZZ ‚Äî TWJ News (@TronWeekly) August 3, 2025 That institutional move was amplified when Arthur Hayes publicly committed roughly $1.06 million to $ENA in late July, sparking an immediate price reaction. Whale behavior mirrored institutional interest, with large holders accumulating some 79.25 million ENA in a single week. Additionally, Ethena partnered with federally regulated Anchorage Digital to issue USDtb, billed as the first U.S. GENIUS Act‚Äìcompliant stablecoin, introducing a regulated onshore dollar product alongside its more experimental USDe. According to DeFiLlama data, the total value locked (TVL) of the $ENA token is over $9.5 billion , ranking it among the top six DeFi protocols as of early August 2025. On-chain analytics also indicate growing adoption, and a large percentage of $ENA tokens are held by large whales, indicating commitment from the big players. If trends persist with growing USDe adoption, USDtb-driven regulatory clarity, and strong whale confidence, analysts project $ENA could reach between $1.00 and $1.50 by year-end, with higher targets possible if the ecosystem expands further. $ENA Tests $0.68 Resistance Again After Rounded Retest From $0.54 Base $ENA is making another approach toward the $0.68 resistance level after completing a rounded retest pattern that began forming following last month‚Äôs rejection . This level capped the price during the previous rally, which was fueled by an 18% price jump tied to wallet activity from large investors like Arthur Hayes and sharp increases in derivatives positioning. $ENA/$USDT price chart, August 4 (Source: TradingView) That move carried $ENA/$USDT from a base near $0.54 to a high of $0.6864 before momentum faded into supply. The current climb back to this zone unfolds more gradually and with less visible leverage, creating a structurally healthier setup. The 4-hour chart shows a clearly defined rounded retest, with price curling higher off the $0.54 low and maintaining higher lows throughout. Volume during the climb has been consistent, though no breakout influx has occurred yet. This helps distinguish the current advance from the earlier parabolic move, which was accompanied by funding spikes and liquidation clusters. The market structure remains intact above the trendline, and the bias remains to the upside so long as price holds above $0.61 on intraday pullbacks. The 30-minute footprint chart offers more nuance. From $0.6060 up through $0.6180, volume is fairly distributed, but the delta profile reveals sporadic selling into strength. A sequence of three consecutive red deltas from 08:00 to 09:30 UTC totaled more than -5.7 million, despite average-sized candles. That points to passive sellers still present in the region. However, bulls have managed to hold the price firm above $0.6160 despite that resistance, suggesting either absorption or fatigue on the sell side. This retest of $0.68 comes without the crowded long positioning that characterized last week‚Äôs breakout attempt. Derivatives data earlier this week showed excessive long exposure with a top-heavy long/short ratio, particularly on Binance and Bybit. That has since normalized, reducing the risk of liquidation-driven retracements. If the bulls can reclaim $0.662 and push through $0.684 on volume, the previous high at $0.6864 becomes vulnerable again. On the other hand, failure to do so, especially if the delta turns sharply negative again near resistance, may result in a local double top, leading to a price drop. Until then, the trend remains constructive, with the market waiting to see whether the supply wall at $0.68 has weakened since the last test.

2025-08-04 19:28:25,49544203,1754335705,5 Coins Under $0.40 Predicted to Eclipse Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) With 6000% Gains in 2025,"As of writing, Cardano trades at $0.78, while Solana sits at $180.50. Both projects are positioned for notable gains in 2025, with ADA projected to rise as high as $2.36 (a ~200% increase) and SOL aiming for a mega-bullish peak of $395, potentially doubling current levels. Yet despite these projections, a new wave of low-cap altcoins under $0.40 is gearing up to deliver even greater returns‚Äîand some analysts believe they could outperform the likes of Cardano and Solana with 6000%+ surges by year-end. Below, we break down 5 coins under $0.40 with explosive potential in 2025, starting with a meme-fueled Layer-2 juggernaut turning heads across the crypto space. Little Pepe (LILPEPE)‚ÄîThe Meme King of 2025 Current Presale Price: $0.0018 Listing Price: $0.003 Target: $0.09+ (5000% Surge) Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the rising prince of meme coins‚Äîand the most talked-about presale of 2025. Unlike typical meme tokens, LILPEPE combines viral meme culture with real utility by launching its own Layer-2 blockchain that boasts ultra-low gas fees, lightning-fast finality, and seamless Ethereum compatibility. As of writing, LILPEPE is in Stage 9 of its presale, with over $13.8M raised out of a $16.47 million target and nearly 10 billion tokens already sold. The project has recently been listed on CoinMarketCap, signaling rising legitimacy and growing investor confidence. LILPEPE‚Äôs unique zero-tax structure, presale vesting schedule, and robust tokenomics make it both a long-term play and a short-term breakout candidate. With whale interest evident from large presale purchases and social traction exploding on platforms like X and Telegram, many believe LILPEPE could deliver a 5,000% to 6,000% return once it launches at $0.003 and rallies toward the projected $0.09 mark. Adding more heat to the hype is the ongoing $777,000 giveaway , where ten lucky participants will win $77,000 worth of LILPEPE each. With over 161,000 entries already, it‚Äôs clear the community is all-in. Cronos (CRO)‚ÄîUndervalued L1 With AI-Driven Growth Current Price (as of writing): $0.1435 2025 Target: $0.354 Cronos (CRO), the native token of Crypto.com‚Äôs blockchain, has recently gained bullish traction. The token rebounded from key support near $0.136 and now trades around $0.1435. Analysts predict a move toward $0.306‚Äì$0.354 by the end of 2025, up to 146% from current levels. The catalyst? Strong ecosystem development, a strategic partnership with Theta Network, and growing AI integrations within Cronos-based dApps. According to CoinPedia and CoinCodex, this consistent utility-driven growth makes CRO one of the most undervalued large-cap tokens under $0.20. Hedera (HBAR)‚ÄîEnterprise-Grade Blockchain With a Bullish Reversal Current Price (as of writing): $0.26 2025 Target: $1.20 HBAR continues to attract attention from institutional players, and recent technical indicators suggest a potential breakout. With its hashgraph consensus and enterprise adoption (including partnerships with Google and IBM), Hedera stands as a serious contender to Ethereum alternatives. From its current price of $0.26, HBAR could soar to $1.20 by the end of 2025, representing a 361% return in a bullish scenario. Reddit analysts and StealthEX see it as a stealth altcoin capable of major rallies as on-chain volume spikes and accumulation increases. TRON (TRX)‚ÄîStablecoin Powerhouse With Hidden Strength Current Price (as of writing): $0.336 2025 Target: $0.48 TRON has flown under the radar, but don‚Äôt let the silence fool you. It now hosts over $80B in USDT volume, surpassing Ethereum in stablecoin transactions. Following its $100M Nasdaq reverse merger, TRON now sits in the top 10 by market cap. Analysts have made bullish predictions for TRX, stating a price of $0.43‚Äì$0.48 in August 2025, translating to a 40‚Äì50% gain. Suppose TRON continues expanding into the DeFi space and maintains its lead in stablecoin transaction volume. In that case, it can reach even higher milestones, especially if it manages to reclaim its all-time high of $0.45+. Dogecoin (DOGE)‚ÄîStill the People‚Äôs Coin Current Price (as of writing): $0.2215 2025 Target: $0.70‚Äì$0.91 DOGE may be a legacy memecoin, but it‚Äôs not done yet. Despite a slight 24-hour dip, bullish patterns like weekly engulfing candles and strong whale support point to renewed upside momentum. In a best-case scenario, DOGE could reach $0.70 - $0.91 by the end of 2025, indicating a 3x ‚Äì 4x increase. Bitget and TokenMetrics have also made positive projections, suggesting a DOGE rally following mainstream hype circuits, especially if the rest of the crypto market performs well. Conclusion: The Under-$0.40 Gems Ready for Liftoff Cardano and Solana remain respected pillars in the crypto world, but investors searching for explosive gains in 2025 should watch the under-$0.40 zone closely. From Hedera‚Äôs enterprise adoption to Cronos‚Äô AI expansion and TRON‚Äôs stablecoin dominance, these altcoins are building strong foundations for growth. But above them all stands Little Pepe (LILPEPE)‚Äîthe meme-turned-monarch leading a Layer-2 revolution. With whale interest, real blockchain utility, zero-tax trades, and a vibrant community, LILPEPE isn‚Äôt just another token. It‚Äôs a movement. And with projections suggesting a 5000%+ surge, the presale may be the last chance for investors to get in before the rocket ignites.

2025-08-04 09:26:24,49524787,1754299584,XRP Rich List Update Reveals How Much You Need Now to be Among Top 10% and Top 1%,"The latest update of the XRP rich list shows that while the amount of XRP tokens necessary to reach the top 10% and top 1% has reduced, the capital for acquiring these tokens has increased. Notably, this is largely due to XRP's impressive surge in recent times, as it rallied with the broader crypto market to reach new yearly highs. For context, XRP soared rapidly to a peak of $3.66 in late July before pulling back as July came to a close. Despite the pullback, XRP still holds above $3, up 32% in the past month.Amid the recent price movements, data from the community-driven XRP rich list resource shows that the amount of XRP tokens you need to hold as an individual to become part of the top 10% and the top 1% has dropped considerably.¬†XRP Needed to Enter Top 10% and Top 1% of the XRP Rich ListIn contrast, the capital with which new entrants could procure these tokens has increased. Specifically, data shows that investors who hold at least 2,433 XRP are now part of the top 10% on the XRP Rich list. Notably, only about 679,990 accounts hold up to this amount, representing 10% of the total 6.799 million XRPL wallets.Interestingly, the amount of XRP necessary to enter the top 10% was relatively higher nearly a month ago when The Crypto Basic provided an update on the XRP rich list at the time. Specifically, on July 7, investors needed to hold at least 2,486 XRP to be part of the top 10.¬†At the time, the 2,486 XRP were worth $5,643. Today, while they need 2,433 XRP to hit the top 10%, the tokens are worth $7,299. This represents an increase of nearly $2,000 to enter the top 10 in less than a month despite the number of tokens seeing a drop.This trend also prevailed across other tiers of addresses within the XRP rich list. For instance, on July 7, one needed to hold 8,758 XRP worth $19,880 to be part of the top 5%. Today, the investor would have to possess 8,517 XRP, currently worth $25,551, to enter this tier, an increase of over $5,000. XRP Rich List XRP Rich List Interestingly, one of the most drastic changes occurred with the top 1% tier. At the time of the previous XRP rich list report, investors looking to enter this tier required 50,637 XRP valued at around $115,000 then. Now, while investors would need to hold 50,108, they would have to spend $150,000, an increase of more than $35,000.Market Still Early?Analysts argue that this consistent change indicates that investors who continue to put off investing in XRP would only be able to afford less for more as the market matures. Market pundit Edoardo Farina called attention to this trend in June, when he suggested that XRP was pricing out retail investors.Moreover, several community commentators have insisted that investors who enter the market today are still incredibly early. This is because they expect XRP to surge beyond current levels. For context, if XRP hits the $30 price projected by EGRAG , the 2,433 tokens needed to enter the top 10% would be worth nearly $73,000.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,1,latest update xrp rich list show amount xrp token necessary reach top top reduced capital acquiring token increased notably largely due xrp impressive surge recent time rallied broader crypto market reach new yearly high context xrp soared rapidly peak late july pulling back july came close despite pullback xrp still hold past recent price movement data xrp rich list resource show amount xrp token need hold individual become part top top dropped considerably xrp needed enter top top xrp rich listin contrast capital new entrant could procure token increased specifically data show investor hold least xrp part top xrp rich list notably account hold amount representing total million xrpl amount xrp necessary enter top relatively higher nearly month ago crypto basic provided update xrp rich list time specifically july investor needed hold least xrp part top time xrp worth today need xrp hit top token worth represents increase nearly enter top less month despite number token seeing trend also prevailed across tier address within xrp rich list instance july one needed hold xrp worth part top today investor would possess xrp currently worth enter tier increase xrp rich list xrp rich list interestingly one drastic change occurred top tier time previous xrp rich list report investor looking enter tier required xrp valued around investor would need hold would spend increase still early analyst argue consistent change indicates investor continue put investing xrp would able afford less market matures market pundit edoardo farina called attention trend june suggested xrp pricing retail several community commentator insisted investor enter market today still incredibly early expect xrp surge beyond current level context xrp hit price projected egrag token needed enter top would worth nearly,0.007,0.721,0.272,0.997,1
2025-08-04 09:25:10,49515281,1754299510,Bitcoin buying opportunity: Kiyosaki‚Äôs Strategic Play for a Potential Price Dip,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin buying opportunity: Kiyosaki‚Äôs Strategic Play for a Potential Price Dip In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, few voices resonate as widely as Robert Kiyosaki, the acclaimed author of ‚ÄòRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äô. Known for his unconventional financial wisdom, Kiyosaki has once again captured the attention of investors with a bold declaration: he plans to significantly increase his Bitcoin (BTC) holdings if its price falls below $90,000 this month. This isn‚Äôt just a casual observation; it signals a potential Bitcoin buying opportunity that many long-term holders might consider. Kiyosaki‚Äôs stance highlights a crucial aspect of investing: viewing market corrections not as setbacks, but as chances to acquire assets at a lower cost. His insights often challenge traditional financial paradigms, encouraging individuals to think differently about wealth accumulation and asset protection. For those navigating the volatile crypto landscape, understanding this perspective can be key to unlocking long-term gains. Why is Robert Kiyosaki Eyeing This Bitcoin Buying Opportunity ? Kiyosaki‚Äôs investment philosophy is deeply rooted in a critical view of conventional finance and government policies. He believes the true issue isn‚Äôt Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, but rather the systemic weaknesses within the traditional financial system. His concerns are primarily directed at two major factors: U.S. National Debt: Kiyosaki frequently points to the escalating U.S. national debt as a looming crisis. He argues that such massive debt levels will inevitably lead to inflation and currency devaluation, making assets like Bitcoin a superior store of value compared to fiat currency. Leadership at the Federal Reserve and Treasury: He often expresses skepticism about the leadership and policies of the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury. He views their actions as contributing to economic instability, further solidifying his belief in decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against governmental mismanagement. For Kiyosaki, a dip in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, even a significant one, is merely a symptom of a broader economic landscape he perceives as fragile. This outlook frames any potential price drop as a strategic moment to reinforce one‚Äôs position in an asset he considers foundational for future wealth. Does August Really Present a Bitcoin Buying Opportunity ? Kiyosaki specifically mentioned August as a potential month for a price drop, noting Bitcoin‚Äôs historical performance during this period. While past performance does not guarantee future results, examining historical trends can offer perspective. August has indeed shown mixed results for Bitcoin, often exhibiting weakness or consolidation after stronger performances in previous months. Let‚Äôs look at some historical August performance figures for Bitcoin: Year August Performance 2023 -11.20% 2022 -14.60% 2021 +13.30% 2020 +3.60% 2019 -4.10% 2018 -9.90% As the table shows, August has frequently been a challenging month for Bitcoin, with several instances of negative returns. This historical context aligns with Kiyosaki‚Äôs anticipation of a potential dip, making his readiness to capitalize on a Bitcoin buying opportunity even more relevant. What Does a Bitcoin Buying Opportunity Mean for Investors? For long-term investors, a significant price drop can be a moment of excitement rather than panic. This perspective is central to Kiyosaki‚Äôs approach. Here‚Äôs why such an event can be beneficial: Accumulation at a Discount: A lower price allows investors to acquire more Bitcoin for the same amount of capital. This increases their total holdings, positioning them for greater gains when the market eventually recovers. Strengthening Long-Term Position: For those who believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamental value and its role as a future store of wealth, dips offer a chance to strengthen their long-term portfolio without chasing higher prices. Psychological Advantage: Successfully navigating a dip by buying more can build investor confidence and reinforce a disciplined investment strategy, rather than reacting emotionally to market swings. Kiyosaki‚Äôs willingness to double down on his investment reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs future, irrespective of short-term price movements. He views these moments as gifts for those with a long-term vision. How Can You Prepare for a Potential Bitcoin Buying Opportunity ? While Kiyosaki‚Äôs strategy is clear, individual investors need to approach such opportunities with their own financial situation in mind. Here are some actionable insights to consider if you wish to prepare for a potential Bitcoin buying opportunity : Have a Clear Strategy: Define your entry points and the amount you are willing to invest during a dip. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the absolute bottom, consider implementing a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset‚Äôs price. This approach can smooth out the impact of volatility and reduce the risk of buying at a peak. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and while a bounce back is often expected, there are no guarantees. Research and Education: Continuously educate yourself about Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and macroeconomic trends. Understanding the underlying fundamentals strengthens your conviction during periods of uncertainty. Secure Your Holdings: If you plan to accumulate more Bitcoin, ensure you have a secure storage solution, such as a hardware wallet, to protect your assets. Kiyosaki‚Äôs readiness to act is a testament to his preparation and conviction. For investors, this means having a plan in place before the market moves, not after. Beyond the Dip: Kiyosaki‚Äôs Vision for the Future of Bitcoin Buying Opportunity Kiyosaki‚Äôs consistent advocacy for Bitcoin goes beyond just trading strategies; it‚Äôs part of a broader philosophy on financial independence and protection against what he perceives as a failing monetary system. He sees Bitcoin as a form of ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs money‚Äù that is immune to government manipulation and inflationary policies. His desire for a price crash is not rooted in malice, but in a genuine wish to see more people gain access to what he considers a vital asset for future prosperity. His views align with a growing sentiment among investors who are seeking alternatives to traditional assets in an era of unprecedented debt and economic uncertainty. The concept of a Bitcoin buying opportunity , therefore, extends beyond a simple trade; it embodies a strategic shift towards decentralized finance as a safeguard for wealth. In conclusion, Robert Kiyosaki‚Äôs readiness to double his Bitcoin holdings if the price dips below $90,000 this August is a strong signal for the crypto community. It underscores the potential for market corrections to serve as strategic accumulation phases for those with a long-term vision. His insights remind us that true wealth building often involves going against the prevailing sentiment, seeing opportunity where others see fear. As the crypto market continues its journey, Kiyosaki‚Äôs bold moves offer a compelling case study for disciplined, conviction-driven investing. Remember, while Kiyosaki‚Äôs advice is insightful, it is crucial to conduct your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

A new challenger is making waves: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . With its presale nearing completion at Stage 8, and a staggering 97.94% of tokens already sold, the hype surrounding LILPEPE is reaching a boiling point. With analysts predicting a 5,000% surge within just three months, LILPEPE is now being touted as the next big thing, potentially even eclipsing Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) in terms of raw returns and ecosystem utility. Meme coin with a mission: why Little Pepe is different What sets LILPEPE apart from the dozens of daily meme coin launches? The answer lies in its foundational utility. While most meme coins are content riding on community hype alone, LILPEPE is building something more sustainable: a Layer-2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins. This isn‚Äôt just a buzzword-laced promise. LILPEPE is constructing a high-speed, low-fee chain to serve as a launchpad for other meme coins. This approach offers multiple advantages: Zero Gas Fee: Transactions on the LILPEPE chain will be the cheapest among its peers. Anti-Bot Infrastructure: LILPEPE is the only chain where sniper bots won‚Äôt work, eliminating one of the biggest threats to fair presales and launches. Launchpad for Meme Projects: Creators can launch their tokens and communities directly on the LILPEPE chain with plug-and-play tools. Community First, Always: LILPEPE charges zero tax on trades, ensuring a frictionless experience for developers and traders alike. Current presale metrics point to massive demand With $13,433,854 raised out of the $13,775,000 Stage 8 cap and 9.55 billion tokens sold, Little Pepe‚Äôs presale is almost fully subscribed. The current price of $0.0017 will soon rise to $0.0018 in the next stage, suggesting that buyers still have a very small window of opportunity before prices increase again. This kind of frenzied buying activity signals high investor confidence. Retail and institutional participants are scrambling to accumulate before the token lists on two top-tier centralised exchanges (CEXs), with whispers circulating of a potential future listing on the world‚Äôs biggest exchange. Why analysts believe LILPEPE could 50x by year-end While the figure sounds ambitious, several compelling factors back the 5,000% price prediction: Ultra-Low Initial Valuation: With a presale price under $0.002 and a meme-first branding, LILPEPE is still under the radar for many mainstream traders. Massive Scarcity Post-Presale: Out of the 100 billion total supply, only 25 billion tokens are allocated to presale buyers. This ensures tight post-launch supply and a high likelihood of a supply shock once it hits exchanges. Built-In Utility on Day One: Unlike SHIB and PEPE, which started with hype before finding use cases, LILPEPE will launch with a working blockchain infrastructure that supports real applications. Anonymous Founders With Proven Track Records: The team behind LILPEPE includes crypto veterans responsible for top-performing meme coins. Although these individuals are anonymous, the remarkable narratives of their achievements are self-evident. LILPEPE fuses two of crypto‚Äôs most popular brands‚ÄîPepe the Frog and the ‚ÄúLil‚Äù trend of hip hop and meme culture‚Äîyielding a memeable token and easily shareable. Viral Branding potential is obvious. SHIB and PEPE have set the bar‚Äîcan LILPEPE leap over it? Shiba Inu was dubbed the ‚ÄúDogecoin killer‚Äù in its early days. At its peak, SHIB delivered over 100,000% in returns, helping countless early adopters become overnight millionaires. PEPE, too, had its moment of glory in 2023, drawing in thousands of traders and igniting a resurgence of meme-based investing. However, both tokens face challenges: SHIB‚Äôs burn rate recently crashed by 93%, raising questions about its long-term scarcity narrative. PEPE lacks utility, making it heavily reliant on sentiment-driven pumps. In contrast, LILPEPE combines utility, scarcity, and meme culture in a way that neither SHIB nor PEPE did at launch. This positions it as a new-era meme coin that doesn‚Äôt need to choose between hype and substance. Listing plans and what‚Äôs coming next Little Pepe isn‚Äôt waiting for the market to find it. The team has confirmed that the token will be listed on two major centralized exchanges immediately after the presale ends. Given the nearly sold-out status of Stage 8, this moment is coming very soon. Additionally, rumours are circulating that LILPEPE is in the early stages of discussion with the biggest crypto exchange in the world. If true, such a listing would send LILPEPE into the stratosphere, exposing it to millions of new users and turbocharging its market cap. Final thoughts: a rare window of opportunity Crypto doesn‚Äôt offer many second chances, but LILPEPE might be one of them. With nearly all tokens in Stage 8 sold, the opportunity to secure a position at $0.0017 is closing fast. For those who missed the early days of SHIB or PEPE, Little Pepe represents the next best shot at catching a meme coin before it explodes. If it fulfils even half of its utility roadmap and secures its planned exchange listings, a 5,000% surge by year-end is not just plausible‚Äîit may be conservative.

2025-08-04 09:19:24,49515026,1754299164,France‚Äôs Far-Right Party Plans Bitcoin Mining with Nuclear Power After Years of Crypto Opposition,"France‚Äôs far-right Rassemblement National party has proposed using surplus nuclear energy to mine Bitcoin, which marks a dramatic reversal from Marine Le Pen‚Äôs 2016 promise to ban virtual currencies. According to Le Monde , the plan involves installing mining computers at state-owned EDF nuclear facilities to generate Bitcoin from excess reactor capacity, positioning the far-right as France‚Äôs most vocal crypto advocates. Le Pen announced the mining proposal during a March visit to the Flamanville nuclear power plant, arguing the strategy would monetize surplus electricity rather than waste energy. The Flamanville EPR Source: WNN RN lawmaker Aur√©lien Lopez-Liguori was tasked with drafting legislation supporting the initiative, calling it ‚Äúa secure and extremely profitable solution‚Äù that contrasts with the Green Party‚Äôs opposition to energy production. The political shift coincides with a wave of violent crypto-related kidnappings targeting French entrepreneurs, including attempted abductions of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat‚Äôs family and the brutal kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland. These incidents have prompted calls for stronger security measures and influenced crypto executives‚Äô political allegiances toward parties promising stricter law enforcement. Political U-Turn Reflects Opportunistic Strategy on Digital Assets The RN‚Äôs cryptocurrency evolution spans nearly a decade of contradictory positions. In 2016, Le Pen denounced Bitcoin as a tool of the ‚Äúruling elite‚Äù and ‚ÄúWall Street investment banking lobby,‚Äù promising outright prohibition. By 2022, her stance softened to supporting regulation rather than bans. Internal party tensions remain over the crypto pivot. Jean-Philippe Tanguy, RN‚Äôs finance expert and vice president of the National Assembly group, warned against ‚Äúthe return of economic lords‚Äù and emphasized state monetary policy control. His opposition to currency independence directly contradicts Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational philosophy of eliminating banking intermediaries. Despite internal doubts, several RN officials are considering opening the party‚Äôs promised ‚Äúsovereign wealth fund‚Äù to Bitcoin investments. Sarah Knafo, European Parliament member from the allied party Reconqu√™te, has repeatedly praised Bitcoin in Strasbourg while citing authoritarian leaders like Donald Trump and Nayib Bukele as models. The far-right has filled a political vacuum on crypto issues. French left-wing parties remain focused on environmental concerns and money laundering risks rather than individual freedom aspects. This positioning allows the far-right to claim crypto advocacy by default. Crypto Executive Violence Drives Political Realignment French crypto entrepreneurs face escalating physical threats, fundamentally altering their political calculations. Paris prosecutors have recently charged 25 suspects in May following multiple kidnapping attempts targeting industry figures and their families. The cases involved severed fingers, ransom demands reaching ‚Ç¨7 million, and attackers disguised as delivery drivers. Pierre Noizat‚Äôs family narrowly escaped abduction near a Paris school when assailants posed as Chronopost couriers. Following the incident, Noizat appeared on BFM-TV denouncing France‚Äôs ‚ÄúMexicanization,‚Äù ‚Äúobese state,‚Äù and immigration policies in interviews widely shared by far-right influencers. With a powerful sweep, Paris authorities charged 25 suspects, including six minors, cracking down on a surge of violent crypto abductions shaking the city‚Äôs streets. #CryptoKidnap #France https://t.co/P3F5Wz2GNl ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Ledger founder Eric Larchev√™que, after his abduction in January , publicly embraced the ‚Äúliberal libertarian model of Trump and Musk,‚Äù calling for Europe to ‚Äútake out the chainsaw‚Äù like Argentina‚Äôs Javier Milei. Larchev√™que has made appearances with RN allies Eric Ciotti and Eric Zemmour. The violence extends beyond France. Global crypto kidnappings surged in 2025, with incidents in Argentina, Canada, the United States, and the UK courts sentencing gang members for crypto-related torture and extortion. French cases stand out for their brutality and family targeting. Bitcoin representatives acknowledge their sector‚Äôs politicization while lamenting the left-wing absence from crypto debates. Alexandre Stachtchenko of Institut National de Bitcoin cited in the report that France‚Äôs ‚Äúcult of centralism‚Äù and reflexive suspicion of non-state initiatives are driving crypto advocates toward the far-right. Looking forward, the RN‚Äôs nuclear mining proposal faces practical hurdles despite political momentum. France‚Äôs regulatory framework requires extensive consultation with exchanges, financial authorities, and underwriters before implementation. The party has not commenced required stock exchange consultations for potential crypto asset listings, and success remains uncertain given France‚Äôs historically cautious approach to digital assets.

2025-08-04 09:15:10,49514848,1754298910,US Dollar Plunge: Crucial Fed Rate Cut Looms After Weak Payrolls,"BitcoinWorld US Dollar Plunge: Crucial Fed Rate Cut Looms After Weak Payrolls The recent sharp decline in the US Dollar has sent ripples across global financial markets, including the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding these macro shifts is paramount, as a weaker dollar often correlates with increased appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. The catalyst? Surprisingly weak payroll data that has intensified speculation about an impending Fed rate cut . What does this mean for your portfolio and the broader economic outlook ? Why is the US Dollar Experiencing a Significant Decline? The immediate trigger for the US Dollar ‚Äòs recent retreat was the release of softer-than-expected US jobs data. This crucial economic indicator, closely watched by market participants and policymakers alike, painted a picture of a cooling labor market. The non-farm payrolls report, in particular, came in significantly below forecasts, suggesting that the robust job growth seen in previous months might be losing momentum. This development has profoundly impacted currency markets, leading to a notable weakening of the greenback against major global currencies. Key data points that contributed to this sentiment include: Non-Farm Payrolls: The headline number for new jobs created fell well short of expectations, indicating a slowdown in hiring across various sectors. Unemployment Rate: While still historically low, a slight uptick in the unemployment rate further supported the narrative of a loosening labor market. Wage Growth: Slower wage growth also played a role, suggesting reduced inflationary pressures from the labor side. This confluence of data points has led traders and investors to reassess their expectations for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy trajectory, directly influencing the dollar‚Äôs valuation. Understanding the Impact of Weak Payrolls Data The significance of weak payrolls data cannot be overstated. For the Federal Reserve, employment figures are a cornerstone of their decision-making process, alongside inflation. A softening labor market suggests that the Fed‚Äôs aggressive interest rate hikes over the past year and a half are indeed having their intended effect of cooling the economy. This data provides the central bank with more flexibility to consider adjusting its interest rate policy . Here‚Äôs why the latest payrolls report is so impactful: Inflationary Pressures: A strong labor market, characterized by high demand for workers and rising wages, can fuel inflation. Conversely, a weaker job market helps alleviate these pressures, making it easier for the Fed to achieve its 2% inflation target. Economic Activity: Employment is a proxy for overall economic health. Fewer jobs mean less consumer spending power, which can lead to a broader economic slowdown. Policy Implications: Historically, a significant slowdown in job creation has often preceded a shift in monetary policy, typically towards more accommodative stances. The market‚Äôs immediate reaction to this data was to increase the probability of a near-term Fed rate cut , pushing bond yields lower and the dollar down. Is a Fed Rate Cut Imminent? Analyzing the Signals The question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: will a Fed rate cut truly materialize next month, or soon after? The recent payroll data has certainly amplified these expectations. Before this report, the narrative of ‚Äòhigher for longer‚Äô interest rates was dominant, with many analysts believing the Fed would maintain its restrictive stance for an extended period to ensure inflation was fully tamed. However, the shift in labor market dynamics provides a compelling argument for a pivot. The Federal Reserve operates under a dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and stable prices (low inflation). If the employment side of the mandate begins to falter significantly, the Fed might prioritize supporting the labor market, even if inflation hasn‚Äôt perfectly hit its target. Consider these points regarding a potential rate cut: Market Pricing: Futures markets, particularly the CME FedWatch Tool, now show a significantly higher probability of a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Fed Commentary: While Fed officials have maintained a data-dependent stance, weaker economic indicators provide them with the necessary evidence to consider easing monetary policy. Global Context: Other major central banks are also grappling with slowing growth, and a Fed cut could influence global monetary policy trends. While a definitive answer remains elusive until the Fed‚Äôs actual announcement, the signals from recent data strongly point towards a shift in the central bank‚Äôs stance. What Does This Mean for the Broader Economic Outlook ? The potential for a Fed rate cut , driven by the latest weak payrolls data, has significant implications for the broader economic outlook . A reduction in interest rates typically makes borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, which can stimulate economic activity. This could lead to increased investment, higher consumer spending, and potentially a rebound in sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as housing. However, there are also challenges and nuances: Soft Landing vs. Recession: A rate cut might be seen as an attempt by the Fed to engineer a ‚Äòsoft landing‚Äô ‚Äì bringing inflation down without triggering a severe recession. The risk, however, is that the economy might already be slowing more rapidly than anticipated, pushing it towards a deeper downturn. Corporate Earnings: Lower borrowing costs can improve corporate profitability, especially for highly leveraged companies, potentially boosting equity markets. Consumer Behavior: Cheaper loans for mortgages, auto financing, and credit cards could encourage spending, providing a tailwind for the economy. Global Impact: A weaker US Dollar can make American exports more competitive and reduce the debt burden for countries with dollar-denominated loans, influencing global trade and financial stability. The interplay of these factors will shape the trajectory of the economy in the coming quarters. Navigating the Future of Interest Rate Policy The path forward for interest rate policy is fraught with challenges for the Federal Reserve. They must carefully balance the risks of persistent inflation against the threat of an economic downturn. The recent weak payrolls data complicates this balancing act, pushing them towards a more dovish stance. Here are some actionable insights for investors and market watchers: Monitor Inflation Data: While employment data is crucial, inflation reports (CPI, PCE) will continue to be key determinants of the Fed‚Äôs actions. Any resurgence in inflation could delay or reverse rate cut plans. Watch Fed Communications: Pay close attention to speeches and press conferences from Fed officials. Their forward guidance will offer critical clues about future policy moves. Diversify Portfolios: In times of economic uncertainty and shifting monetary policy, diversification across different asset classes (equities, bonds, commodities, cryptocurrencies) can help mitigate risk. Consider Dollar Hedging: For international investors or those with significant dollar exposure, exploring hedging strategies might be prudent if the US Dollar continues its decline. The Fed‚Äôs decisions will not only influence the value of the US Dollar but also impact global liquidity, capital flows, and the overall attractiveness of various asset classes, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Global Markets The recent dip in the US Dollar , spurred by surprisingly weak payrolls data, marks a pivotal moment for global financial markets. The heightened anticipation of a Fed rate cut signals a potential shift in the central bank‚Äôs aggressive tightening cycle, moving towards a more accommodative interest rate policy . This change could redefine the economic outlook , influencing everything from bond yields and equity performance to commodity prices and, crucially, the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. As the Federal Reserve navigates this complex landscape, market participants must remain agile, adapting their strategies to the evolving macro environment. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this signals a temporary blip or the beginning of a sustained easing cycle.

2025-08-04 09:14:20,49524784,1754298860,France‚Äôs National Rally Proposes Bitcoin Mining at Nuclear Facilities,"France‚Äôs National Rally (RN) party is drafting a new bill to launch Bitcoin mining operations at state-run nuclear facilities. The proposal , spearheaded by MP Aur√©lien Lopez‚ÄëLiguori, aims to repurpose surplus nuclear energy during periods of low demand.The pilot program, set to run for five years, would deploy high-powered computers at EDF's nuclear plants for blockchain operations. √âlectricit√© de France (EDF) is the state-owned utility that manages most of France's nuclear energy infrastructure. These machines would perform complex blockchain calculations in exchange for newly minted Bitcoin.Economic Rationale Behind the Mining PlanFor context, French nuclear plants often generate more electricity than needed during off-peak times. Currently, this surplus energy is either wasted or sold at a loss. The RN‚Äôs plan seeks to capture that wasted energy and convert it into digital assets, essentially, transforming lost potential into state revenue.Industry projections suggest even one gigawatt of unused nuclear power could yield $100‚Äì150 million in annual Bitcoin rewards. France lost roughly ‚Ç¨80‚ÄØmillion in 2024 due to surplus energy being sold at a loss or wasted¬†From Crypto Critic to Blockchain AdvocateThis plan marks a dramatic policy shift for RN leader Marine Le Pen. In 2016, she strongly opposed cryptocurrencies, branding them as tools of financial elites. Her stance began to soften in 2022 with a call for regulation. Now in 2025, she‚Äôs advocating direct state participation in crypto mining, a significant ideological reversal.Opportunities and ObjectionsMeanwhile, proponents argue the plan could enhance grid flexibility. Bitcoin farms can rapidly adjust power usage, helping stabilize supply and demand. There‚Äôs also potential to repurpose mining heat to warm homes, greenhouses, or public spaces, a method already practiced in parts of Northern Europe.Despite its economic promise, the plan has drawn sharp criticism. Environmental advocates argue that crypto mining, regardless of its power source, remains energy-intensive and sends the wrong message on climate responsibility.¬†Politically, the proposal may also face a rocky path. A similar initiative failed to pass in June, highlighting the challenges of gaining broad parliamentary support. To move forward, RN must rally enough allies to overcome legislative resistance.Should the bill pass, France could become the first European country to integrate nuclear power into Bitcoin mining. This step would not only expand France‚Äôs digital asset reserves but also serve as a model for other nations looking to monetize excess renewable or nuclear energy.For many in the crypto space, this shift reflects how far Bitcoin has advanced, from a volatile niche asset to a tool considered for national strategy.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,1,france national rally rn party drafting new bill launch bitcoin mining operation nuclear facility proposal spearheaded mp aur√©lien aim repurpose surplus nuclear energy period low pilot program set run five year would deploy computer edf nuclear plant blockchain operation √©lectricit√© de france edf utility manages france nuclear energy infrastructure machine would perform complex blockchain calculation exchange newly minted rationale behind mining planfor context french nuclear plant often generate electricity needed time currently surplus energy either wasted sold loss rn plan seek capture wasted energy convert digital asset essentially transforming lost potential state projection suggest even one gigawatt unused nuclear power could yield million annual bitcoin reward france lost roughly million due surplus energy sold loss wasted crypto critic blockchain advocatethis plan mark dramatic policy shift rn leader marine le pen strongly opposed cryptocurrencies branding tool financial elite stance began soften call regulation advocating direct state participation crypto mining significant ideological objectionsmeanwhile proponent argue plan could enhance grid flexibility bitcoin farm rapidly adjust power usage helping stabilize supply demand also potential repurpose mining heat warm home greenhouse public space method already practiced part northern economic promise plan drawn sharp criticism environmental advocate argue crypto mining regardless power source remains sends wrong message climate responsibility politically proposal may also face rocky path similar initiative failed pas june highlighting challenge gaining broad parliamentary support move forward rn must rally enough ally overcome legislative bill pas france could become first european country integrate nuclear power bitcoin mining step would expand france digital asset reserve also serve model nation looking monetize excess renewable nuclear many crypto space shift reflects far bitcoin advanced volatile niche asset tool considered national strategy,0.117,0.716,0.167,0.9081,1
2025-08-04 09:14:10,49514854,1754298850,"Satoshi Nakamoto Statue Stolen in Switzerland, 0.1 BTC Reward Offered for Recovery","A Satoshi Nakamoto statue was stolen from Parco Ciani in Lugano, Switzerland, with vandals forcibly removing the bronze sculpture from its welded base and dumping it into nearby Lake Lugano. Satoshigallery, the art collective behind the installation, offered a 0.1 Bitcoin reward worth approximately $12,000 for information leading to the statue‚Äôs recovery. The theft occurred following Swiss National Day celebrations on August 1, with witnesses reporting the statue was still in place that evening. Source: Satoshigallery on X Vandals Use Industrial Tools to Remove Monument from Lake Park Local investigators suspect intoxicated revelers from nearby outdoor cafes vandalized the monument before discarding it in the lake rather than attempting profitable theft. Evidence at the scene included cutting marks on the plinth suggesting tungsten carbide cutting disks and petrol-powered angle grinders were used to sever the statue‚Äôs welded connections. Source: Gritto on X Only the feet remained attached to the mounting points, while the rest of the ‚ÄúDisappearing Satoshi‚Äù sculpture vanished. The Lugano statue was part of Satoshigallery‚Äôs global campaign to install 21 Satoshi Nakamoto monuments worldwide, representing Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million coin supply cap. Other installations include statues in Budapest, Hungary (2021), Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, and Tokyo, Japan, with plans for additional locations in development. Satoshigallery condemned the vandalism while vowing to continue their mission, stating, ‚ÄúYou can steal our symbol but you will never be able to steal our souls.‚Äù The collective remains committed to replacing damaged monuments and expanding its global network of Bitcoin tributes. Global Monument Campaign Honors Bitcoin‚Äôs Anonymous Creator The Satoshi statue movement began in Budapest on September 16, 2021 , when Hungarian crypto journalist Andr√°s Gy√∂rfi unveiled the world‚Äôs first Nakamoto monument in Graphisoft Park. The bronze bust was created by sculptors Tam√°s Gilly and Reka Gergely, and features a faceless, hooded figure with a mirrored surface allowing viewers to see themselves. The Budapest design established the ‚Äúwe are all Satoshi‚Äù symbolism that became central to subsequent installations. The reflective face represents Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature and Nakamoto‚Äôs anonymity, while the hoodie became an iconic element replicated across multiple monuments. Satoshigallery expanded the concept globally with their ‚ÄúDisappearing Satoshi‚Äù design unveiled in Lugano on October 25, 2024, during the city‚Äôs Plan ‚Çø Forum. Artist Valentina Picozzi created the stainless steel and corten block sculpture depicting a seated figure at a laptop that appears to vanish when viewed from different angles. The Tokyo installation followed in April 2025, continuing the campaign‚Äôs mission to spread Bitcoin culture through public art. Each statue incorporates unique design elements while maintaining core themes of anonymity, decentralization, and community ownership of Bitcoin‚Äôs legacy. The Lugano theft marks the first major vandalism incident affecting official Satoshi monuments, despite previous installations remaining untouched for years. Municipal authorities are investigating the incident while crypto communities worldwide have rallied support for replacement efforts. Nakamoto‚Äôs Digital Fortune Reaches Historic Heights Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs estimated 1.096 million Bitcoin holdings reached a theoretical value of $132.8 billion as Bitcoin surged past $120,000 in July 2025 . Blockchain analytics firm Arkham estimates the fortune places Nakamoto 11th on global wealth rankings, surpassing tech magnate Michael Dell‚Äôs $125.1 billion net worth. The dormant wallets have remained untouched since Nakamoto‚Äôs 2011 disappearance, with any movement potentially triggering massive market volatility. Despite the enormous wealth, unknown parties continue sending tribute donations to Nakamoto‚Äôs Genesis Block address, including a recent $20,000 transfer in June . Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted Nakamoto could reach second place on billionaire rankings by 2026 if Bitcoin maintains typical 50% annual growth rates. If bitcoin does its normal 50%/ann then Satoshi will pass Buffett this year and Zuck sometime next year-ish to be #2 richest in world (Elon has huge lead). It's fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in. It echoes Jack Bogle in that regard https://t.co/tu9MRzUD5h ‚Äî Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 2, 2025 The fortune would need Bitcoin prices around $370,000 to surpass current wealth leaders like Elon Musk‚Äôs $404 billion net worth. Identity speculation intensified in 2025 with researchers pointing to various candidates, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey . Legal battles concluded with Craig Wright‚Äôs conviction for fraudulent claims to be Bitcoin‚Äôs creator , while HBO documentary filmmaker Cullen Hoback named Canadian developer Peter Todd as a potential candidate . The statue vandalism coincides with renewed interest in Nakamoto‚Äôs identity and growing institutional Bitcoin adoption worldwide.

Many altcoins have posted even more impressive gains, such as HASH, ENA, and XLM ‚Äì all of which are up by double digits. BTC Aims at $115K Bitcoin began the previous business week inside a familiar trading range between $117,000 and $119,000. It went through some volatility on Wednesday evening after the US Federal Reserve concluded its latest FOMC meeting for the year and said it won‚Äôt change the key interest rates. The actual fluctuations, though, transpired in the following days. BTC had rebounded to $119,000 on Thursday morning, but propelled by Trump‚Äôs latest tariffs and subsequent nuclear submarine movement in response to Russian actions, the asset started to nosedive. The culmination arrived on Saturday evening when bitcoin slumped to just under $112,000 for the first time in just over two weeks. The bulls finally reemerged at this point and didn‚Äôt allow another breakdown to take place. Instead, BTC started to recover some ground gradually and jumped to $115,000 earlier today, where it faced some resistance and is now just inches below that level. Its market cap has climbed to $2.280 trillion on CG, while its dominance has settled at 60%. Nevertheless, more volatility due to macro reasons is expected later this week. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts on the Rebound Most altcoins took the recent correction worse than BTC, which is to be expected. Ethereum, for instance, went from roughly $3,900 to around $3,400. Now, though, it trades above $3,550 after a 3% daily jump. XRP dumped below the crucial support at $3 to a multi-week low of $2.72. However, it has recovered a lot of ground and is now retesting $3. BNB, SOL, TRX, DOGE, ADA, SUI, and LINK are also in the green from the larger-cap alts. XLM has stolen the show from this cohort of alts, with a massive 9.5% surge to over $0.41. ENA and HASH have rocketed by similar percentages. The total crypto market cap has added $60 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.8 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-08-04 09:10:11,49514688,1754298611,"Bitcoin Transfer: Unveiling the Crucial 2,033 BTC Shift to Binance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfer: Unveiling the Crucial 2,033 BTC Shift to Binance In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, every significant movement of digital assets captures attention. A recent event that has sparked considerable discussion is the substantial Bitcoin transfer of 2,033 BTC from Ceffu to Binance. This transaction, valued at approximately $233 million at the time of reporting, was flagged by Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service. Such a large Bitcoin transfer is not just a mere transaction; it often carries broader implications for market sentiment, liquidity, and the overall crypto ecosystem. Understanding the nuances behind these movements is crucial for anyone keen on the dynamics of the digital asset space. What Does This Bitcoin Transfer Signify? When a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, moves between wallets or exchanges, it can be interpreted in various ways. This specific Bitcoin transfer of 2,033 BTC from Ceffu to Binance immediately raises questions about the intent behind such a large-scale movement. Is it a strategic move by a large investor, an institutional rebalancing, or something else entirely? Here are some immediate considerations: Market Sentiment: Large transfers to exchanges can sometimes signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, large withdrawals from exchanges might suggest long-term holding intentions, indicating a bullish outlook. This particular Bitcoin transfer to Binance could imply preparation for trading activity. Liquidity Management: Exchanges need sufficient liquidity to facilitate trades, especially for large orders. This influx of BTC could be part of Binance‚Äôs liquidity management strategy, ensuring smooth operations for its vast user base. Institutional Activity: Ceffu is known as an institutional-grade custody solution. A transfer from Ceffu to Binance suggests institutional involvement, perhaps related to over-the-counter (OTC) deals, large block trades, or other institutional financial operations that require significant capital on an exchange. Understanding these potential reasons helps in deciphering the broader impact of such a significant Bitcoin transfer . Who is Ceffu and Why the Transfer to Binance? To fully grasp the context of this Bitcoin transfer , it is important to understand the entities involved. Ceffu, formerly known as Binance Custody, is an institutional-grade digital asset custody provider. It offers secure storage solutions for large institutions and high-net-worth individuals, often acting as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Binance, on the other hand, is one of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its extensive trading pairs, liquidity, and diverse services. The movement of 2,033 BTC from a secure custody provider like Ceffu to a major exchange like Binance can occur for several reasons: OTC Desk Operations: Large institutions or whales often utilize OTC desks for significant trades to avoid impacting market prices on open exchanges. Funds might be moved from custody to an exchange‚Äôs OTC desk to facilitate such transactions. Rebalancing Portfolios: Institutions regularly rebalance their crypto portfolios based on market conditions, investment strategies, or regulatory requirements. This could involve moving assets to an exchange for conversion or deployment. Preparation for Market Events: Anticipation of significant market events, such as major news, upgrades, or price movements, might prompt large holders to position their assets on an exchange for quicker execution of trades. Operational Needs: Binance itself might be moving funds from its custody partner (Ceffu) to its hot wallets or operational reserves to manage its liquidity more effectively for day-to-day trading and withdrawal demands. This particular Bitcoin transfer highlights the intricate relationship between institutional custody solutions and major trading platforms, showcasing the growing maturity of the crypto financial landscape. How Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Impact Market Dynamics? The sheer size of a 2,033 BTC transfer is enough to ripple through the market. While not always directly leading to immediate price action, such large movements are closely watched by traders and analysts. Here‚Äôs a look at their potential impact: Impact Category Potential Effect of Large Bitcoin Transfer Liquidity Increases available supply on exchanges, potentially easing large buy/sell orders. Volatility Can trigger short-term price swings as market participants react to perceived intent. Market Sentiment Often interpreted as bullish (if withdrawal) or bearish (if deposit), influencing trader psychology. Whale Behavior Tracking Provides insights into the strategies of major holders, offering clues for smaller investors. It is important to note that a single Bitcoin transfer , even a large one, is rarely the sole determinant of market direction. It is one data point among many that analysts consider when assessing the overall health and direction of the crypto market. Are There Challenges or Opportunities Associated with This Bitcoin Transfer? Every significant event in the crypto market presents both challenges and opportunities. This 2,033 BTC Bitcoin transfer is no exception. Challenges: Misinterpretation Risk: Without clear communication from the entities involved, such transfers can be misinterpreted, leading to speculative trading and unnecessary market panic or euphoria. Security Concerns: While Ceffu and Binance are highly secure, any large transfer carries inherent, albeit minimal, transactional risks. The secure nature of blockchain technology mitigates most of these. Market Impact Uncertainty: The true impact on price can be unpredictable, as it depends on subsequent actions (e.g., whether the BTC is actually sold, or just moved for internal reasons). Opportunities: Transparency for On-Chain Analysts: Blockchain explorers and services like Whale Alert provide unparalleled transparency. This allows analysts to track large movements and gain insights into potential market shifts, which is a unique advantage of decentralized ledgers. Informed Decision-Making: For savvy investors, monitoring significant Bitcoin transfer events can offer valuable data points to inform their own trading or investment strategies, helping them anticipate potential market trends. Market Efficiency: The ability for large amounts of capital to move efficiently between custody solutions and exchanges contributes to the overall efficiency and maturity of the crypto market. This dual nature means that while there are points of caution, the transparency of blockchain offers significant advantages for those willing to dive into the data. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts from a Bitcoin Transfer For individuals interested in navigating the crypto market, observing a large Bitcoin transfer like this offers several actionable insights: Stay Informed, Not Reactive: While it is good to be aware of large movements, avoid making impulsive trading decisions based on a single transaction. Look for corroborating evidence and broader market trends. Utilize On-Chain Analytics: Tools that track whale movements and exchange flows can provide valuable context. Learning to interpret this data can enhance your understanding of market dynamics. Consider the Source and Destination: Understanding whether a transfer is from a mining pool, a cold wallet, an exchange, or a custody provider helps in assessing its potential impact. The Ceffu-to-Binance transfer, for example, points towards institutional or strategic activity. Long-Term Perspective: For most long-term investors, short-term whale movements have minimal impact on their overall strategy. Focus on Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamental value proposition and broader adoption trends. By adopting a measured and analytical approach, crypto enthusiasts can leverage information from a significant Bitcoin transfer to their advantage. Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of Large Bitcoin Transfers The recent Bitcoin transfer of 2,033 BTC from Ceffu to Binance serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and transparent nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate implications of such movements are often debated, they undeniably offer valuable insights into the activities of major players and the underlying health of the market. Whether signaling potential market shifts, reflecting institutional strategy, or simply facilitating operational needs, large Bitcoin transfers remain a crucial data point for anyone tracking the pulse of the digital economy. As the crypto space continues to evolve, the ability to interpret these on-chain signals will only grow in importance, offering a unique window into the future of finance.

2025-08-04 09:09:17,49515864,1754298557,"BTC rebounds to $114k, could reclaim $118k soon: check forecast","The cryptocurrency market was bearish over the weekend, with Bitcoin dropping to the $112k mark on Saturday. Altcoins recorded bigger losses, with most of them losing over 5% of their value during that period. However, the market is currently undergoing a small rebound, with Bitcoin reclaiming the $115k level earlier. The rebound could see BTC reclaim the $118k resistance level in the coming hours. Metaplanet buys more bitcoins as BTC rebounds Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is up by less than 1% in the last 24 hours and now trades around $114,600. The positive performance comes after BTC lost 4% of its value over the weekend and dropped to the $112k level. However, the market is currently undergoing a rebound thanks to positive macroeconomic factors. Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet announced on Monday that it had purchased 463 BTC for $53.7 million. The latest bitcoin acquisition brought the company‚Äôs total holdings to 17,595 BTC, acquired for $1.78 billion. The primary catalyst behind BTC‚Äôs poor performance over the weekend was the fresh concerns over tariffs by President Trump. The concerns resulted in a net outflow of nearly $1 billion from Bitcoin ETFs on Thursday and Friday. The outflow suggested that institutional investors were reducing their exposure to Bitcoin amid uncertainty in global trade. Despite that, analysts remain confident that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high of $140k soon. John Glover, chief investment officer at crypto financial services company Ledn, disclosed that the sell-off is a typical retracement wave, representing a temporary breather from the preceding bullish impulse wave. The analyst added that the sell-off could serve as the catalyst to push BTC to $140,000 by year-end. ‚ÄúFirmly caught in the summer doldrums, the BTC price continues to follow the expected trajectory and will soon complete the 5-wave move depicted by the blue line [in the chart] below, which will finish wave iii (yellow line) of Wave 5 (orange line). All to say, we‚Äôre still on target to hit $135,000 ‚Äì $140,000 by the end of 2025,‚Äù Glover added. BTC eyes $118k as weekly candle opens bullish The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bearish following Bitcoin‚Äôs poor performance last week. However, the weekly candle opens bullish, suggesting a switch in momentum. The technical indicators are also improving, signalling a temporary bullish bias. Bitcoin‚Äôs 50-day EMA roughly coincides with the previous all-time high of $111,980, making it a key support zone. If the support zone holds, BTC could extend its recovery past the TLQ at $116k and rally towards the previous support level of $118k. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart reads 46 and points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bullish momentum. The MACD lines are also set to cross over into the bullish zone soon. However, if Bitcoin faces a downward correction, it could extend the decline toward its key support level at $112,975.

2025-08-04 09:05:10,49514445,1754298310,Swiss Franc‚Äôs Shocking Decline: US Tariffs Threaten Global Trade Stability,"BitcoinWorld Swiss Franc‚Äôs Shocking Decline: US Tariffs Threaten Global Trade Stability In the unpredictable world of finance, where every ripple in the global economy can send waves through various markets, understanding macro-economic shifts is crucial, even for those deeply entrenched in the fast-paced cryptocurrency space. While crypto markets often operate on their own unique dynamics, they are not entirely immune to broader economic forces. The recent unexpected depreciation of the Swiss franc , a currency traditionally revered as a safe haven, despite an uptick in domestic inflation, serves as a potent reminder of how complex interconnected global factors can be. This surprising development is largely attributed to escalating concerns over new US tariffs , creating a challenging environment for investors and policymakers alike. Why is the Swiss Franc Losing its Safe-Haven Appeal? For decades, the Swiss franc (CHF) has been a beacon of stability in times of global economic uncertainty. Its reputation as a safe-haven currency stems from Switzerland‚Äôs robust economy, political neutrality, and strong financial institutions. Investors typically flock to the CHF during periods of market turmoil, expecting it to retain or even appreciate in value. However, recent movements suggest a deviation from this historical pattern. Despite an uptick in inflation, which would typically prompt a central bank to consider tightening monetary policy, thereby strengthening the currency, the CHF has seen a noticeable fall. This paradoxical behavior indicates that other, more powerful forces are at play. The traditional appeal of the CHF is being challenged by a confluence of factors, including shifting investor sentiment and the overshadowing impact of geopolitical tensions. While Switzerland‚Äôs economy remains sound, external pressures are proving significant. The market‚Äôs perception of safe havens is evolving, and the dollar, for instance, often reaps the benefits of global uncertainty due to its unparalleled liquidity and the size of the US economy. The Pervasive Impact of US Tariffs on Currency Markets The specter of new US tariffs looms large over the global economic landscape, directly influencing currency valuations. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, designed to protect domestic industries but often leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries. Such trade disputes create immense uncertainty, disrupting supply chains, increasing costs for businesses, and dampening global economic growth prospects. When the United States, the world‚Äôs largest economy, implements or threatens new tariffs, the ripple effect is immediate and widespread. Here‚Äôs how US tariffs typically impact currencies: Increased Uncertainty: Businesses become hesitant to invest, and consumers may curb spending, leading to slower economic activity globally. This general risk aversion often pushes investors towards the perceived safety of the US dollar, even if the tariffs originate from the US itself. Disrupted Trade Flows: Tariffs alter the competitiveness of goods, shifting demand and supply patterns. Countries facing tariffs may see their exports decline, weakening their currencies. Retaliation: Other countries often respond with their own tariffs, escalating the trade war. This creates a vicious cycle that further damages global trade and investor confidence, causing broader currency volatility. For the Swiss franc, the concern is that broader trade wars could undermine the stability of export-oriented economies, even those not directly targeted, leading to a flight of capital towards more liquid and dominant safe havens like the USD. Navigating the Shifting Tides of Global Trade The current environment of escalating trade tensions highlights the fragility of global trade relationships. For decades, the world benefited from a relatively open and integrated trading system, fostering economic growth and specialization. However, the rise of protectionist policies, particularly from major economic powers, is reshaping this landscape. The impact on currencies is multifaceted: Reduced Export Competitiveness: Countries heavily reliant on exports, like Switzerland, can see their trade surpluses diminish if global trade volumes shrink or if their goods become less competitive due to tariffs elsewhere. A decline in exports can weaken the domestic currency. Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies struggle to plan and operate efficiently when tariffs unpredictably change the cost of inputs or the market for their products. This uncertainty can lead to reduced investment and economic output. Investor Sentiment: A deteriorating global trade outlook often leads investors to de-risk, pulling funds from more vulnerable economies and currencies and moving them into perceived safer assets, which in this context, surprisingly, has not been the CHF. The broader implications of disrupted global trade extend beyond just tariffs. They include a potential re-evaluation of international supply chains, a shift towards regional trade blocs, and an overall slowdown in global economic expansion, all of which weigh heavily on currency valuations. The Paradox: Why Isn‚Äôt Inflation Impact Boosting the CHF? Typically, an uptick in inflation within an economy would be seen as a positive sign for its currency. Higher inflation often signals a robust economy, and central banks usually respond by raising interest rates to curb price increases. Higher interest rates make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns, thus increasing demand and strengthening the currency. However, in the case of the Swiss franc, this expected inflation impact is not playing out as anticipated. Several factors contribute to this paradox: Economic Factor Recent Trend Expected CHF Impact Actual CHF Impact Inflation (CPI) Uptick (modest) Strengthen (potential rate hikes) Weakened (other factors dominate) Interest Rates (SNB) Steady/Potential Cuts Weakened Weakened Global Trade Tensions Increasing (US Tariffs) Uncertainty/Flight to USD Weakened Safe-Haven Demand Decreasing/Shifting Strengthen Weakened Modest Inflation: While there‚Äôs an uptick, Swiss inflation might still be considered moderate by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), not strong enough to warrant aggressive rate hikes that would significantly boost the franc. SNB‚Äôs Stance: The SNB has historically been cautious about excessive CHF strength, often intervening to prevent it from becoming too strong, which could harm Switzerland‚Äôs export sector. They might prioritize maintaining export competitiveness over strengthening the currency based on a minor inflation uptick. Dominance of External Factors: The sheer weight of global trade concerns and the potential for a global economic slowdown, largely driven by US tariffs, are overshadowing the domestic inflation signal. Investors are more concerned about systemic risks than the nuances of Swiss monetary policy. Relative Rate Differentials: If other major central banks are maintaining higher rates or are expected to hike more aggressively, the CHF‚Äôs relatively lower yield still makes it less attractive for carry trades, despite its own inflation. This highlights that in an interconnected world, domestic economic indicators do not always dictate currency performance in isolation; external pressures can easily override them. Understanding Current Currency Market Dynamics The recent fall of the Swiss franc, despite an inflation uptick, is a prime example of complex currency market dynamics at play. It underscores that currency valuations are not merely a function of interest rate differentials or domestic economic health, but also heavily influenced by geopolitical events, trade policies, and shifting investor perceptions of risk. Key dynamics currently influencing the CHF and other major currencies include: Risk-Off vs. Risk-On: While the CHF traditionally benefits from risk-off sentiment, the current scenario sees the USD often preferred during broad uncertainty due to its liquidity and the sheer size of the US bond market. Geopolitical Premium/Discount: Currencies can carry a premium or discount based on their nation‚Äôs involvement in or exposure to global conflicts and trade wars. Central Bank Divergence: Different central banks pursuing divergent monetary policies (e.g., one hiking rates while another signals cuts) create significant currency movements. The SNB‚Äôs stance, even with inflation, plays a crucial role. Flows and Liquidity: Large institutional capital flows can rapidly move currencies. If major funds are de-risking from European assets due to trade concerns, the CHF might suffer even if Switzerland is not directly targeted. Relative Economic Strength: While Switzerland‚Äôs economy is strong, the perceived future growth trajectory relative to other major economies, especially under the cloud of global trade wars, can impact currency appeal. Investors must look beyond single indicators and adopt a holistic view, considering the interplay of trade, inflation, monetary policy, and geopolitical stability to accurately forecast currency movements. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors The current situation presents both challenges and potential opportunities for investors. The primary challenge is the heightened uncertainty. Predicting the trajectory of US tariffs and their ripple effects on global trade is difficult, making currency forecasting more complex than usual. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Sudden shifts in trade rhetoric or policy can lead to sharp, unpredictable currency movements. Erosion of Traditional Safe Havens: The CHF‚Äôs recent performance suggests that traditional safe-haven roles can be challenged by new geopolitical realities. Divergent Signals: Domestic economic strength (inflation uptick) can be overshadowed by external weaknesses (trade wars), creating confusing signals. Actionable Insights: Diversification: Do not rely solely on one safe-haven asset. Consider a diversified portfolio that includes various assets, potentially even a small allocation to robust cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which some view as a hedge against traditional financial system instability. Stay Informed on Trade Policy: Closely monitor developments regarding US tariffs and retaliatory measures from other nations. These announcements will likely be key drivers of currency market sentiment. Evaluate Relative Strength: Instead of absolute economic indicators, assess the relative economic strength and policy stances of major economies against each other. Consider Hedging Strategies: For businesses or investors with significant exposure to the CHF or other currencies affected by trade tensions, consider hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk. Conclusion: Navigating a New Era of Currency Volatility The unexpected decline of the Swiss franc amidst rising inflation, largely driven by concerns over new US tariffs , serves as a powerful testament to the intricate and often counter-intuitive nature of currency market dynamics in the current global economic climate. It underscores that even the most reliable safe-haven currencies are not immune to the far-reaching consequences of protectionist trade policies and their profound impact on global trade . The traditional signals of inflation impact are being overridden by broader geopolitical and economic anxieties, forcing investors to re-evaluate their strategies and risk assessments. As the world grapples with ongoing trade tensions, understanding these complex interdependencies becomes paramount. For investors, this means moving beyond conventional analyses and adopting a more holistic view that incorporates geopolitical risks, central bank intentions, and the ever-evolving landscape of international commerce. The resilience of currencies will increasingly depend not just on domestic fundamentals, but on their nation‚Äôs ability to navigate the choppy waters of global economic fragmentation. This era demands vigilance, adaptability, and a comprehensive understanding of the forces shaping our financial future.

2025-08-04 09:02:32,49515863,1754298152,"From $0.035 to $5, how this DeFi token could outpace Cardano‚Äôs 2021 run","Unlike ADA, which took years to build and integrate utility features, MUTM is preparing to launch with its complete DeFi ecosystem already in motion, offering lending, staking, stablecoin mechanisms, and smart contract-based yield systems right from the beginning. And this time, investors aren‚Äôt just betting on hype‚Äîthey‚Äôre getting access to a protocol designed with real-time financial infrastructure. At just $0.035 in Phase 6, the opportunity to get in early on what many analysts believe could be the next $5 token is still wide open. A full DeFi ecosystem on launch ‚Äî not just promises What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its layered, utility-focused approach. The ecosystem is built on yield-generating smart contracts powered by mtTokens‚Äîthese represent users‚Äô deposited assets and accrue interest over time. Users of mtTokens will be able to stake them in designated smart contracts and earn MUTM rewards, which are bought back from the open market using revenue generated by the protocol. This creates a sustainable rewards loop that increases token demand while rewarding users. The launch of a decentralized stablecoin is also planned, pegged algorithmically at $1 through a controlled issuance system governed by borrowing rates. This stablecoin is expected to act as a backbone of the protocol, ensuring borrowing confidence, reducing volatility, and creating additional lending demand. On top of that, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is integrating Layer-2 scalability to cut gas fees significantly, enabling smoother, low-cost interactions for users across all features. With mtTokens being tested in controlled environments, all of this functionality is expected to be fully activated during the platform‚Äôs beta launch at listing, instantly unlocking real use cases that most DeFi projects only promise down the line. In contrast to ADA‚Äôs slow rollout of smart contract features, MUTM‚Äôs infrastructure is built to operate from day one, allowing the token to reflect real protocol value, not speculative delays. Security has also been baked into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs development cycle, giving it an edge in institutional appeal. The platform received a CertiK Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 78.00, confirming rigorous reviews including static code analysis and manual auditing. Presale accelerates as listings approach Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. More than 10% of the 170 million Phase 6 tokens have already been acquired, with over 14,800 investors participating and a total of $13.9 million raised. The next pricing jump to $0.040 represents a 15% increase, and it‚Äôs quickly approaching, amplifying urgency among those looking to get in before the price shift. Looking ahead, large-scale centralized exchange listings‚Äîincluding potential appearances on Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase‚Äîare expected to amplify global visibility and user onboarding. This exposure could rapidly increase liquidity and drive the token into a parabolic trajectory. Once the full protocol is accessible post-listing, comparisons between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and major DeFi platforms like Aave or Compound will likely begin in earnest, especially since MUTM introduces novel revenue-sharing dynamics through mtToken staking and protocol-funded token buybacks. Unlike Cardano (ADA)‚Äôs long road to real-world integration, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to enter the market with a complete DeFi toolkit, empowering users to lend, borrow, earn, and stake‚Äîall within a fully non-custodial, secure environment. Investors who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 have already secured 250% gains. If the projected listing price of $0.06 is only the beginning, and analysts are right about the $5 target, even Phase 6 buyers could see a 140x return. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn‚Äôt trying to follow the footsteps of older layer-1s.

The initiative is part of its ongoing Bitcoin Treasury Operations to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027. The firm has 17,595 BTC in its holdings worth approximately 261.28 billion yen ($1.78 billion). The acquisition follows the company‚Äôs plan to hold 30,000 BTC by year-end, 100,000 BTC by 2026. Metaplanet plans to boost its BTC acquisition strategy *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 463 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 17,595 BTC* pic.twitter.com/BVVt8DYAV0 ‚Äî Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) August 4, 2025 Metaplanet has achieved a BTC Yield of 24.6% from July 1 to August 4, 2025. Its total year-to-date BTC yield is 170%. The Japanese company said it uses the metric to track the performance of its BTC acquisition strategy. The Tokyo-listed firm also uses other metrics such as BTC Gain and BTC Yen Gain to increase shareholders‚Äô gains in Bitcoin and yen terms, respectively. ‚ÄúOur goal is to have multiple tools to raise capital for buying Bitcoin. On a Bitcoin standard, the mission is to continuously grow Bitcoin per share. Issuing perpetual preferreds is a highly accretive tool designed to maximize long-term shareholder value.‚Äù ‚Äì Simon Gerovich , President of Metaplanet. The Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm revealed on Friday plans to issue roughly 555 billion yen ($3.7 billion) worth of shares to boost its BTC acquisition strategy. Metaplanet seeks to issue the shares in portions across a period of two years, from August 9, 2025, to August 8, 2027. The company added that plans for the issuance of the Preferred Shares were still in progress, despite uncertainty about whether they would go through. Metaplanet will vote on the proposals at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on September 1. The Tokyo-listed firm said the initiative is part of its initial proposal to increase its authorized shares from $1.16 billion to $2.723 billion. The company said the proposal aims to give it the flexibility in how it raises capital for future Bitcoin acquisitions. The proposal is part of the company‚Äôs plan to establish provisions for two new classes of perpetual preferred shares, Class A and Class B. The initiative would split the value of the shares at 277.5 billion yen each and prioritize payouts up to 6% over common shareholders. Metaplanet also reported strong second-quarter earnings this year, generating nearly 1.1 billion yen ($7.6 million). At the time of publication, Metaplanet‚Äôs stock price is exchanging hands at 982 yen, a 7.62% drop in the last 24 hours. The firm‚Äôs Bitcoin-focused business still saw a 174.7% surge in its share price YTD, despite having a 36.14% drop in the past month. Metaplanet seeks other investment options beyond BTC accumulation Gerovich also recently told the Financial Times that Metaplanet is looking for other investments beyond its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. According to the report, the firm plans to use its BTC stash as collateral to finance acquisitions. The company‚Äôs CEO said they were in a ‚ÄúBitcoin gold rush‚Äù and want to boost their revenue by using their Bitcoin holdings to purchase real businesses that generate cash. He said the firm wants to reach its BTC accumulation goals of owning 1% of total Bitcoins. Gerovich added that the firm will use the BTC holdings as collateral to raise funds from lenders, such as securities or government bonds. He mentioned that the proceeds from the initiative would be used to acquire profitable cash-generating businesses that align with Metaplanet‚Äôs current strategy, such as financial services or digital banking. Gerovich also revealed that the firm won‚Äôt use convertible debt like Strategy, adding that the company doesn‚Äôt plan to sell its holdings but will continue to buy more.

2025-08-04 09:00:21,49524782,1754298021,Bitcoin Could See a Bullish Breakout or a Downward Pull as It Retests Crucial 8-Year Trendline,"A prominent analyst notes Bitcoin retesting a key long-term trendline, signaling a possible continuation of the uptrend or downward pull to lower levels. In a post on X, crypto analyst Michael noted that Bitcoin is retesting this 8-year trendline after reaching a new all-time high above $123,000. Bitcoin has since declined from this high, currently trading at $114,335, a 0.7% decline in the past day, following a 4.1% drop in the past week.The chart shared by Michael identifies the trendline as a key structure that has historically influenced Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycles. A sustained retest above the line could confirm a bullish move, while failure may lead to a correction.Historical Significance of the Bitcoin TrendlineFor context, the yellow ascending trendline began in late 2017 and cut through several major price moves. It first acted as resistance during the late 2017 bull run, when Bitcoin reached $19,834, before reappearing in later cycles, including 2021 when Bitcoin rose to around $64,000 but was rejected in April. Crypto Michael says Bitcoin is testing bullish zone Crypto Michael says Bitcoin is testing the bullish zone Although BTC later broke above the line, reaching a new all-time high above $69,000, the move faltered by early 2022, coinciding with the end of that cycle‚Äôs rally.The current chart shows a similar structure. Bitcoin broke above the trendline as it surged to a new all-time high above $123,000 but has since pulled back to retest the level. The immediate level to watch is $114,000 to $115,000, where Bitcoin is now trading.If Bitcoin holds this level and closes above the multi-year trendline again, it could trigger more upside. However, a drop below may resemble the failed breakout seen in 2022.¬†Bitcoin to $150-$200k Bearish Moves Next?Similarly, a chart shared by prominent trader Ash Crypto shows Bitcoin replicating its 2017 bull run. In 2017, BTC broke out of a series of descending channels before a vertical surge from $7,900 to its all-time high of $19,841. Ash Crypto sees Bitcoin mirroing 2017 bull run Ash Crypto sees Bitcoin mirroring the 2017 bull run Now, in 2025, the price is trading above a local low of $111,919 and beneath resistance at $116,000, mirroring the same setup seen before the final rally in 2017.¬†Ash Crypto mentions that BTC is now in a parabolic phase and could be on the verge of another massive breakout, potentially targeting $150,000‚Äì$180,000 in the coming weeks.Similarly, a new side-by-side chart shared by Trending Bitcoin also highlights similarities between Bitcoin‚Äôs 2020‚Äì2022 bull cycle and the ongoing rally. Trending Bitcoin Belives Hayes $250K Bitcoin forecast Trending Bitcoin Believes Hayes $250K Bitcoin forecast In the earlier cycle, Bitcoin accumulated between $8,000 and $12,000 throughout 2020 before breaking out in 2021 and peaking at $69,000, exactly as former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted.¬†The current cycle shows a similar structure, with a fresh breakout underway in 2025. Trending Bitcoin looks at the identical patterns, suggesting Hayes‚Äôs $250,000 forecasts are underway.¬†Notably, Peter Brandt had earlier predicted a $125K‚Äì$150K Bitcoin top by Q3 2025 if it regains its parabolic trendline, while Bernstein, Bitwise, and Robert Kiyosaki foresee a surge beyond $200K.",Analysis|Bitcoin Price Prediction,EN,0,prominent analyst note bitcoin retesting key trendline signaling possible continuation uptrend downward pull lower level post x crypto analyst michael noted bitcoin retesting trendline reaching new high bitcoin since declined high currently trading decline past day following drop past chart shared michael identifies trendline key structure historically influenced bitcoin market cycle sustained retest line could confirm bullish move failure may lead significance bitcoin trendlinefor context yellow ascending trendline began late cut several major price move first acted resistance late bull run bitcoin reached reappearing later cycle including bitcoin rose around rejected april crypto michael say bitcoin testing bullish zone crypto michael say bitcoin testing bullish zone although btc later broke line reaching new high move faltered early coinciding end cycle current chart show similar structure bitcoin broke trendline surged new high since pulled back retest level immediate level watch bitcoin bitcoin hold level close trendline could trigger upside however drop may resemble failed breakout seen bitcoin bearish move next similarly chart shared prominent trader ash crypto show bitcoin replicating bull run btc broke series descending channel vertical surge high ash crypto see bitcoin mirroing bull run ash crypto see bitcoin mirroring bull run price trading local low beneath resistance mirroring setup seen final rally ash crypto mention btc parabolic phase could verge another massive breakout potentially targeting coming new chart shared trending bitcoin also highlight similarity bitcoin bull cycle ongoing rally trending bitcoin belives hayes bitcoin forecast trending bitcoin belief hayes bitcoin forecast earlier cycle bitcoin accumulated throughout breaking peaking exactly former bitmex ceo arthur hayes predicted current cycle show similar structure fresh breakout underway trending bitcoin look identical pattern suggesting hayes forecast underway notably peter brandt earlier predicted bitcoin top regains parabolic trendline bernstein bitwise robert kiyosaki foresee surge beyond,0.103,0.709,0.188,0.9819,1

Trading Volumes Hold Up Strong According to trading data, daily turnover across all spot Bitcoin ETFs surged to $6.13 billion on the same day. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT alone accounted for $4.50 billion of that figure. Such high volume suggests that buyers and sellers are still very active. It points to a market where investors are fine-tuning positions rather than abandoning them. Futures, discounted funds like GBTC, or alternative crypto products could be where some capital is moving. Ethereum ETFs Break Inflow Streak Reports have disclosed that spot Ether ETFs ended a 20-day inflow streak with net outflows of $152 million last Friday. That streak was the longest the Ether products have ever seen. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE led the outflows with $47.68 million leaving the fund.

2025-08-04 09:00:12,49514245,1754298012,Crucial Ceffu ETH Transfer: Unpacking $82.64M ETH Movement to Binance,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Ceffu ETH Transfer: Unpacking $82.64M ETH Movement to Binance In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, every major movement of digital assets can spark significant interest and speculation. Recently, the crypto community observed a substantial Ceffu ETH transfer , with the institutional custody platform Ceffu moving a staggering 23,321 ETH, valued at approximately $82.64 million, to the global crypto exchange Binance. This significant transaction, reported by on-chain data shared by The Data Nerd on X, highlights the continuous evolution of institutional participation in the digital asset landscape and raises important questions about its implications for the broader market. Understanding the Ceffu ETH Transfer: What Happened and Why It Matters? The core of this news revolves around a large-scale movement of Ethereum (ETH) from Ceffu, a prominent institutional-grade custody solution, to Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Such a considerable Ceffu ETH transfer is not just a routine transaction; it signals potential strategic decisions by institutional players. For those closely watching the crypto space, these movements offer valuable insights into market sentiment, liquidity strategies, and the operational dynamics of major entities. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key elements: The Parties Involved: Ceffu, a robust institutional custody platform, and Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange known for its vast trading volumes and diverse services. The Asset: Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, widely used for decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi protocols. The Scale: A significant 23,321 ETH, equating to $82.64 million, indicating a substantial sum for any market participant, let alone an institutional one. The Action: A transfer from a secure custody solution to an exchange, which often precedes trading, staking, or other liquidity-generating activities. Why Does an Institutional ETH Transfer to Binance Generate Buzz? When an institutional entity like Ceffu makes a substantial ETH transfer to Binance , it naturally garners attention. Institutional transfers differ from retail transactions due to their scale and potential impact. They often reflect sophisticated strategies related to market making, asset management, or even preparations for new product launches. The destination, Binance, is equally important, as it offers deep liquidity and a wide range of services that institutions might leverage. Consider these points: Market Liquidity: Large inflows to exchanges can increase liquidity, potentially impacting trading pairs involving ETH. Strategic Intent: While the exact purpose remains speculative without further information, such transfers could be for OTC (Over-The-Counter) deals, staking, or even rebalancing portfolios. Trust and Compliance: Institutional custody platforms like Ceffu prioritize security and regulatory compliance, making their movements a testament to the maturing infrastructure supporting digital assets. Ceffu‚Äôs Role in the Crypto Ecosystem: Ensuring Secure Ceffu ETH Transfer Ceffu plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the nascent digital asset space. As an institutional-grade custody platform, Ceffu provides secure and compliant solutions for managing large quantities of cryptocurrencies. Their services are designed to meet the stringent security and regulatory requirements that institutional clients demand, making them a trusted partner for entities looking to engage with digital assets without compromising on safety. Key aspects of Ceffu‚Äôs operations include: Advanced Security Protocols: Utilizing multi-party computation (MPC) and cold storage solutions to protect assets from cyber threats. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to global regulatory standards, which is crucial for institutional adoption and trust. Operational Efficiency: Facilitating secure and efficient transfers, such as the recent Ceffu ETH transfer , enabling institutions to manage their digital asset portfolios effectively. The following table illustrates the distinction between institutional and retail crypto movements, highlighting why the former holds more weight in market analysis: Feature Institutional Transfer (e.g., Ceffu) Retail Transfer Volume Very High (Millions USD+) Low to Moderate (Hundreds to Thousands USD) Purpose Strategic (Trading, Staking, OTC, Rebalancing) Personal (Spending, Small Investments, Transfers) Security & Compliance Rigorous, Regulatory Focus User-Dependent, Less Formal Market Impact Significant, Can Influence Sentiment Minimal, Localized A secure Ceffu ETH transfer in action. Crucial Ceffu ETH Transfer: Unpacking $82.64M ETH Movement to Binance Potential Impacts of This Binance ETH Transfer: What Could Happen Next? The movement of such a substantial amount of ETH to Binance opens up several possibilities, each with its own set of implications for the broader crypto market. While it is impossible to predict the exact outcome, understanding the potential scenarios can help market participants better interpret future movements. Possible reasons for the Binance ETH transfer include: Increased Liquidity for Trading: The ETH could be intended for active trading, contributing to Binance‚Äôs liquidity pool and potentially impacting ETH‚Äôs price volatility. If the ETH is sold, it could exert downward pressure; if it‚Äôs for buying, it could indicate upward momentum. Staking Activities: Institutions might be moving ETH to Binance to participate in staking programs, leveraging Binance‚Äôs staking services to earn yields on their assets. This would lock up the ETH, potentially reducing circulating supply. Over-The-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional trades often occur off-exchange through OTC desks to avoid significant price slippage on public order books. Binance has robust OTC services that Ceffu clients might utilize. Portfolio Rebalancing: The transfer could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy, where ETH is being moved to adjust exposure to certain assets or prepare for new investments. For investors, such transfers serve as a reminder to monitor on-chain data and institutional movements as indicators of potential market shifts. While not direct signals for price action, they offer a glimpse into the confidence and strategies of major players. Navigating Institutional Crypto Movements: Challenges and Opportunities for Ceffu ETH Transfer The growing involvement of institutional players, exemplified by the frequent Ceffu ETH transfer activities, brings both challenges and opportunities to the cryptocurrency market. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in the digital asset space. Challenges: Market Volatility: Large institutional movements, if executed without proper planning, can sometimes lead to increased market volatility, especially for less liquid assets. Regulatory Scrutiny: As institutions enter the space, regulatory bodies pay closer attention, which can lead to new compliance burdens and potential restrictions. Information Asymmetry: Retail investors often lack the real-time, in-depth data available to institutional players, creating an information gap. Opportunities: Increased Legitimacy and Adoption: Institutional participation lends credibility to the crypto market, attracting more traditional investors and fostering broader adoption. Enhanced Liquidity: Large capital injections from institutions can significantly boost market liquidity, making it easier for all participants to trade assets. Development of Robust Infrastructure: The demand from institutions drives the development of more secure, compliant, and efficient infrastructure, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Innovation in Financial Products: Institutional interest spurs the creation of new financial products and services, such as sophisticated custody solutions, derivatives, and structured products. The ongoing interaction between institutional custody platforms like Ceffu and major exchanges like Binance is a testament to the maturing crypto landscape. These movements are not just about numbers; they represent the growing confidence and strategic engagement of significant capital in the digital economy. Conclusion: The Enduring Impact of Institutional Flows The recent Ceffu ETH transfer of $82.64 million to Binance is more than just an isolated event; it is a clear indicator of the deepening institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market. Such large-scale movements underscore the increasing sophistication and strategic depth with which major players are approaching digital assets. Whether these funds are intended for trading, staking, or other purposes, their presence on a major exchange like Binance highlights the critical role of liquidity and accessibility in the institutional crypto playbook. As the crypto market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these significant institutional flows will remain essential for understanding market trends and anticipating future developments. These transfers not only reflect current strategies but also pave the way for broader adoption and the integration of digital assets into the global financial system.

While it operates as an independent entity focused on institutional clients, it maintains a close relationship with Binance, facilitating secure asset management and transfers within the broader ecosystem.

2025-08-04 09:00:09,49514185,1754298009,DWF Ventures Publishes Analysis of SocialFi Token Creation App Zora,"August 4, 2025 ‚Äì Dubai, United Arab Emirates Web 3.0 investor and ecosystem builder DWF Ventures has published an analysis of Zora, the token creation app that‚Äôs emerged as a competitor to Pump.fun and Bonk. In the report, DWF Ventures examines the rise of Zora to become a cornerstone of the creator economy, launching 1.5 million tokens and generating $420 million in volume. DWF Ventures‚Äô detailed assessment of Zora charts the rise of the platform, which lies at the intersection of the token launchpad and SocialFi sectors. It details its rapid growth and assesses its prospects of maintaining momentum and claiming market share from competitors such as Pump.fun. Built on Base, Zora‚Äôs social app is made for the new creator economy. Every post and profile it contains is an instantly tradable ERC20 token, incentivizing users to create original content that will resonate with Zora‚Äôs community. Creators earn one-percent of every trade, ensuring that users are fairly remunerated for the content they post and memes they make. As DWF Ventures explains, Zora creators can post content in the form of photos, art or ideas, which users are able to mint for a period of time. Once the mint duration, which usually lasts three days, concludes, the market begins. A small percentage of initial mint fees is used to bootstrap liquidity, while creators can claim a portion of fees from the liquidity pool. Core features identified by DWF Ventures that have attributed to Zora‚Äôs success include built-in creator royalties, global and programmable liquidity and its permissionless onchain markets, which mark a significant improvement over version one of the app in which off-chain secondary marketplaces had to be used for selling and post-minting. While Zora-related onchain activity has diminished slightly from its April high, DWF Ventures notes that it has picked up notably in the past week with a significant increase in daily created tokens, unique creators, trading volume and rewards. The uptick in these metrics has pushed Zora past $420 million in lifetime volume and $3.4 million in rewards. In its report, DWF Ventures examines the similarities and differences between Zora and memecoin launchpads such as Pump.fun and Bonk. All three platforms utilize a bonding curve prior to DEX migration and are highly speculative in nature given that tokens have little to no intrinsic value. However, Zora‚Äôs deployment on Base, coupled with its SocialFi features, give it a unique distribution channel and differentiate it from its Solana-based rivals. DWF Ventures goes on to examine the novel design of Zora‚Äôs reward system that ensures all content creators have an opportunity to earn ‚Äì not just influencers with large followings. This design also feeds into its native token, which has been programmed with a strong value accrual mechanism because a portion of all value generated flows into ZORA. The report concludes by considering Zora‚Äôs prospects of becoming a major player in the growing SocialFi sector or whether its novelty will wear off as users seek new experiences and fresh opportunities. DWF Ventures finishes by stating that ‚Äúwe are excited for the SocialFi sector and its journey to becoming mainstream,‚Äù before inviting projects building interesting SocialFi solutions to reach out to them.

According to Wedson, a structure consistent with the ‚ÄúWyckoff Distribution Scheme‚Äù is forming in the market, and this is a sign of weakening in Bitcoin. The analyst expressed his thoughts in his statement as follows: Billionaires don't just get rich during booms. They build their wealth in two primary stages: accumulation and distribution. Bitcoin's chart is currently showing clear signs of a short-term distribution. Related News: Watch Out: There are a Lot of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up Next Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List According to Wedson, market makers are shifting from BTC to altcoins during this period.

2025-08-04 09:00:00,49514215,1754298000,Metaplanet Buys 463 Bitcoin to Start August,"The company is aggressively pursuing a goal to accumulate 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply by 2027 and is funding its strategy through a $3.73 billion preferred share issuance, following a model that was made popular by Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also seeing serious corporate accumulation. SharpLink added 30,755 ETH over the weekend, pushing its total to 480,031 ETH. The Ether Machine also bought 15,000 ETH, surpassing the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs holdings. Metaplanet Snaps Up More BTC Japanese investment firm Metaplanet bought 463 Bitcoin for approximately 8 billion yen ($53.7 million), and became the first public company to take advantage of Bitcoin‚Äôs 5% weekend dip . The acquisition was announced on Monday, and brings Metaplanet‚Äôs total holdings to 17,595 BTC, which is now valued at over $2 billion. This makes Metaplanet the world‚Äôs seventh-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The company paid an average price of around $115,895 per Bitcoin for this latest buy . The move took place on the heels of a big wave of institutional interest in late July, when 16 firms reportedly added more than $7.8 billion worth of crypto to their treasuries. However, the start of August has been less favorable for institutional inflows, with US spot Bitcoin ETFs seeing $812.3 million in outflows. This was one of the largest single-day pullbacks in history. Against this backdrop, Metaplanet‚Äôs aggressive stance means that it still has confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value proposition, despite the tightening macroeconomic conditions. Metaplanet has laid out an ambitious target to accumulate 210,000 BTC ‚Äî1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply‚Äîby the end of 2027. The latest purchase puts the firm at 8.4% of its goal. In an echo of Michael Saylor‚Äôs playbook at Strategy, Metaplanet is funding its Bitcoin purchases through the issuance of perpetual preferred shares. On Friday, it announced plans to issue $3.73 billion worth of such shares. THis method was popularized by Saylor‚Äôs firm to raise capital without incurring debt or diluting existing shareholders. Saylor famously described Strategy‚Äôs preferred stock issuance under ticker STRC as the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúiPhone moment‚Äù after it raised $2.5 billion. Similarly, Metaplanet‚Äôs offering will pay up to a 6% annual dividend, depending on market conditions and investor appetite. The preferred equity model has become a powerful tool for corporate Bitcoin buyers, as it allows for long-term capital allocation to BTC without the financial strain of traditional debt. The corporate Bitcoin race is certainly intensifying. While Metaplanet still trails heavyweights like Strategy, Mara Holdings, XXI, Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, Riot Platforms, and Trump Media, it is a very strong contender. The number of public companies holding Bitcoin surged to 162 in early August, up from 112 just a few months earlier, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . Companies holding Bitcoin (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) With more firms now entering the space and adopting innovative financial structures to back their Bitcoin strategies, corporate accumulation shows no signs of slowing down. Ether Machine and SharpLink Stack ETH Corporate buying momentum is also growing for Ethereum. SharpLink recently intensified its Ethereum accumulation strategy by adding 15,822 ETH worth approximately $53.9 million, according to on-chain data . The purchases were spread across multiple transactions, with the largest single transfer totaling 6,914 ETH, valued at $23.56 million. This aggressive buying spree brings SharpLink‚Äôs total ETH holdings to 480,031 ETH, which is currently worth around $1.65 billion. Over the weekend alone, SharpLink spent $108.57 million in USDC to buy 30,755 ETH at an average price of $3,530. On Thursday, the company also executed a purchase of 11,259 ETH for $43.09 million, averaging $3,828 per ETH. This sustained buying activity proves just how much conviction the company has in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term value. Meanwhile, The Ether Machine continued its own accumulation by purchasing 15,000 ETH for $56.9 million at an average price of $3,809. The timing of the acquisition coincided with Ethereum‚Äôs 10th anniversary. With this latest move, The Ether Machine‚Äôs holdings increased to 334,757 ETH, placing it ahead of the Ethereum Foundation, which holds 234,000 ETH. The company now ranks as the third-largest corporate holder of Ether, trailing only SharpLink and BitMine. The Ether Machine was formed through a merger with Nasdaq-listed Dynamix Corp. earlier this year, and is targeting a $1.6 billion capital raise. It also plans to go public under the ticker ETHM later in 2025. The surge in corporate Ethereum accumulation is part of the shift in how companies are thinking about their digital asset strategies. According to NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef , corporations are increasingly seeing Ethereum not just as a passive investment but as critical infrastructure for the digital economy. Youssef pointed out Ethereum‚Äôs unique appeal as a hybrid between technology equity and digital currency, offering staking yields, programmability, and a growing alignment with regulatory frameworks. With Ethereum now hosting a majority of tokenized assets and stablecoins, its role as the reserve currency for tokenized finance is very quickly solidifying.

2025-08-04 08:57:59,49515861,1754297879,Is this $0.035 token the next SOL? Analysts and insiders predict $5 by 2026,"Today, many analysts are seeing familiar patterns emerge in a new project: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At just $0.035 during its presale Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance is being touted as the next big breakout, this time led not just by infrastructure, but by pure financial utility. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike Solana (SOL)‚Äôs focus on general blockchain scalability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out a decentralized finance ecosystem that integrates peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models, a stablecoin framework, and mtToken staking that generates passive income. These aren‚Äôt future aspirations‚Äîthe foundational elements of this financial ecosystem are already in testing environments and expected to be fully operational at launch. Where Solana (SOL) offered speed and efficiency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to deliver scalable financial products with real economic value to users from day one. The project‚Äôs ability to blend flexible lending with yield generation gives it a strong edge. Through its P2C system, users will lend assets into shared liquidity pools to earn APY based on real-time utilization. Meanwhile, borrowers will be able to lock blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, or stablecoins at specific loan-to-value ratios and receive instant overcollateralized loans. The P2P mechanism will open a parallel lane where users can directly negotiate terms on more volatile tokens like DOGE, PEPE, SHIB, TRUMP and BONK, enhancing returns at the cost of higher risk. Both models are designed to function alongside the protocol‚Äôs upcoming stablecoin, which will be issued and maintained through controlled smart contract logic. Presale momentum and institutional confidence Currently in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 with 10% of its 170 million token allocation already sold. More than 14,800 holders have joined the journey, contributing over $13.9 million so far. With the next price jump to $0.040 on the horizon‚Äîa 15% increase‚Äîthe urgency is mounting for retail and institutional players alike. Once listing occurs, early buyers from Phase 1, who entered at $0.01, are on track to see 6x returns, while those stepping in during Phase 6 are still in position for significant upside before the $0.06 listing price is even reached. Security is another pillar where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance is gaining attention. With a 95.00 CertiK Token Scan score and a 78.00 Skynet Score, the project already shows robust smart contract integrity and operational safety. In partnership with CertiK, the platform is also running a $50,000 bug bounty program to ensure airtight protections as development continues. This level of diligence is rarely seen pre-launch and is fostering trust among larger whales and analysts alike. More visibility is also building through Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs strong community presence, with 12,000+ Twitter followers and steady engagement around the project‚Äôs roadmap and upcoming Beta launch. Unlike many presale tokens that offer only a promise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to deliver an interactive Beta platform upon listing, giving users a hands-on experience with lending, borrowing, and staking mechanics from day one. This real-world usability, paired with low fees thanks to planned Layer-2 blockchain integration, means congestion issues like those that plagued early Ethereum-based DeFi won‚Äôt be a roadblock here. Final words Once the token hits top-tier exchanges like MEXC, KuCoin, and others, price discovery will escalate. At that stage, comparisons between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and established protocols like Aave (AAVE) or Compound (COMP) will begin to unfold in real time, and the market will start pricing in future dominance. With a total token supply of 4 billion, visibility alone could elevate the price into multi-dollar territory. At $5, the token would still represent only a fraction of the market cap of larger DeFi players‚Äîyet the return for current investors would already rival Solana (SOL)‚Äôs legendary run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not positioning itself as a copy of any existing DeFi platform. It is introducing new mechanics, merging decentralized lending, stablecoin economics, and staking incentives into one streamlined protocol. That combination is what has analysts confidently calling for a rise to $5 by 2026. For those who missed Solana (SOL) at $0.50, this is the moment to act, not reflect.

2025-08-04 08:57:39,49515859,1754297859,4 tokens under $0.50 to add to your portfolio today: big potential like 2021 SHIB and FLOKI,"The cryptocurrency market is again heating up, and savvy investors are hunting for the next Shiba Inu or Floki Inu. In 2021, SHIB surged by over 45 million percent, while FLOKI saw more than 10,000% gains from its presale. In mid-2025, a fresh crop of under-the-radar tokens under $0.50 shows similar potential. Among them, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) stands out as a breakout candidate, now officially listed on CoinMarketCap and backed by analysts projecting gains of up to 10,000%. Here‚Äôs a closer look at four tokens with explosive upside. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): zero market cap advantage, analysts predict 10,000% surge As of writing, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is in Stage 8 of its presale at just $0.0017 per token, with over $12.9 million already raised out of a $13.77 million cap. With a listing price of $0.003, early buyers can double their money on launch alone‚Äîbut analysts believe that‚Äôs just the beginning. LILPEPE is not just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a Layer 2 blockchain project with tangible utility, blazing-fast speeds, zero gas tax, and deep meme culture embedded in its DNA. With its EVM-compatible chain in development, LILPEPE aims to go far beyond what SHIB or FLOKI attempted, offering ultra-low fees, lightning-fast finality, and full decentralization. LILPEPE‚Äôs zero market cap advantage at launch sets it apart, giving it an immense runway for explosive growth. Backed by a passionate community, a stacked marketing budget, and clear technical utility, LILPEPE is already drawing whale interest and institutional eyes. The current circulating supply upon launch will be just 20% of the total supply, with a carefully designed vesting schedule to prevent dumping and foster long-term sustainability. In celebration of its momentum, LILPEPE has launched a $777,000 giveaway , where 10 winners will each receive $77,000 in tokens, creating even more buzz. With over 152,000 entries already recorded and the token officially listed on CoinMarketCap, visibility and investor confidence are soaring. LILPEPE is this cycle‚Äôs SHIB moment for many analysts, with growth potential exceeding 10,000% from presale to peak. And at just $0.0017 today, the window of maximum opportunity may be closing soon. Sei (SEI): the fastest EVM chain yet Nicknamed the ‚ÄúSolana of 2025,‚Äù SEI is a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for decentralized trading. As of writing, SEI trades for under $0.50, but it‚Äôs up 100% in July alone‚Äîand there are strong reasons to believe the rally is just beginning. SEI boasts a groundbreaking 400ms finality and throughput of up to 250,000 transactions per second, making it the fastest EVM chain. With Circle investing heavily and Wyoming‚Äôs potential fiat stablecoin launch on SEI, institutional adoption is underway. Its architecture mirrors centralized exchange speed while maintaining full decentralization‚Äîan ideal combination for DeFi, gaming, and NFT ecosystems. As TVL passes $600 million, early investors are eyeing returns that mirror Solana‚Äôs meteoric 2021 rise. Flare (FLR): interoperability that attracts institutions Flare (FLR) is quietly building a bridge across blockchain worlds. As of writing, FLR trades at $0.0243, down slightly on the day, but still commanding a $1.7 billion market cap. While modestly priced, FLR‚Äôs underlying value lies in its interoperability-first architecture, enabling secure Web2 and external chain data access. With FTSOv2 enhancing its oracle capabilities and VivoPower deploying $100 million in XRP through Flare‚Äôs network, the blockchain is becoming a hub for real-world institutional yield generation. This utility, combined with growing DeFi tools like TrustSwap‚Äôs SparkDEX launchpad, gives FLR a unique niche. Analysts estimate 2027 highs of $0.045, nearly double its current price, with continued growth expected as cross-chain connectivity becomes the standard. Pepe Coin (PEPE): breakout technicals and whale accumulation PEPE is staging a quiet comeback, and smart money is noticing. Currently priced at $0.00001258, PEPE has surged 77% since June, with bullish signals lighting up across charts. A Golden Cross formation‚Äîwhere the 50-day EMA crosses the 200-day EMA‚Äîsuggests a powerful rally could be imminent. On-chain data confirms over 840 billion tokens accumulated by whales in recent weeks, while exchange supply is falling, indicating long-term conviction among big holders. With Ethereum gaining ground‚Äîhistorically a tailwind for ERC-20 meme coins‚ÄîPEPE may soon hit $0.0000208, possibly higher. It‚Äôs a stealthy setup reminiscent of its original 2023 breakout, with stronger fundamentals and broader awareness.

2025-08-04 08:55:10,49514094,1754297710,Ethereum Price Prediction: Korean Investors Unveil Astounding ETH All-Time High Confidence,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price Prediction: Korean Investors Unveil Astounding ETH All-Time High Confidence The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with anticipation, and nowhere is this more evident than in the vibrant South Korean market. Recent findings from a comprehensive survey have cast a spotlight on investor sentiment, particularly concerning the future of Ethereum. The standout revelation? An astounding 64.2% of Korean crypto investors are confidently predicting that Ethereum (ETH) will reach a new all-time high before the year concludes. This significant Ethereum Price Prediction reflects a strong bullish outlook, setting the stage for potential excitement in the coming months. What‚Äôs Driving the Latest Ethereum Price Prediction Among Korean Investors? Understanding the factors influencing this optimistic Ethereum Price Prediction requires a closer look at the broader market sentiment among South Korean investors. A weekly trend survey, collaboratively conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos from July 29 to August 1, provides valuable insights into these shifting perspectives. While Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) short-term outlook saw a slight dip in bullishness compared to the previous week, the overall market mood still leans towards positivity, especially for altcoins. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the Bitcoin market expectations from the survey: Increased Volatility: Only 37% of respondents expected Bitcoin‚Äôs value to increase or significantly jump this week. This was a decrease from 49.4% in the prior week, suggesting a more cautious short-term view on BTC. Market Stability: A larger segment, 34.2%, anticipated a stable market, an increase from 28.2% previously. This indicates a desire for consolidation rather than immediate explosive growth for Bitcoin. Potential Decline: Conversely, 28.8% predicted a decline or sharp drop, up from 22.4%. This growing segment of skepticism adds a layer of complexity to the overall market outlook. Despite these varied short-term views on Bitcoin, the underlying sentiment for Ethereum appears to be much stronger, underpinning the robust Ethereum Price Prediction . How Does Current Market Sentiment Impact Ethereum Price Prediction? The general mood of the market is a critical component in forecasting price movements. The survey also gauged the overall sentiment among Korean crypto investors, revealing a mix of optimism and caution. This nuanced sentiment directly influences the confidence behind any Ethereum Price Prediction . Let‚Äôs examine the prevailing market sentiments: Market Sentiment Percentage of Respondents Optimism or Extreme Optimism 39% Neutral 38% Fear or Extreme Fear 23% While nearly 40% express optimism, a significant portion remains neutral or fearful. This indicates that while a strong bullish contingent exists, the market isn‚Äôt uniformly euphoric. However, the specific conviction regarding Ethereum‚Äôs future performance suggests that ETH is seen as a potential outlier, capable of achieving new heights regardless of broader short-term fluctuations in Bitcoin or general market apprehension. This distinct view solidifies the ambitious Ethereum Price Prediction . Are Korean Investors Bullish on Ethereum‚Äôs Price Prediction for an Altcoin Season? Ethereum‚Äôs recent strong performance is frequently considered a harbinger of an approaching ‚Äòaltcoin season,‚Äô a period where alternative cryptocurrencies see significant gains. The survey specifically probed investors‚Äô views on this correlation and, more importantly, their belief in Ethereum‚Äôs capacity to hit new milestones. The results provide compelling evidence for the widespread belief in a positive Ethereum Price Prediction . The findings are clear: Overwhelming Confidence: A dominant 64.2% of those surveyed expressed their expectation for ETH to reach a new all-time high before the end of the year. This strong conviction highlights the perceived strength and potential of Ethereum in the current market cycle. Skeptical Minority: Conversely, 35.8% were more skeptical, indicating they do not believe ETH will achieve an all-time high this year. This minority view provides a balanced perspective, acknowledging the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the crypto market. This overwhelming majority expecting a new ETH all-time high underscores a significant belief among Korean investors that Ethereum is poised for substantial growth. It suggests that many are positioning themselves for an altcoin rally, with ETH leading the charge. This collective belief fuels the robust Ethereum Price Prediction observed in the survey. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities for Ethereum‚Äôs Price Prediction? While the survey highlights strong optimism for Ethereum‚Äôs Price Prediction , it‚Äôs crucial to consider both the potential opportunities and the inherent challenges that could influence its trajectory. The path to a new all-time high is rarely straightforward in the volatile crypto landscape. Opportunities: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum‚Äôs robust ecosystem, including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions, continues to expand, driving demand for ETH as gas fees and a store of value. Upcoming Upgrades: Future protocol upgrades, aimed at improving scalability and efficiency, could significantly enhance Ethereum‚Äôs utility and attractiveness, positively impacting its price. Institutional Adoption: Increasing institutional interest and investment in Ethereum-based products could provide substantial buying pressure. Altcoin Season Catalyst: As a bellwether for the altcoin market, a strong ETH performance could ignite broader altcoin rallies, further cementing its leadership position. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving global cryptocurrency regulations could introduce unforeseen hurdles for the market, potentially impacting Ethereum‚Äôs Price Prediction . Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic factors, such as inflation, interest rate hikes, or global recession fears, can dampen investor appetite for risk assets like crypto. Competition: Emerging Layer-1 blockchains continue to compete for market share, though Ethereum maintains a significant first-mover advantage and network effect. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market means that even strong bullish sentiment can be quickly challenged by unexpected price swings or market corrections. Navigating these factors will be key to realizing the ambitious Ethereum Price Prediction put forth by Korean investors. Actionable Insights from This Ethereum Price Prediction Survey For both seasoned and new investors, this survey offers valuable insights beyond just the numbers. The collective sentiment of a significant market like South Korea can often provide an early indicator of broader trends. Here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor ETH Closely: Given the strong confidence, Ethereum should be a top asset to watch. Its performance could indeed signal the start of a wider altcoin rally. Diversify and Rebalance: While optimism for ETH is high, the mixed sentiment for Bitcoin and the general market suggests prudence. Diversifying portfolios and rebalancing periodically can help manage risk. Stay Informed on Fundamentals: Beyond price predictions, understanding Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing developments, such as network upgrades and ecosystem growth, is crucial for long-term investment decisions. Consider Risk Management: Even with high expectations, the crypto market remains unpredictable. Setting stop-losses and only investing what one can afford to lose are fundamental risk management strategies. The strong conviction around Ethereum‚Äôs Price Prediction from Korean investors provides a compelling narrative for the remainder of the year. Summary: The Astounding Ethereum Price Prediction from Korea The recent survey of South Korean cryptocurrency investors provides a fascinating glimpse into the market‚Äôs evolving landscape.

2025-08-04 08:54:01,49514005,1754297641,"Google Gemini Sets Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for August 31, 2025","Google‚Äôs artificial intelligence platform, Gemini, has issued a cautious outlook on the performance of Shiba Inu (SHIB) for the remainder of August 2025. The AI model assessed current market structure, technical signals, and broader on-chain trends to form its latest projection for the popular meme-based cryptocurrency. As Shiba Inu continues to struggle with downside pressure, Google Gemini has outlined several critical risk factors that could weigh further on price performance throughout the month. Technical Weakness Threatens SHIB‚Äôs Key Support Gemini notes that SHIB‚Äôs recent decline in both daily trading volume and investor engagement indicates weakening bullish momentum. The token has seen a drop of over 2.8% in the past 24 hours, now trading at $0.00001196. Price activity has remained confined to a narrow range with mounting pressure on the $0.000011 support area. Analysts across multiple platforms have flagged the risk of a breakdown at this level, with no reversal signals yet visible on the weekly chart. Gemini Predicts Drop to $0.00001 by August 31 In its official forecast, Google Gemini predicts that SHIB could fall by approximately 16.388% by the end of August, potentially reaching $0.00001 by August 31. The AI model attributes this anticipated decline to a convergence of bearish signals. ‚ÄúThere is an increased risk of Shiba Inu breaking below its support range near $0.000011 due to deteriorating volume, lower on-chain engagement, and the recent stall in burning activity. Unless fresh buying pressure returns or a major catalyst emerges, a move toward the $0.00001 level is increasingly likely before the end of August,‚Äù Gemini stated in its analysis. Gemini‚Äôs assessment echoes broader sentiment from other market analysts. According to recent reports, SHIB has failed to produce any clear bullish reversal pattern and remains under technical resistance. A sustained failure to hold above $0.00001188 may open the door to further retracement toward $0.00001141 or lower. These thresholds align with Gemini‚Äôs projected downside target and reinforce concerns about the token‚Äôs weakening structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On-Chain Metrics Signal Declining Market Engagement Beyond technicals, on-chain data reveals a significant decline in new wallet activity, which has dropped by nearly 40% over the past ten days. While the retention rate among SHIB holders remains high, the reduction in new address generation signals a lack of fresh market participants, reducing organic demand for the token. Google Gemini emphasized that this trend erodes market support and amplifies vulnerability to short-term selling. Another factor highlighted in the analysis is the declining burn rate of SHIB tokens . With burn activity falling by over 50% compared to previous levels, the narrative of long-term scarcity has weakened. Gemini notes that the reduction in token destruction has tempered enthusiasm among speculative holders who previously viewed burning as a key mechanism to drive future value. Market Lacks Immediate Catalysts to Reverse Trend The overall market environment also presents a few supportive conditions for meme tokens at this stage of the cycle. Despite some strength in major cryptocurrencies, SHIB and other speculative assets have failed to show sustained interest or significant whale accumulation. Without a new catalyst, such as a major partnership or exchange listing, SHIB may struggle to attract momentum-driven buyers in the near term. In light of these combined elements‚Äîtechnical vulnerability, weakening user growth, reduced burn rates, and an absence of short-term catalysts- Google Gemini maintains its projected target of $0.00001 for Shiba Inu by August 31, representing a forecasted decline of over 16%.

2025-08-04 08:53:43,49514542,1754297623,MUTM prediction to 2030: Your $50 lunch money could become $100K,"Phase 6 of the 11-phase presale is actively underway. Tokens are selling rapidly at $0.035 each. This price marks a significant 250% increase from the opening phase price of $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out quickly. Consequently, the chance to acquire tokens at this low price is diminishing. Phase 7 will open soon, bringing a 14.3% price hike to $0.04 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will list officially at $0.06. Buying tokens now guarantees a minimum 71% return on investment at launch. This price prediction explores the potential for massive future gains, drawing parallels with historical crypto surges. Crypto investment potential here appears substantial. MUTM presale momentum and projected value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating impressive presale traction. The current Phase 6 price sits at $0.035. Investors purchasing now secure tokens significantly below the planned $0.06 listing price. This immediate upside potential is attracting considerable capital. Projections beyond the listing price are emerging. Based on its unique dual-lending model, Layer-2 efficiency reducing transaction costs, and capped 4 billion token supply, analysts foresee substantial appreciation. Moreover, a realistic post-launch target within the next few years could reach $3.50. Achieving this price point would transform a modest $50 investment today into over $5,000. Crypto predictions often hinge on utility and adoption; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses on real-world DeFi lending solutions. Security foundations are robust. The team finalized its CertiK audit successfully, achieving a 95.00 security score. This indicates a solid security posture. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance launched its official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. They allocated $50,000 USDT for rewards across four severity tiers. Community engagement is high, highlighted by an active $100,000 MUTM giveaway split among ten winners. Mutuum Finance also introduced a dashboard featuring a leaderboard. In addition, the top 50 holders will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. These factors contribute positively to long-term crypto investment appeal. MUTM long-term price trajectory to 2030 Reaching the $100,000 milestone from a $50 investment demands substantial growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) possesses core attributes that could fuel such appreciation. Case in point, Shiba Inu (SHIB) offers a relevant case study. SHIB traded at an incredibly low price point in 2020. Its value hovered around $0.00000000051. Few investors noticed it then. SHIB peaked near $0.00008816 within roughly one year. This represented an astronomical return exceeding 16,900,000% for the earliest holders. Should Mutuum Finance capture a meaningful share of the expanding DeFi lending market, further price discovery is likely. Reaching $10 per token by 2030 becomes a plausible scenario under sustained growth. This price level would multiply an initial $50 Phase 6 investment into over $14,000. Achieving $35 per MUTM by 2030, while ambitious, is not inconceivable given the total addressable market. This price would catapult the $50 lunch money investment beyond $100,000. Such crypto predictions depend heavily on widespread adoption, consistent protocol revenue, and favorable overall crypto market conditions. The project‚Äôs focus on solving real DeFi challenges positions it well. Crypto prices today reflect early confidence; future valuations will hinge on delivered utility. Capitalizing on the MUTM opportunity now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a tangible opportunity within the current presale window. Phase 6 offers tokens at $0.035, the last stage before another price rise. The project combines technological promise with strong early validation. Its successful CertiK audit and active bug bounty program enhance trust. The significant funds raised and growing holder base signal market belief. Crypto investment always carries inherent risks. However, the combination of immediate presale upside, a clear utility-driven model, and long-term growth potential makes MUTM noteworthy. Explore the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale today to potentially transform modest capital into significant future value. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price prediction to 2030 highlights this substantial possibility.

2025-08-04 08:51:46,49514540,1754297506,"DOGE could touch $0.5, but MUTM is poised to be the next crypto to hit $1","Investors securing tokens now anticipate a 71% profit at the $0.06 launch. Over $14,000,000 has been raised. More than 665 million tokens have already been sold. Total MUTM holders now exceed 14,800. This project demonstrates clear utility and strong early backing. Dogecoin price analysis and $0.50 target Dogecoin is battling near its 200-day EMA around $0.20. Holding this level is crucial for bullish continuation. Analysts observe historical rebounds from this zone. Technical charts suggest a possible bull flag pattern forming. The RSI indicator rebounded sharply from oversold territory recently. This signals renewed buying interest. Furthermore, the MACD hints at a potential golden cross. Such a cross often precedes short-term price surges. Reclaiming $0.22 resistance is vital for confirming upside potential. Success could propel DOGE towards $0.245 and then $0.28. Sustained momentum might even fuel a push to $0.376. Speculation about spot DOGE ETFs adds further upside pressure. Achieving the $0.50 mark remains plausible yet highly dependent on market sentiment and technical holds. Crypto prices remain volatile. Mutuum Finance presale momentum and security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating its sixth presale phase. Tokens are available now for $0.035. This phase is selling out quickly. Phase 7 will start soon, increasing the price by 14.3% to $0.04. Buying before this hike guarantees immediate paper gains. The project will launch officially at $0.06. This offers current buyers a confirmed 71% return on investment. Early participants have already tripled their capital. Significant funds fuel this momentum: $14,000,000 raised and 665M tokens sold. Security is paramount for Mutuum Finance. Moreover, the team finalized its CertiK audit successfully. Certik‚Äôs audit awarded a 95.00 security score. This indicates robust smart contract integrity. No vulnerabilities were found. Additionally, no security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. Mutuum Finance launched its official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. A $50,000 USDT reward pool exists for finding flaws. Crypto investing demands such rigorous safety measures. The project also introduced a dashboard featuring a leaderboard. The top 50 holders earn bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. This incentivizes long-term holding. MUTM utility, growth potential, and giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers tangible utility within decentralized finance. Its core is a dual-lending platform combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Users tokenize assets like ETH or BTC in P2C, earning interest via mtTokens.

2025-08-04 08:51:13,49514538,1754297473,This token priced below $0.002 could outperform DOGE and ADA in 2025,"In the fast-moving crypto scene, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) have been solid names for a while. However, a new meme coin is now turning heads and trading for less than $0.002‚Äîmaking it a bargain for savvy investors. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is picking up steam and is on track to outpace Dogecoin and Cardano in the next bull run. Here‚Äôs why Little Pepe could grow like wildfire and why it might leave its older rivals in the dust. A Jaw-Dropping Price Below $0.002: Grab It While You Can Currently, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is available for just $0.0017 in Stage 8 of its presale, having already raised $12.9 million. When you stack that next to Dogecoin at $0.23 and Cardano at about $0.83, the difference becomes obvious: Little Pepe is way cheaper and still tiny. This kind of price allows you to jump in on a meme coin just before it gains momentum and potentially rockets in value. Analysts believe Little Pepe has the potential to reward early investors handsomely, with some predicting its value could skyrocket by 30 times as it attracts more users and gains solid market recognition. The strong presale, rising interest, and an excited, supportive community all suggest this token is perfect for anyone aiming to profit before the price really takes off. Real utility and tech that sets Little Pepe ahead Where Dogecoin started as a joke and Cardano still fights for wider use, Little Pepe packs genuine value into the meme coin world. By utilizing Ethereum‚Äôs Layer-2 solution, Little Pepe enables super-fast transactions and low fees, instantly addressing the congestion and high gas bills that hinder many Ethereum projects. But there‚Äôs more. Little Pepe is not riding meme hype alone; it‚Äôs crafting a real ecosystem around the token. Pepe‚Äôs Pump Pad, a bot-proof launchpad for launching new meme coins, is helping create a solid, ongoing platform for fresh tokens, which pumps up Little Pepe‚Äôs longer-term growth. This ecosystem-first and utility-minded focus gives Little Pepe a clear advantage over Dogecoin and Cardano, both still figuring out scaling and real-world use. Community engagement: Little Pepe‚Äôs $777K giveaway is live! Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is kicking things into high gear with a $777,000 giveaway to celebrate its launch! Ten fortunate winners will each walk away with $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens, and the party has just begun. Here‚Äôs how to jump in: 1. Enter your ERC20 wallet address. 2. Complete all quests and social tasks listed. 3. Refer friends for +25 bonus entries per friend. Please note that you must invest at least $100 in the Little Pepe presale to qualify. The hype is real: over 152,000 entries have rolled in, and there are still 65 days to go. The giveaway is picking up serious speed. Additionally, the team has incorporated a tight vesting schedule that locks up tokens for major investors. This means no sudden sell-offs, allowing healthy price growth and a tight-knit, engaged community to form. Join now: littlepepe.com The upcoming exchange listings: a game-changer One of the biggest testaments to Little Pepe‚Äôs legitimacy and long-term upside is that it has already secured seats on major centralized exchanges (CEX). The CoinMarketCap listing is just a warm-up‚ÄîLittle Pepe is slated to go live on two top-tier CEXs as soon as the presale wraps. And the plan doesn‚Äôt stop there: the team is also lining up a listing on the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, locking the token even tighter into the global market. This early buzz and planned exchange rollout can spark major demand, driving Little Pepe‚Äôs price even higher. With the token becoming available to a much broader audience, the chances of price appreciation skyrocket. That makes it a serious contender for anyone scouting the next crypto superstar. Dogecoin and Cardano‚Äôs struggles: why Little Pepe could lead the way Dogecoin and Cardano may be household names, but both are showing cracks that could trip up future growth: Dogecoin still rides the meme wave, but that status doesn‚Äôt build value. Without real utility and a solid tech stack, it risks becoming just another speculative play, rather than a long-term asset anyone can depend on. Cardano is undeniably cutting-edge, but it‚Äôs having a tough time getting more users and activity on its network. Even after some major updates, its growth has been slow, and people are trading and using it less than they were a few years ago. Little Pepe is leading the meme coin movement by combining meme magic and real-world usefulness. Its fast Ethereum Layer-2 rollup, real staking rewards, and active community make Little Pepe a viable challenger with an opportunity to expand. Conclusion: Little Pepe could outperform Dogecoin and Cardano in 2025 For wise investors, Little Pepe shines. Currently, it costs less than two-tenths of a cent, making it affordable for anyone to purchase a stack. The team is packing its Layer-2 Ethereum software with real-world use cases, rather than hype, to speed up and lower transaction costs. Growing within a loyal and lively community is ideal. If you want a little investment with tremendous upside or to catch the next meme coin wave, Little Pepe should be on your 2025 watch list.

2025-08-04 08:50:18,49524781,1754297418,VanEck Says Bitcoin Would Reach Half the Value of Physical Gold,"VanEck CEO Jan van Eck has reiterated his bullish outlook for Bitcoin, projecting that it would rival gold in the near future. Van Eck told Bloomberg on August 1 that Bitcoin is digital gold, a sentiment that is slowly becoming a norm in the global market. He suggested that this emerging narrative would see Bitcoin compete with gold and could claim a considerable chunk of its market cap.Bitcoin to Claim Half of Gold‚Äôs Market Cap: Van EckBloomberg host Matt Miller highlighted the unwavering belief from VanEck executives in Bitcoin even during the crypto winter. He asked van Eck why his firm believed so much in Bitcoin, and the CEO noted that it was because it is the digital version of gold, the most valuable asset in the world.Van Eck suggested that Bitcoin would rise to that status at some point in its existence. Specifically, he noted that BTC would claim half of gold‚Äôs valuation, pushing its price to $400,000 per token.Meanwhile, gold‚Äôs current valuation paints a more bullish picture for Bitcoin. Gold trades at $3,414 today and has a market cap of $22.9 trillion. If BTC attains half of gold‚Äôs current value, it would assume a valuation of $11.45 trillion, culminating in a price of $545,238 at a total supply of 21 million.Interestingly, van Eck is not the only one insisting that Bitcoin is maturing into a rival to gold. Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego projected a few months back that Bitcoin would match gold‚Äôs $22 trillion market cap, citing a future where the crypto leader becomes the reserve asset for nations.Also, a recent survey also points to Bitcoin's demonetization of gold in the US. The report shows that more people now hold Bitcoin over gold in America, marking a shift in investment preference in favor of the pioneering cryptocurrency.VanEck CEO Lauds Stablecoin PassageMeanwhile, during his Bloomberg interview, Van Eck further highlighted the passage of the stablecoin bill as another development for Bitcoin and the crypto industry that would drive mass adoption. He called the GENIUS Act the ‚Äúthird most important piece of bank regulation‚Äù in US history.For the uninitiated, the GENIUS Act passed in Congress, with the US president also approving the bill in July. The legislation ushered in stablecoin regulatory clarity, and van Eck believes it also changes things for crypto firms.The VanEck CEO stated that tech-focused firms can now compete with banks in the payment industry, marking the first time in America‚Äôs history. Furthermore, he noted that although it may take a while, the bill will revolutionize Wall Street, with significant implications for the crypto industry.Notably, while the bill would stir interest and capital influx into the crypto space, many suggest Bitcoin would not be a core beneficiary of the bill. Industry leaders have tapped Ethereum and XRP to be at the forefront of this drive due to their glaring stablecoin affiliations.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,1,vaneck ceo jan van eck reiterated bullish outlook bitcoin projecting would rival gold near future van eck told bloomberg august bitcoin digital gold sentiment slowly becoming norm global market suggested emerging narrative would see bitcoin compete gold could claim considerable chunk market claim half gold market cap van eckbloomberg host matt miller highlighted unwavering belief vaneck executive bitcoin even crypto winter asked van eck firm believed much bitcoin ceo noted digital version gold valuable asset eck suggested bitcoin would rise status point existence specifically noted btc would claim half gold valuation pushing price per gold current valuation paint bullish picture bitcoin gold trade today market cap trillion btc attains half gold current value would assume valuation trillion culminating price total supply van eck one insisting bitcoin maturing rival gold mexican billionaire ricardo salina pliego projected month back bitcoin would match gold trillion market cap citing future crypto leader becomes reserve asset recent survey also point bitcoin demonetization gold u report show people hold bitcoin gold america marking shift investment preference favor pioneering ceo lauds stablecoin passagemeanwhile bloomberg interview van eck highlighted passage stablecoin bill another development bitcoin crypto industry would drive mass adoption called genius act third important piece bank regulation u uninitiated genius act passed congress u president also approving bill july legislation ushered stablecoin regulatory clarity van eck belief also change thing crypto vaneck ceo stated firm compete bank payment industry marking first time america history furthermore noted although may take bill revolutionize wall street significant implication crypto bill would stir interest capital influx crypto space many suggest bitcoin would core beneficiary bill industry leader tapped ethereum xrp forefront drive due glaring stablecoin affiliation,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.9849,1
2025-08-04 08:50:10,49513843,1754297410,Korean Crypto Trends: Unveiling Crucial K-Community Insights from Last Week,"BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Trends: Unveiling Crucial K-Community Insights from Last Week Understanding the pulse of the cryptocurrency market requires looking beyond global averages. Regional communities often display unique interests and dynamics that offer valuable insights. This is especially true for the South Korean crypto market, known for its active and influential retail investor base. By analyzing the latest data from the K-Community on Bitcoin World, we can gain a clearer picture of the dominant Korean Crypto Trends between July 25 and 31. What are the Latest Korean Crypto Trends in the K-Community? The K-Community, a vibrant hub for South Korean crypto enthusiasts on Bitcoin World, provides a unique lens into local market sentiment. We analyzed two key metrics for the last week of July: the tokens most frequently searched for and those most frequently mentioned . While both metrics indicate interest, ‚Äòsearches‚Äô often reflect curiosity and initial research, whereas ‚Äòmentions‚Äô suggest active discussion and engagement within the community. These distinct patterns help us identify the evolving Korean Crypto Trends . Let us explore the tokens that captured the most attention: Why Did These Tokens Dominate Korean Crypto Trends in Searches? The list of top searched tokens offers a snapshot of what new information or developments the K-Community was actively seeking. The numbers indicate a strong focus on specific assets, often driven by recent news, price movements, or upcoming events. Here is a breakdown of the top 10 searched tokens, revealing significant Korean Crypto Trends : Token Search Count XRP 84,260 ETH 24,520 ENA 23,175 SOL 19,090 ONDO 13,285 DOGE 10,560 SUI 9,560 ADA 8,020 BTC 7,560 SHIB 6,365 XRP‚Äôs overwhelming lead in search volume is notable. This consistent interest often stems from ongoing legal developments or price volatility, keeping the community highly engaged. Ethereum (ETH) and Ethena (ENA) also saw substantial search activity, indicating strong interest in established smart contract platforms and newer DeFi protocols, respectively. Solana (SOL) and Ondo (ONDO) show a growing curiosity around high-performance blockchains and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, reflecting diverse Korean Crypto Trends . The presence of meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) underscores the continued speculative interest within the community. What Tokens Are Driving Conversation in Korean Crypto Trends?

2025-08-04 08:48:10,49514536,1754297290,"SOL has rallied 13,000% in the past 5 years, these 2 tokens could do the same","In the past five years, Solana (SOL) has been on a wild ride, jumping over 13,000% from about $2.26 in mid-2020 to an astonishing $294 peak in January 2025. The journey wasn‚Äôt all smooth; the FTX meltdown forced SOL to drop below $8. Still, the coin bounced back faster than most expected, rocketing up 997% just in 2023. Strong institutional support, growing staking volumes exceeding $1.3 billion, and growing optimism around a potential Solana ETF have kept momentum alive. While SOL now trades at a much higher level, two undervalued tokens currently priced under $4 may be poised for a similar breakout before 2025 wraps up. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Ethena (ENA) are emerging as two serious contenders. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): where meme culture meets real blockchain utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has caught the attention of early investors with a presale that has already raised over $12.79 million. With stage seven completely sold out, the presale has moved into stage eight, where tokens are being offered at $0.0017. This positive momentum shows that more investors are paying attention and the community is getting more support every day. As the main digital token for the Little Pepe ecosystem, $LILPEPE fuels a cutting-edge Layer 2 blockchain designed for tiny transaction fees, instant confirmation, and security that can handle a lot of activity. While other Layer 2 solutions focus strictly on technical scalability, Little Pepe blends humor, culture, and smart utility into a complete experience. The team behind LILPEPE has mapped out an ambitious roadmap that includes listings on two top exchanges after the presale. Discussions and groundwork are also underway for a future listing on the largest exchange globally, signaling that the project‚Äôs visibility and market access could rise sharply after launch. Strong predictions from experts Top crypto analysts are already drawing parallels between LILPEPE‚Äôs early phase and Solana‚Äôs early days. With a total supply of 100 billion tokens and only 26.5% reserved for presale, the token‚Äôs structure allows for exponential potential. According to projections, LILPEPE could rally up to 13,000%, potentially reaching a price point of $0.221 by the end of 2025, mirroring Solana‚Äôs historical climb. One significant advantage LILPEPE has over its meme coin peers is the backing of several anonymous but influential figures in the crypto scene. Meme coins are maturing and LILPEPE is leading that shift Meme coins once relied solely on hype and community. Today, the strongest ones are building actual tech, use cases, and products, and LILPEPE is a prime example of that trend. Its Layer 2 infrastructure is engineered to compete with Ethereum‚Äôs scalability needs while keeping transaction costs extremely low. More than that, LILPEPE is built around speed. Transactions confirm faster than trending tweets, making it appealing not just for fun but also for practical blockchain use. Ethena (ENA): a fast-rising star in DeFi While LILPEPE brings a fresh layer to the meme coin scene, Ethena (ENA) is positioning itself as a dominant force in decentralised finance. Trading at around $0.57, ENA has gained over 43% in the past week, indicating growing investor interest. Much of this comes from the explosive growth of its native USDe stablecoin, which now boasts over $6 billion in circulating supply. Ethena isn‚Äôt slowing down. With $750 million in recent inflows, a high-profile partnership with Anchorage Digital to launch the USDtb stablecoin in the US, and a massive $100 million token agreement with TLGY SPAC, the protocol is setting itself up for long-term expansion. Analysts are buzzing about ENA, with some going so far as to say this crypto could soar like Solana did, possibly reaching $74.10 before the calendar flips to 2026. Conclusion The crypto space rewards early believers, and right now, both LILPEPE and ENA are positioned at inflection points. LILPEPE is tapping into cultural relevance while laying the groundwork for real blockchain performance. ENA is scaling quickly in the DeFi arena with billions already backing its stablecoin initiative.

2025-08-04 08:47:21,49514534,1754297241,Is MUTM the next crypto to explode as XRP price targets $5,"Meanwhile, crypto investors are actively seeking the next big opportunity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling case during its ongoing presale. Phase 6 is progressing rapidly, offering tokens at $0.035. Buying now promises a guaranteed 71% return at the $0.06 launch price. Over $14,000,000 has been secured already. Participants have purchased more than 665 million tokens. Total MUTM holders now exceed 14,800. The token price has already surged 250% from the initial $0.01 offering. This momentum highlights significant crypto investment interest. XRP eyes $4.70 amid regulatory shifts XRP price action is retesting a key support zone between $2.90 and $3.30. Holding this level is essential for bullish continuation targeting $3.65 and potentially $4.70. Failure risks a drop towards $2.00. The SEC‚Äôs Project Crypto initiative aims to modernize financial regulations. It could foster greater institutional confidence in regulated tokens like XRP. Crypto charts show decreasing exchange reserves. A 7.57% drop indicates coins moving into private wallets, suggesting accumulation rather than selling pressure. This trend often precedes upward price movement. However, crypto prices remain volatile. The RSI reading near 47 confirms current seller dominance. Reclaiming $3.30 remains critical for confirming the next crypto rally. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is advancing through Phase 6. Tokens are available now for $0.035 each. This phase is selling out quickly. Afterwards, Phase 7 opens with a 14.3% price increase to $0.04. Early participation guarantees substantial returns. The confirmed listing price is $0.06. This delivers a 71% profit for Phase 6 buyers. Tokenomics supports significant post-launch growth. Conservative crypto predictions estimate MUTM reaching $0.50 within months. More optimistic forecasts target $1.50 by late 2025. This represents massive potential gains exceeding 4,000%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utility drives this potential. Its platform enables decentralized peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. Users enjoy lower fees via Layer-2 integration. Crypto investment in presales often yields the highest rewards. Security and incentives build trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes security and community trust. The project successfully completed its CertiK audit. It achieved an outstanding 95.00 security score. Further, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program. Partnering with CertiK, it offers $50,000 USDT in rewards. Rewards cover four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low severity findings. Additionally, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway is running. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 in tokens. Participation requires a minimum $50 presale investment. The team also introduced a holder dashboard. It features a leaderboard tracking the top 50 holders. These holders earn bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. Such incentives encourage long-term holding. Why MUTM stands out now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a unique value proposition. Its presale structure provides clear, immediate profit potential. The current $0.035 price presents a final low entry point before Phase 7. Crypto prices post-launch rarely revisit presale levels. Analysts monitoring crypto charts see strong accumulation patterns. The project‚Äôs focus on secure, efficient DeFi lending addresses real market needs. Unlike many new crypto coins, it boasts a working model and clear tokenomics. Crypto investment requires identifying projects with solid fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates these qualities through its rapid funding success and robust security measures. Investors seeking substantial growth should evaluate this opportunity before the price increases again. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance today.

This is precisely the promise of Binance Alpha, and it is about to get even more interesting with the upcoming addition of Fireverse (FIR) to its roster. On August 6, Binance Alpha is set to integrate Fireverse (FIR), marking another significant step in its mission to connect users with the next big things in the blockchain space.

This strategic move reinforces Binance Alpha‚Äôs commitment to fostering growth and rewarding early adopters within its vibrant community. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does It Matter? Binance Alpha is a specialized platform nestled within the broader Binance Wallet ecosystem, designed to spotlight early-stage cryptocurrency projects. Think of it as an incubator and launchpad rolled into one, but with a unique focus on direct user engagement and on-chain trading capabilities. Its importance stems from several key aspects: Early Access to Innovation: Binance Alpha provides a crucial gateway for users to discover and potentially invest in nascent projects before they hit mainstream exchanges. This early access can be a significant advantage for those looking for high-growth potential. Curated Selection: The platform does not just list any project. It employs a rigorous selection process, heavily weighing factors like community engagement and alignment with emerging market trends. This vetting process aims to present users with projects that have demonstrated initial traction and relevance. Seamless Integration: One of the most compelling features of Binance Alpha is its direct integration with the Binance Wallet and Exchange. This means users can engage in on-chain trading of these early-stage tokens without the hassle of transferring assets across multiple platforms, simplifying the user experience significantly. Community Rewards: Through mechanisms like Binance Alpha Points and exclusive airdrops, the platform actively rewards its engaged user base, creating a symbiotic relationship between the projects and their early supporters. The Fireverse (FIR) Listing: What‚Äôs the Hype Around Binance Alpha? The upcoming addition of Fireverse (FIR) on August 6 is a prime example of Binance Alpha‚Äôs strategy in action. Fireverse represents a new frontier in the crypto landscape, and its inclusion on Binance Alpha signals its potential and readiness for broader exposure. For eligible users, this listing comes with an exciting incentive: exclusive token airdrops. These airdrops are a way for Fireverse to distribute its tokens to a dedicated community, and for Binance Alpha users to gain a stake in the project simply by participating and holding Binance Alpha Points. Understanding the significance of this listing requires looking at how Binance Alpha operates. The platform identifies tokens based on a blend of robust community engagement and clear emerging market trends. This dual focus ensures that projects brought to Binance Alpha are not just technically sound but also resonate with the broader crypto community and align with the evolving demands of the market. The Fireverse (FIR) listing is a testament to this careful selection process, indicating that it has met the criteria to be presented to Binance Alpha‚Äôs discerning audience. How Can You Benefit from Binance Alpha‚Äôs New Listing? For crypto enthusiasts and investors, the Fireverse (FIR) listing on Binance Alpha presents several compelling benefits. The most direct advantage is the opportunity to claim exclusive token airdrops. These airdrops are often a significant incentive for early participation in new projects, allowing users to acquire tokens at no direct cost, based on their engagement with the Binance Alpha platform. Beyond the airdrops, the core value proposition lies in the ability to engage with Fireverse (FIR) through on-chain trading directly within your existing Binance Wallet and Exchange interface. This streamlined process removes common barriers associated with accessing new tokens, such as navigating complex decentralized exchanges or managing multiple wallets. The convenience offered by Binance Alpha is a major draw for users seeking efficiency and security in their crypto endeavors. Benefit Category Specific Advantage on Binance Alpha Access to Innovation Discover and participate in cutting-edge projects like Fireverse (FIR) at their infancy. Financial Incentives Receive exclusive token airdrops using accumulated Binance Alpha Points. User Experience Seamless on-chain trading integrated directly into Binance Wallet and Exchange. Project Quality Benefit from a selection process focused on strong community and market relevance. Understanding Binance Alpha Points and Airdrop Eligibility To fully capitalize on opportunities like the Fireverse (FIR) airdrop, it is essential to understand the role of Binance Alpha Points. These points are likely accrued through various forms of engagement within the Binance ecosystem, perhaps through active trading, participation in other events, or holding specific assets. While the exact accumulation mechanism might vary or be detailed on the event page, the core idea is that these points serve as a measure of your activity and loyalty within the Binance Alpha community. Eligibility for airdrops is typically tied to holding a certain amount of these points, or meeting specific criteria outlined on the event page for the Fireverse (FIR) listing.

Missing out on these opportunities is easy if you are not proactive, so staying informed is key. What Are the Challenges and Considerations for Binance Alpha Users? While the prospects of early access and exclusive airdrops through Binance Alpha are appealing, it is important to approach these opportunities with a balanced perspective. Early-stage crypto projects, by their very nature, carry higher risks. The potential for high returns often comes with an equally high risk of volatility or even project failure. Users should always conduct their own thorough research (due diligence) into any project listed on Binance Alpha, including Fireverse (FIR), before making any investment decisions. Furthermore, understanding the terms and conditions for airdrops and token claims is crucial. Sometimes there are specific holding periods, staking requirements, or geographical restrictions that might affect eligibility. Being aware of these details ensures a smoother experience and prevents any surprises down the line when engaging with Binance Alpha. Actionable Insights for Engaging with Binance Alpha For those looking to make the most of the Fireverse (FIR) listing and future opportunities on Binance Alpha, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly check the official Binance Alpha announcements, especially on their X (formerly Twitter) account and within the Binance Wallet application. This is where you will find the most up-to-date information regarding new listings, airdrop eligibility, and event pages. Accumulate Binance Alpha Points: Understand how to earn and accumulate Binance Alpha Points. These points are your key to unlocking exclusive benefits, including airdrops for projects like Fireverse (FIR). Perform Due Diligence: Even though Binance Alpha curates projects, always research the underlying technology, team, tokenomics, and community of any project you consider engaging with. Early-stage projects require extra scrutiny. Prepare Your Wallet: Ensure your Binance Wallet is set up correctly and you understand how to navigate the on-chain trading features within the Binance Alpha platform. Engage with the Community: Community engagement is a criterion for project selection on Binance Alpha, and it can also be a valuable resource for users. Participate in discussions, ask questions, and learn from others‚Äô experiences.

2025-08-04 08:45:00,49514533,1754297100,Satoshi Nakamoto statue theft and recovery in Lugano leaves community shocked,"The Bitcoin community was left stunned after a life-sized statue of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, was stolen, vandalised, and dumped in a lake in Lugano, Switzerland. The incident occurred just one year after the statue was unveiled, marking another mysterious chapter in the ongoing legacy of Bitcoin‚Äôs creator. The steel sculpture, created by Satoshigallery, was designed to symbolise anonymity, with a fragmented, fading effect and a hooded figure seated cross-legged. While the statue has been recovered, it is now damaged, and questions remain over who took it, why it was targeted, and whether legal action will follow. Statue stolen and destroyed in Lugano On 3 August 2025, Satoshigallery announced on X that the statue had been stolen from its location in Lugano. Only the two welded feet remained bolted to its base. The team offered a 0.1 BTC bounty for information that could lead to its recovery. Satoshigallery @satoshigallery ¬∑ Follow Where is Satoshi?We are offering 0.1 btc to whoever will help us recovering the Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto that was stolen yesterday in Lugano.You can steal our symbol but you will never be able to steal our souls.Thank you all for the nice messages.We are all in this 12:51 pm ¬∑ 3 Aug 2025 1.6K Reply Copy link Read 190 replies The post read, ‚ÄúWe are offering 0.1 BTC to whoever will help us recover the Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto that was stolen yesterday in Lugano.‚Äù Just hours later, the creators confirmed that the statue had been found in a nearby lake. It was no longer intact, having been broken apart, which suggested deliberate vandalism. While the statue was retrieved, its restoration will require significant work. Reports of drunken vandalism on Swiss National Day The theft may have taken place during the Swiss National Day celebrations on 1 August. X user Gritto claimed he was in the park near the statue that evening and saw a group of intoxicated individuals celebrating near an open-air caf√© close to the installation.

Gritto suggested that the group, possibly seeking mischief, could have dislodged the sculpture, which was attached at only two points. Due to its weight and the security presence in the area, he speculated they may have decided to throw it into the lake rather than attempt to carry it away. Community calls for accountability The incident triggered an outpouring of reactions from the Bitcoin community. Morfeo, a well-known Bitcoiner, described the act as ‚Äúan absolute disgrace‚Äù on X.

2025-08-03 22:40:03,49489478,1754260803,Trump fired BLS chief Erika McEntarfer after weak job numbers without offering solid evidence,"President Trump‚Äôs economic team is now trying to defend his sudden decision to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and they‚Äôre doing it without a clear case or solid numbers. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett was all over TV today trying to explain the firing, but still didn‚Äôt give any actual proof. Speaking on NBC News, Kevin said, ‚ÄúThe revisions are hard evidence.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt show what that evidence was. He only mentioned there had been ‚Äúa bunch of patterns that could make people wonder,‚Äù but never said what those patterns were or why they mattered. Kevin kept referring to changes in recent job reports as the reason Erika had to go, even though he didn‚Äôt say whether anyone at the White House had ever asked her to explain those changes before firing her . Hassett calls job revisions suspicious but skips proof The jobs report that set all of this off came out on Friday. The BLS said nonfarm payrolls grew by 73,000 in July, a little better than the 14,000 added in June, but still below the Dow Jones forecast of 100,000. The real problem wasn‚Äôt just July. The government also cut its earlier estimates for May and June by a total of 258,000 jobs. That meant the job market had been weaker than originally thought. Kevin called those corrections a ‚Äúhistorically important outlier,‚Äù suggesting they were just too strange to ignore. Instead of pointing to anything illegal or improper, Kevin argued that the president ‚Äúwants his own people there.‚Äù He claimed that someone new would make the numbers ‚Äúmore transparent and more reliable.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIf there are big changes and big revisions, we expect more big revisions for the jobs data in September, for example, then we want to know why, we want people to explain it to us.‚Äù But again, he gave no sign that the White House had even asked Erika to explain anything. Kevin also pushed back on the idea that Trump was just punishing someone for reporting bad news. But that‚Äôs exactly what critics say happened. They argue that the president only had a problem with the numbers once they stopped looking good. Erika‚Äôs firing came at a moment when Trump needed better economic headlines, and didn‚Äôt get them. Former officials and lawmakers say the move damages trust The backlash came quickly. William Beach, who was appointed by Trump as a past commissioner at the BLS, said Erika‚Äôs firing was ‚Äútotally groundless.‚Äù He warned that it ‚Äúsets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.‚Äù William went further on CNN, saying, ‚ÄúSuppose that they get a new commissioner, and this person, male or female, are just the best people possible, right? And they do a bad number. Well, everybody‚Äôs going to think, well, it‚Äôs not as bad as it probably really is, because they‚Äôre going to suspect political influence.‚Äù On Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the president was acting like a dictator. ‚ÄúWell, Donald Trump, firing her isn‚Äôt going to relieve the chaos that you created with your ramshackle tariff regime,‚Äù he said during remarks on the Senate floor. Senator Ron Wyden, who leads the Senate Finance Committee for the Democrats, said the firing was ‚Äúthe act of somebody who is soft, weak and afraid to own up to the reality of the damage his chaos is inflicting on our economy.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúBottom line, Trump wants to cook the books.‚Äù While many criticized the decision itself, others started asking whether the government‚Äôs method of collecting job data should change. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said on CBS News that the government still uses surveys that ‚Äúfrankly just aren‚Äôt that effective anymore.‚Äù He said better technology exists now to track employment numbers and suggested the system should be updated. ‚ÄúThey can get this data, I think, other ways, and I think that‚Äôs where the focus ought to be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHow do we get the data and be more resilient and more predictable and more understandable?‚Äù Senator Rand Paul also raised concerns. He said on NBC News, ‚ÄúWe have to look somewhere for objective statistics.‚Äù Then he added, ‚ÄúWhen the people providing the statistics are fired, it makes it much harder to make judgments that, you know, the statistics won‚Äôt be politicized.‚Äù That‚Äôs coming from a Republican senator, not someone known for siding with Trump‚Äôs critics.

With institutional interest rising and a fresh cycle looming, 2025 might reward those who position themselves early in high-potential assets. XRP and Binance Coin are once again in focus‚Äîbut a newer entrant is starting to build serious buzz among early movers. Just like XRP captured attention during its breakout years, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now drawing comparisons thanks to its rapid presale growth and aggressive utility rollout. Early supporters believe it could follow a similar path, especially with analysts projecting a major surge. XRP: Regulatory Tailwinds Could Fuel a Rally XRP has been one of the most closely watched assets in crypto, especially after Ripple‚Äôs almost certain victory over the SEC. The token is gaining momentum on the back of ETF speculation, with many in the space expecting XRP to follow Ethereum and Bitcoin with its own fund listing soon. This development could open the door to mainstream adoption, driving demand from institutional players that have so far remained on the sidelines. A Newcomer With 50x Potential While XRP continues to battle for its place in the regulated crypto space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already gaining traction at record speed. According to experts, its growth curve has even outpaced XRP ‚Äôs early adoption rate. With limited allocations remaining, investors are scrambling to get in before the next price tier hits. Those who secure a position now could see $1,000 grow to $50,000 if projections hold, making it one of the most explosive opportunities in the market. Each stage is filling up faster than the last, as both retail and early institutional buyers race for entry. Binance Coin: Utility Keeps It Relevant Despite facing regulatory pressure in some regions, Binance continues to dominate global trading volumes. Its native token, BNB, remains at the heart of the platform‚Äôs ecosystem‚Äîpowering discounted trading, launchpads, and gas fees on Binance Smart Chain. With the exchange continuing to expand its reach, BNB is likely to benefit from increased transaction volume and long-term user growth, even in a tougher regulatory climate. Recently BNB even hit a new all-time high (ATH) above $850. Conclusion Between XRP‚Äôs ETF-driven potential, Binance Coin‚Äôs unmatched utility, and MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs explosive presale growth, these three tokens represent different tiers of opportunity heading into 2025. For investors hunting the next breakout success, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs current pace and projections stand out as a rare early-stage chance .

2025-08-03 22:29:19,49488591,1754260159,"Trump wants control of rates, but global savings are drying up","Donald Trump‚Äôs number one economic goal has been to see interest rates lower. But the real problem isn‚Äôt Jerome Powell. It‚Äôs the bigger mess sitting underneath the U.S. economy: too much debt, too many deficits, and a shrinking savings pool caused by demographic changes. According to Bloomberg Economics, the ten-year Treasury rate, the one that affects mortgages and business loans, is more likely to stay above 4.5% than drop below it, no matter who runs the Fed. For over thirty years, borrowing costs fell steadily. Washington could spend freely without crashing the system. Home prices soared, stocks surged, and money was cheap. That‚Äôs over. Now the U.S. is looking at a future where interest payments alone cost more than the Pentagon‚Äôs entire budget. Mortgage rates are at 7%, and real estate is choking. But Trump thinks that by replacing Powell, he can ‚Äúfix everything.‚Äù That‚Äôs not how this works. Trump wants control of rates, but global savings are drying up Trump has been pounding the table for a new Fed chair who will cut rates fast. After Fed Governor Adriana Kugler left early, he saw his chance. By putting a loyalist in her seat, he‚Äôs hoping to tilt the central bank toward his agenda. He‚Äôs also been threatening Powell publicly, calling him ‚ÄúTOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID, & TOO POLITICAL.‚Äù Short-term rates may come down in September, especially with the job market showing cracks, but that won‚Äôt matter much if long-term rates keep climbing. Why are they going up? Because the world‚Äôs savings pool is collapsing. The Baby Boomers, who built it up, are retiring and spending their pensions. China isn‚Äôt buying U.S. debt like it used to. Its reserves dropped from $4 trillion to $3.3 trillion since 2014. That‚Äôs a big hole in demand. And Saudi Arabia is moving its money away from Treasuries and into its own mega projects, like the futuristic Neom city. Even oil-rich petrostates are done parking cash in Washington. The U.S. made things worse. In 2022, after freezing $300 billion in Russian assets, the government turned Treasury bonds into weapons. That scared other countries. If the U.S. can grab Russia‚Äôs money, they can do it to anyone. Then there‚Äôs the Fed itself. For decades, presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama respected its independence. That‚Äôs what made investors feel safe, no one wants to put their money into a central bank that looks politically rigged. Decades of low rates were driven by savings surpluses and weak demand From the early 1980s through the 2010s, interest rates kept falling. The reason? There was too much money chasing too few places to put it. Boomers saved for retirement. China and other countries ran big trade surpluses and used the earnings to buy Treasuries. The oil exporters did the same. Tech was cheap, and growth was slow. All this meant a lower ‚Äúnatural rate‚Äù of interest. Bloomberg Economics says the natural rate fell from around 5% in the 1980s to 1.7% in 2012. But that whole setup is gone now. Boomers are leaving the workforce. China is letting its currency float, so it doesn‚Äôt need to buy dollars to keep it down. Saudi Arabia is betting on the future, not financing U.S. debt. The forces that kept rates low are in reverse. Government borrowing is now out of control. U.S. debt is close to 100% of GDP. In 2001, it was just over 30%. Defense spending is rising again. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Europe‚Äôs NATO members agreed to raise their defense budgets to 3.5% of GDP. Bloomberg estimates that will add $2.3 trillion to Europe‚Äôs debt in the next ten years. Since global investors treat French and German bonds as substitutes for U.S. Treasuries, that also pushes U.S. rates higher. AI is another drain. Building data centers, upgrading power grids, and reworking supply chains will take real money. Governments are competing with businesses for capital, and nobody‚Äôs saving like they used to. The natural rate is moving up. Bloomberg Economics now puts it at 2.5% and says it could hit 2.8% by 2030. That would keep ten-year Treasuries between 4.5% and 5%, even in the best case. If things get worse, the rate could spike to 6% or more. That‚Äôs not something Trump can fix with a personnel change.

2025-08-03 22:25:36,49488827,1754259936,Experts Dismisses Fresh China Crypto Ban Talks,"On August 3 2025, several social media posts claimed that China had placed a new ban on crypto trading and mining once again. The rumor quickly spread online, reaching hundreds of thousands of people. However, experts and trusted sources have come forward to confirm that these claims are false. They state that there is no evidence of any new action by the Chinese government. Social Media Sparks Confusion, Crypto Experts Push Back The rumor started when Kalshi, a well-known prediction market platform, posted on its official X account suggesting China had banned crypto again. The post said the alleged ban happened because of worries about money leaving the country. It also mentioned concerns about the environmental damage caused by crypto mining. These posts triggered widespread confusion and speculation online, with many fearing a repeat of past restrictions from the Chinese government. Su Zhu, the co-founder of the now-defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital responded quickly. He said that there is zero evidence to support the claim. He stated that his sources in China had not heard of any new ban on crypto activity. Colin Wu, a trusted Chinese cryptocurrency journalist, also said there is no proof of a new policy. He explained that although China has introduced restrictions in the past, there is nothing new at this time. Wu emphasized that no official documents or statements have been released to confirm the recent rumors. China‚Äôs Long History With Crypto Regulation The idea of China banning Bitcoin (BTC) mining is not new. China started putting rules on digital currencies more than ten years ago. In 2013, the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBoC) told banks and payment companies to stop handling Bitcoin transactions. In 2017, the Chinese government banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and closed down local crypto exchanges. Many of these exchanges had to move their business to other countries. Then in 2021, China took stronger action by launching a country-wide crackdown on crypto mining . This led to a big drop in mining activities, as many miners either shut down or moved to places with less strict rules. Even with all these restrictions, crypto activity has not completely stopped in China. Colin Wu pointed out that individual crypto transactions have never been made illegal. In addition, Bitcoin mining still takes place in certain parts of the country, especially in areas with access to cheap electricity. In fact, China still makes up about 21% of the total global Bitcoin mining hashrate. China‚Äôs Growing Interest in Stablecoins and RWAs Interestingly, Chinese government officials are now paying more attention to stablecoins and real-world assets (RWAs). Some government officials have started to explore how these tools can be used to support financial innovation, improve payment systems, and promote the digital economy. This suggests that while China remains cautious about cryptocurrencies, the country is not completely closing the door on blockchain and digital assets.

2025-08-03 22:20:43,49488590,1754259643,"Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs led blockchain investments among global banks","A new report released by Ripple in partnership with CB Insights and the UK Centre for Blockchain Technologies shows that Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs have been leading the way as some of the most active traditional financial institutions investing in blockchain technology. The report, which studied over 1,800 banks from 2020 to 2024, also highlights a growing shift in how legacy financial institutions are approaching digital assets. Wall Street‚Äôs blockchain bets Between 2020 and 2024, global banks participated in 345 blockchain investments, 33 of which were mega-rounds. The global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) reportedly made 106 investments in blockchain companies. This also includes 14 megaround deals exceeding $100 million between 2020 and 2024. Among the G-SIBs, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs led with 18 investment deals each, followed closely by JPMorgan Chase and Japan‚Äôs Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group with 15 apiece. The majority of these deals were early-stage investments, especially seed and Series A rounds. The report notes that this suggests a willingness by banks to identify and support emerging firms whose solutions align with long-term strategic goals. The most commonly funded use cases were institutional trading and tokenization infrastructure, payments, and digital asset custody. JPMorgan Chase has made headlines in recent years for piloting its own blockchain-based networks, including the Kinexys platform . The bank conducted its first public blockchain transaction using tokenized U.S. Treasuries in partnership with Chainlink and Ondo Finance. Separately, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have each established multiple blockchain partnerships aimed at exploring tokenized assets and improving capital market infrastructure. Other notable examples include Partior, a real-time cross-border payment platform that raised $111 million in a Series B round in 2024, backed by JPMorgan and Standard Chartered. The Luxembourg-based HQLAx also secured investment from five G-SIBs, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Citigroup, for its blockchain-based securities finance solution. TradFi preferred to partner, invest, not buy It was also observed that most G-SIBs preferred to invest in or partner with blockchain companies rather than pursue full acquisitions. Banks‚Äô approach to blockchain has grown from the hesitant post-crypto-winter period. Investment activity declined in 2022 and 2023 following the FTX collapse and subsequent market turmoil. Data indicate that dealmaking rebounded in 2024, with deal value increasing despite a decrease in overall transactions. The report points to increasing regulatory clarity in major markets such as the United States, the European Union, the UAE, and Singapore. The report suggests that the next chapter for banks will involve scaling blockchain solutions beyond institutional pilots. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that tokenized real-world assets could be worth over $18 trillion by 2033. Even as Tier-1 institutions are making huge strides, smaller regional banks are slowly making their mark as well, entering the space through partnerships with fintechs and participation in utility platforms. According to a 2022 U.S. survey cited in the report, 11% of community banks said they planned to launch crypto-asset services. Want your project in front of crypto‚Äôs top minds?

2025-08-03 22:10:11,49487629,1754259011,Apple AI Unveils Transformative Plans for a Personalized Answer Engine,"BitcoinWorld Apple AI Unveils Transformative Plans for a Personalized Answer Engine In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovations redefine how we interact with technology daily, a new development from Apple is set to capture the attention of tech enthusiasts and industry watchers alike. Just as the crypto world thrives on breakthroughs in decentralized technology, the broader tech sphere is abuzz with the potential of Apple AI to reshape our digital experiences. The Cupertino giant, known for its meticulous approach to product development, appears to be on the cusp of launching a groundbreaking new initiative: its very own AI-powered ‚Äòanswer engine.‚Äô This move signifies Apple‚Äôs deep commitment to integrating advanced intelligence into the core of its ecosystem, promising a more intuitive and personalized user experience. What is Apple‚Äôs Vision for an AI Answer Engine ? Reports from Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman indicate that Apple has quietly assembled a specialized team, reportedly named ‚ÄòAnswers, Knowledge, and Information,‚Äô tasked with a monumental goal: to construct a ChatGPT-like application. This isn‚Äôt just another chatbot; it‚Äôs envisioned as a sophisticated AI answer engine designed to respond to user queries by synthesizing information from across the vast expanse of the web. Imagine a system that doesn‚Äôt just provide links, but rather concise, accurate, and contextually relevant answers, much like a knowledgeable assistant. This could be a game-changer for how users access information and interact with their devices. The potential applications of such an engine are vast and varied: Standalone Application: It could exist as a dedicated app, offering a powerful new way to get information. Integrated Search: Its capabilities could be woven directly into existing Apple services, enhancing search functionalities within Safari. Siri Enhancement: Perhaps most significantly, it could revolutionize Siri, transforming the voice assistant from a command interpreter into a truly intelligent conversational partner. This strategic move underscores Apple‚Äôs intent to control more of its core technologies, especially in areas as critical as search and information retrieval. The Evolution of Siri AI : A Smarter Companion? For years, users have anticipated a significant upgrade to Siri, Apple‚Äôs ubiquitous voice assistant. While Siri has seen incremental improvements and even integrated some basic ChatGPT functionalities, a truly personalized, AI-powered overhaul has been repeatedly delayed. The development of this new AI answer engine could be the missing piece of the puzzle, finally delivering on the promise of a more capable and proactive Siri AI . Imagine asking Siri a complex question about current events, historical facts, or even troubleshooting an issue with your device, and receiving an immediate, synthesized answer rather than a list of web results. This deep integration would mean: Contextual Understanding: Siri could better understand the nuances of your questions and your personal preferences. Proactive Assistance: It might anticipate your needs based on your habits and provide information before you even ask. Seamless Interaction: The line between asking a question and getting a direct answer would blur, making interactions feel more natural and efficient. This potential leap in Siri‚Äôs capabilities could significantly enhance the user experience across the entire Apple ecosystem, from iPhones and iPads to Macs and Apple Watches. Reshaping Apple Search and Beyond Apple‚Äôs foray into an ‚Äòanswer engine‚Äô also has profound implications for the future of Apple search . For years, Apple has maintained a lucrative default search deal with Google, which has been a significant revenue stream for both companies. However, recent antitrust defeats faced by Google could force Apple to re-evaluate or alter this long-standing agreement. Developing its own robust answer engine could provide Apple with a powerful alternative, reducing its reliance on Google and strengthening its position in the competitive search market. This strategic shift could lead to: Enhanced Privacy: Apple could implement its stringent privacy standards directly into its search capabilities, a key differentiator for the company. Unique User Experience: An integrated answer engine could offer a search experience tailored specifically for Apple devices, leveraging the company‚Äôs hardware and software synergy. Increased Control: Apple would gain greater control over the information flow within its ecosystem, further solidifying its walled garden approach. This move isn‚Äôt just about building a new feature; it‚Äôs about potentially reshaping the entire landscape of how users discover and interact with information on Apple devices. Apple‚Äôs Strategic Play in Generative AI The development of an AI answer engine firmly places Apple within the burgeoning field of Generative AI . While many companies have rushed to release public-facing generative AI tools, Apple has traditionally taken a more measured and secretive approach. This ‚Äòanswer engine‚Äô suggests that Apple‚Äôs strategy is focused on integrating generative AI capabilities deeply and seamlessly into its core products, rather than just launching a standalone, experimental chatbot. Apple‚Äôs approach to generative AI appears to prioritize: Privacy and Security: Leveraging on-device processing where possible to protect user data. Integration and Utility: Ensuring AI features are genuinely useful and enhance existing workflows within the Apple ecosystem. Quality and Accuracy: Emphasizing reliability and factual correctness in AI-generated responses. By focusing on an ‚Äòanswer engine‚Äô that synthesizes information, Apple is aiming for a highly practical and reliable application of generative AI, distinct from the more experimental and creative uses seen elsewhere. This focus on practical utility could be Apple‚Äôs winning strategy in the fiercely competitive AI race. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the prospect of an Apple-powered AI answer engine is exciting, the journey will undoubtedly present its share of challenges. Developing a system that can accurately and reliably answer questions from the vastness of the internet is a monumental task, requiring significant investment in research, talent, and infrastructure. Gurman‚Äôs report highlights Apple‚Äôs active recruitment for jobs requiring experience in search algorithms and engine development, signaling the scale of this undertaking. Key Challenges: Data Accuracy and Bias: Ensuring the engine provides unbiased and factually correct information. Computational Power: The immense processing power required for real-time information synthesis. User Adoption: Convincing users to shift from established search habits. Competition: Navigating a market with established players like Google and emerging AI leaders. Key Opportunities: Enhanced User Experience: A truly intelligent assistant could significantly improve daily interactions with Apple devices. Ecosystem Lock-in: A superior AI experience could further solidify user loyalty to the Apple ecosystem. New Revenue Streams: Potential for new services or advertising models built around the answer engine. Strategic Independence: Reduced reliance on third-party search providers. Apple‚Äôs history suggests that when it commits to a new technology, it does so with a long-term vision and a focus on seamless user experience. This AI answer engine could be their next big bet, shaping the future of information access. The Dawn of a Smarter Apple Ecosystem Apple‚Äôs reported venture into building its own AI ‚Äòanswer engine‚Äô is more than just another tech project; it‚Äôs a strategic move that could redefine how we interact with information and our devices. By aiming to create a sophisticated system that can synthesize knowledge from across the web, Apple is poised to significantly enhance Siri AI , revolutionize Apple search , and firmly establish its unique position in the Generative AI landscape. This bold step towards a more personalized and intelligent information retrieval system underscores Apple‚Äôs commitment to innovation, promising a future where your devices don‚Äôt just respond to commands but truly understand and anticipate your needs. As the tech world watches, the potential for a truly transformative Apple AI experience looms large, signaling a new era of digital interaction.

2025-08-03 22:03:54,49487389,1754258634,7 Years in Prison for AML Bitcoin Founder and CEO After a Multi-Million-Dollar Fraud,"White-collar crime surrounding cryptocurrencies was rampant in the early days of the industry. Still, the law is continuing to crack down on those who took advantage of the lack of regulation available at the time. What was touted as innovation turned out to be a scheme used to fund a person‚Äôs lavish lifestyle. Justice Served The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in the Northern District of California shared a press release confirming that Rowland Marcus Andrade, CEO and Founder of the now-defunct AML Bitcoin token, was guilty of wire fraud and money laundering. The jury in the trial , which began earlier in March and lasted approximately five weeks, found the defendant responsible for a scheme that defrauded investors of millions in connection with the marketing and sale of the cryptocurrency. According to documents and evidence presented to the court, Andrade misled the public with incorrect statements about AML Bitcoin, its development, use cases, release date, and more. There was also a claim that the Panama Canal Authority almost permitted the asset as payment for ships passing through the Canal, yet nothing like that was discussed. Further proof was displayed in the ruling, which noted that the accused had manipulated people who trusted the project out of approximately $10 million. More than $2 million of the funds from the sale were spent on personal expenses, which included two properties in Texas and two luxury cars. The jury also found that funds were laundered through a series of bank accounts for further private spending. ‚ÄúThe defendant made one false claim after another about a sophisticated cryptocurrency offering to create the illusion of a legitimate business.¬†He exploited numerous investors who put their trust in him, not knowing that their hard-earned money was funding his lavish lifestyle. Today, Andrade learned the price of his greed,‚Äù said United States Attorney Craig H. Missakian.¬†‚ÄúThis case emphasizes my Office‚Äôs ongoing commitment to prosecuting anyone who undermines the integrity of traditional financial or digital asset markets.‚Äù Along with the prison term, Chief Judge Seeborg also sentenced Andrade to three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay a forfeiture equal to the sum of the funds that were obtained from the deceptive sale. A hearing is scheduled for September 16th this year, which will be used to determine the total amount of forfeiture and restitution owed to the victims of the accused. Quick Rundown Of How It Happened The project originally surfaced around 2014, under the NAC Foundation (LLC), which Rowland Andrade owned. An ICO was launched at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, raising over $5 million. The token was touted as groundbreaking at the time, allegedly offering built-in AML/KYC compliance, biometric ID verification, and anti-terrorism features. An SEC and DOJ complaint was logged in 2020, showing that the product did not exist because there was no platform for it. The complaint also found that a previous token, AtenCoin, which was being worked on by Andrade‚Äôs team,¬†had failed. That same year, lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the CEO were indicted , with the former charged with conspiring to mislead investors. He was required to pay $50,000 in disgorgement and interest, having previously promoted the token.

With Bitcoin stabilizing and institutional momentum pushing into altcoins, fresh opportunities are drawing attention‚Äîparticularly in low-cap tokens with high upside potential like Pump.fun and Fartcoin. One project that‚Äôs also rapidly gaining traction among early investors is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising altcoin that has consistently been compared to early-stage SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN thanks to its explosive presale growth and expanding community. Pump.fun (PUMP), currently trading just below $0.0028, has caught the eye of traders looking for a rebound play. After a sharp post-launch drop, the token has entered a consolidation phase, with technical indicators like RSI now hovering near neutral territory. At this price point, even a modest recovery could offer triple-digit gains, while a full-scale return to early highs might bring up to 3,000% upside, according to speculative forecasts. Not far behind in the spotlight is Fartcoin, now priced around $1.37. Despite a 9% weekly decline, the asset maintains strong daily trading volume of over $250 million, suggesting continued interest from whales and retail traders alike. Its price chart shows a volatile yet structurally bullish trend, with RSI indicators around 55, hinting that further upward momentum remains possible. Amid this growing altcoin enthusiasm, many investors are also turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising star that has now been forecast by analysts to potentially deliver returns of up to 3,000% for early participants. Backed by a rapidly growing community and a presale that‚Äôs seen each stage fill faster than the last, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as more than just a meme or a trend. It‚Äôs building a utility-driven ecosystem where smart entry could lead to incredible rewards . Even a modest $500 allocation today could turn into $15,000 if current projections hold. Why These Altcoins Are Heating Up Pump.fun (PUMP) After bottoming out post-launch, Pump.fun is showing early signs of accumulation. Traders are monitoring this closely, especially given the token‚Äôs ultra-low entry price , which historically has attracted momentum plays in bull markets. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) With a market cap exceeding $1.3 billion, Fartcoin is no longer just a joke coin . Whale activity, strong daily volume, and a gradually rising trend suggest that traders are treating it as a serious candidate for speculative upside‚Äîespecially with meme coin narratives back in fashion. Final Thoughts As Bitcoin cools down, attention is rapidly shifting to the altcoin space. Tokens like Pump.fun and Fartcoin are already gaining traction, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum off-chain with its presale. The window for early movers is narrowing fast, and the right allocation now could lead to massive gain s by the time the next crypto wave fully hits.

2025-08-03 22:00:00,3731378,1754258400,HBAR price prediction 2025-2031: Hedera Hashgraph soon to retest its ATH?,"Key takeaways : In 2025, HBAR is expected to trade between $0.2629 and $0.2975, with an average trading price of $0.2723. In 2028, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.9634, with an average price of $0.8191. By 2031, HBAR could trade between $2.48 and $2.84, with an average price of $2.56 HBAR price prediction ‚Äì Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is a cryptocurrency that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021, alongside other altcoins. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR‚Äôs price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing to a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we may see a bullish scenario unfold sooner, perhaps a retest of its all-time high. Overview Cryptocurrency Hedera Hashgraph Ticker HBAR Current Price $0.2391 Market Cap $10.13B Trading Volume (24Hr) $432.15M Circulating Supply 50 Billion HBAR All-time High $0.5701 on Sep 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.01001 on Jan 03, 2020 24-hour High $0.2413 24-hour Low $0.2262 HBAR price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.55% 50-day SMA $‚ÄØ0.200503 200-day SMA $‚ÄØ0.150378 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green Days 17/30 (40%) Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) price analysis HBAR is showing early signs of recovery from its recent decline but remains below key resistance levels The daily chart suggests possible consolidation between 22 and 26 cents unless strong buying pressure returns Short-term momentum indicators are turning slightly bullish but lack confirmation from volume or strength metrics HBAR price analysis 1-day chart HBARUSD¬†chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart, Hedera (HBAR) is showing strong bullish momentum after rebounding from the mid-Bollinger Band near $0.24. The price is currently approaching the upper Bollinger Band at $0.31, signaling potential resistance ahead. The RSI is at 72.99, placing the asset in overbought territory, which may limit further immediate upside. The MACD remains positive, reflecting sustained bullish momentum, but a slowdown in histogram growth suggests buyers may be losing steam. If HBAR breaks above $0.31 with volume, it could retest previous highs. Otherwise, a pullback toward $0.27 or the mid-band support near $0.24 remains a likely scenario. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBARUSD¬†chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Hedera (HBAR) is attempting a short-term rebound after dipping near the lower Bollinger Band, now testing the middle band resistance at $0.244. The MACD has flipped marginally bullish, with a slight crossover suggesting momentum could shift upward if volume supports the move. However, the Balance of Power remains negative at -0.90, indicating buyers have not fully regained control. If HBAR maintains above $0.241 and pushes past $0.245, a climb toward $0.26 is plausible. Failing to break resistance may lead to consolidation or a retest of $0.224 support, marking a critical range to watch in the near term.

Based on the combined analysis of the 1-day and 4-hour charts for Hedera (HBAR), the asset is attempting a technical recovery after a notable decline from its July highs near $0.31. On the 1-day chart, price action shows a bounce from the lower Bollinger Band, but resistance at the 20-day SMA ($0.258) could limit upside. RSI recovery from oversold levels signals a potential continuation, though still below mid-channel strength. The 4-hour chart reinforces this rebound attempt, with a minor MACD crossover and weak buyer strength per Balance of Power. Consolidation between $0.22 and $0.26 remains likely unless volume surges notably. Is HBAR a good investment? Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.2975. How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth $1.98. Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching¬†$20¬†would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly¬†unlikely. For context, with HBAR‚Äôs¬†current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to¬†$660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $1.60 and $1.66, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes. Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good, long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.2055 by 2025 and $1.30 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Recent news/opinion on HBAR Hedera ranks second in core developer activity with 126 active contributors, indicating strong community interest and potential for innovation and growth. While this supports ecosystem expansion through tools like CLI and AI Studio, true success also depends on user adoption, transaction volume, and addressing concerns like centralization and ecosystem maturity.

2025-08-03 21:51:06,49488064,1754257866,Don‚Äôt Miss the Dip: These Coins Could Make Millionaires in the Next Bull Run,"Market dips often present rare chances to invest in high-potential assets before the next major rally. As sentiment shifts and accumulation quietly builds, select cryptocurrencies like Hyperliquid, Toncoin, and NEAR Protocol are showing early signs of strength. This article highlights three coins that could deliver outsized returns in the next bull run‚Äîpossibly turning today's dip into tomorrow‚Äôs fortune. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Fluctuates, Eyeing Potential Breakout Source: tradingview Hyperliquid (HYPE) is currently seeing prices between $40.59 and $47.22. It has taken a dip recently, falling 12% over the past week and around 5% in a month. However, it has surged by over 51% in the last six months. This mixed picture has investors curious. If it breaks past the resistance of around $50, there's potential for HYPE to aim for nearly $57, marking a 20% rise. However, investors are also aware of support near $37, which might stabilize declines. The mood is watchful as the cryptocurrency hovers between its 10-day and 100-day moving averages. Toncoin Shows Promise with Recent Gains and Potential for More Source: tradingview Toncoin (TON) has been on a solid rise, with its price recently climbing over 11% in just a week and boosting by nearly 29% in the past month. Sitting in a range around $3.06 to $3.64, TON is edging closer to its nearest resistance level of $3.91. Should it surpass this, it might aim for the next resistance of $4.49, marking a potential increase of about 24% from its current high end. With the coin's RSI at almost 58, it's showing some strength. However, it's still below the 10-day moving average, suggesting room to grow. If this momentum continues, Toncoin may reach exciting new heights. NEAR Protocol Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Recent Price Movement Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol's price is hovering between just under $3. Recent trading trends show a 6% rise over the past month, recovering from a sharp decline. This uptrend brings the coin near its first resistance level of $3.40. Stronger gains could push it towards $3.91, presenting a potential increase of over 20% from its current standpoint. However, it's important to note the mixed signals: NEAR experienced a 36% dip over the last half year, indicating past volatility. Current indicators like the RSI suggest it's neither overbought nor oversold, implying balanced momentum. If support holds at $2.37, the coin may attract more investors, potentially boosting its growth prospects. Conclusion While the market remains uncertain, Hyperliquid, Toncoin, and NEAR Protocol each show technical setups and momentum shifts that could signal larger moves ahead. With solid support levels and growth potential on the horizon, these coins may offer savvy investors a strategic entry point. For those looking to capitalize on the next wave, the current dip might be the opportunity to act before the crowd catches on. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-03 21:49:17,49487207,1754257757,"While Everyone‚Äôs Selling, Smart Investors Are Grabbing These 5 Future Moonshots","While panic drives many to sell, sharp-eyed investors are quietly accumulating assets with long-term potential. Market dips often expose undervalued cryptocurrencies, and a handful of tokens are now flashing early signs of future strength. This report uncovers five promising projects‚ÄîWorldcoin, Algorand, Hedera, FET, and Injective‚Äîthat smart money is watching closely as the next potential moonshots. Worldcoin Hovers in Volatile Waters, Eyeing Potential Growth Source: tradingview Worldcoin (WLD) is currently priced between one dollar and a bit over one dollar and thirty cents. It's facing a resistance at one dollar and fifty-six cents, with support near ninety cents. Over the past week, its value dipped by nearly 17%, but it rose slightly by just over 2% this past month. Moving forward, if WLD can break through its nearby resistance, it could climb towards one dollar and eighty-nine cents, a potential increase of roughly 35% from the bottom of its range. With an RSI close to the middle at 55, Worldcoin shows some energy for growth. Still, it must first stabilize and push past its immediate hurdles. Algorand Eyes Recovery Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Algorand (ALGO) is currently trading between $0.25 and $0.32. It recently saw a monthly gain of a little over 30%, hinting at potential for growth. However, a decline of nearly 13% in the past week shows volatility. The next target for bulls is the $0.34 resistance level, with hopes of reaching around $0.41 if momentum continues. On the downside, support is seen at $0.22 and $0.16. The RSI is above 60, suggesting strength, while the Stochastic is high, indicating potential overbought conditions. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages both sit at $0.24, indicating a stable trend. If ALGO rallies to achieve these levels, expect rises of up to 32% from present pricing. Hedera (HBAR) Eyes Gains Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Hedera‚Äôs price ranges between a quarter dollar to just over a quarter and a half dollar, showing recent promise after a challenging period. This month, Hedera surged by over fifty percent, reflecting renewed investor interest. However, the coin remains below its nearest resistance at thirty-five cents. If it breaks this barrier, it could climb to the lower forties, an increase of about twenty-five percent. Recently above its 100-day average, Hedera is showing positive momentum. Although the past week had a dip, short-term indicators suggest potential further gains. If support holds at twenty cents, Hedera could continue its upward trend, marking it as a coin to watch. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Shows Potential Amid Recent Dip Source: tradingview Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is currently priced between $0.68 and $0.86. Recently, its value dipped by almost 14% over the past week and about 13% in a month, with a larger decline over six months. Despite this, its position above crucial support at $0.60 suggests potential stability. If it bounces back, FET could aim for resistance at $0.96. Breaking this could push it toward the next target at $1.15, marking a considerable price increase of about one-third from current levels. With the RSI around average and other indicators stable, FET has room for growth if market conditions improve. Injective (INJ) Shows Signs of Promise After Recent Volatility Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency Injective (INJ) is currently trading between $13.62 and $16.49. It has seen its value shift recently, with a 9.52% increase over the past month despite a decline of about 15.72% over the last week. The coin's performance suggests potential for further gains. With a relative strength index of around 61, there's room for upward movement. If momentum builds, INJ might challenge the $17.54 and potentially the $20.41 resistance levels, offering investors a potential rise of approximately 23% to 35% from its current range. However, it is crucial for the price to maintain above the $11.81 support to keep this bullish outlook intact. Conclusion Despite current volatility, Worldcoin, Algorand, Hedera, FET, and Injective all exhibit key technical and momentum signals that suggest possible strong rebounds. With clear resistance targets and solid support zones, each coin presents a distinct setup for growth as market sentiment stabilizes. For forward-thinking investors, these assets may offer a rare chance to enter ahead of the crowd before the next breakout wave begins.

2025-08-03 21:30:08,49486449,1754256608,Elon Musk reveals that senior Meta engineers have moved to xAI without needing ‚Äúinsane‚Äù compensation,"Elon Musk has revealed that a number of senior engineers at Meta have transitioned to his AI venture, xAI, despite modest initial compensation packages. Musk predicted that in the long run, xAI‚Äôs valuation may exceed Meta‚Äôs, and highlighted the firm‚Äôs tendency to award substantial raises to its top performers. He also pointed out that these engineers joined without premium entry-level packages, placing their faith in xAI‚Äôs potential growth. Many strong Meta engineers have and are joining xAI and without the need for insane initial comp (still great, but not unsustainably high). Also, xAI has vastly more market cap growth potential than Meta. And we are hyper merit-based: do something great and your comp can shift‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 3, 2025 Musk‚Äôs comment came in response to an X post indicating that Meta appr oached u pwards of 100 OpenAI employees and successfully onboarded at least ten in a ‚Äúdesperate move.‚Äù Recently, Zuckerberg had also disclosed that Shengjia Zhao , the mind behind ChatGPT‚Äôs development, has taken on the role of chief scientist at Meta Superintelligence Labs. Reportedly, other candidates turned down Meta‚Äôs offers because they saw OpenAI as closer to true AGI, pref erre d the speed and flexibility of a smaller team, and didn‚Äôt want to wo rk on ad-driven projects. The user also noted in another post that ‚Äúno AI lab matches xAI speed with a small team in just two years‚Äù. In its first year, xAI rolled out ten new tools: two chatbots (Grok 2 and Grok Mini), an image generator called Aurora, the Grok Button for quick analysis, a mobile app, Grok 3 with DeepSearch, an uncensored voice mode, Grok 4, a companions feature, and the ‚ÄúImagine‚Äù tool. Musk‚Äôs claims emerge amid intensifying tech talent war xAI‚Äôs swift deployment has impressed industry observers amid an escalating contest among major AI organizations, including OpenAI, Google, and Meta, to attract premier researchers. Meta has broadened the AI arm and earmarked $14 billion in funding for Scale AI. In June, Meta launched Superintelligence Labs as a research hub designed to convene top experts in the domain. Sam Altman, OpenAI‚Äôs chief executive, has claimed that Meta dangled compensation packages reaching $100 million to lure his team, a claim Meta disputes. According to WIRED, more than ten such recruitment offers were extended to OpenAI staff. In one case, a seasoned researcher was even tapped for a chief scientist position but opted not to accept. Moreover, any shares or stock options Meta promised to those new hires would become 100% theirs after one year on the job. However, Anthropic‚Äôs employees remained unswayed by Meta‚Äôs lavish incentives, according to co-founder Benjamin Mann. He stressed that Anthropic employees prioritize the organization‚Äôs mission over compensation. Cryptopolitan recently reported that Meta and Microsoft collectively saw their market capitalization climb by approximately $550 billion within a single day. This beats Costco‚Äôs entire valuation by $140 billion and outpaces Netflix‚Äôs market worth by about $50 billion. In early trades in Europe on Thursday, Meta‚Äôs shares surged 12.2% in Frankfurt and Microsoft‚Äôs advanced 9% following a modest pullback late Wednesday. That momentum helped push S&P 500 futures up 1% and Nasdaq futures by 1.3% ahead of the U.S. open. Meta surpassed second-quarter estimates, delivering earnings of $7.14 per share versus a $5.89 consensus, and generating $47.52 billion in revenue against the $44.83 billion forecast. For Q3, the company anticipates revenue in the $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion range, exceeding the consensus view of $46.2 billion. It also raised its full-year expense guidance to a range of $114 billion‚Äì$118 billion, implying a year-over-year cost uptick of roughly 20%‚Äì24%.

Last week alone, Ethereum ETFs attracted over $2.2 billion in inflows‚Äîmarking one of the largest institutional movements into any cryptocurrency product this year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs witnessed minimal action, leading many market participants to question if Ethereum‚Äôs moment in the sun is truly here. But the crypto narrative is always shifting, and savvy investors holding positions in major altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and now Sui (SUI) are already looking beyond ETH. According to analysts, there‚Äôs one particular altcoin quietly gaining momentum with potential returns of up to 12,000% : MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum‚Äôs ETF Surge: Why Institutions Are Dumping BTC Ethereum ETFs have surged amid growing institutional adoption, marking an unprecedented shift away from Bitcoin-focused funds. The figures speak volumes: Ethereum ETFs saw a record $2.2 billion inflow in one week. Digital asset funds have achieved 14 consecutive weeks of inflows. Ethereum-based institutional products now total over $220 billion in assets under management. Ethereum‚Äôs appeal lies in its active and evolving DeFi ecosystem, combined with clearer regulatory frameworks, making ETH an attractive bet for traditional financial institutions. But while ETH has managed to eclipse Bitcoin in recent weeks, market experts suggest even more aggressive ROI opportunities lie beyond Ethereum, in rapidly emerging altcoins. XRP, Solana, and Sui Investors Eyeing Bigger Gains Despite XRP‚Äôs recent bullish performance‚Äî trading around $3.14 ‚Äîand Solana hovering at $179.90 , both face inherent limitations: XRP continues to grapple with regulatory uncertainty despite bullish ETF rumors. Solana (SOL) has institutional backing but faces competition from newer Layer-1 chains like Aptos and Sui . Sui, while gaining attention as a next-generation chain, still struggles with early-stage volatility and user traction. As institutional focus intensifies on Ethereum ETFs, crypto investors traditionally loyal to XRP, SOL, and SUI are now actively seeking projects that can offer higher exponential returns in shorter periods. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Quietly Attracting Whales Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE ‚Äîa new altcoin capturing investor attention with bold predictions of returns reaching up to 12,000% . With its unique blend of political symbolism and robust DeFi mechanics, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly carved out a niche as a high-potential investment. Here‚Äôs why MAGACOIN FINANCE is on analysts‚Äô watchlists: Deflationary Economics: MAGACOIN FINANCE employs a scarcity-driven token model, with regular burns reducing circulating supply and increasing token value. Institutional Audits: Already HashEx-audited with a CertiK audit underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides investor confidence amid a turbulent market environment. Staking Utility Live from Day One: Unlike competitors such as Bitcoin Hyper, MAGACOIN FINANCE has launched with immediate DeFi functionalities including staking, governance voting, and community reward programs. While Ethereum ETF growth underscores institutional appetite, investors looking for explosive returns are increasingly pivoting to newer, riskier assets with massive upside‚Äîand MAGACOIN FINANCE is firmly positioned at the front of this new wave. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Be the Next Big Crypto Winner? Crypto market veterans know that timing is everything. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs explosive early-stage growth, combined with institutional-grade auditing and unique DeFi integrations, positions it as one of 2025‚Äôs potential breakout stories . Early analysts have openly compared MAGACOIN‚Äôs current trajectory to historic meme-coin successes like Shiba Inu and early-stage Pepecoin‚Äîboth famously delivering life-changing gains for their early backers. As Ethereum ETFs dominate headlines, behind-the-scenes whale movements indicate a clear shift toward altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, hinting that the smart money is quietly accumulating positions before wider market discovery. Bottom Line: Why Investors Should Act Now Ethereum ETFs‚Äô record-breaking inflows show that institutional money is hungry for crypto exposure, yet the largest ROI opportunities remain in high-upside altcoins. With analysts predicting MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver returns upwards of 12,000% , it‚Äôs little wonder why seasoned investors from XRP, Solana, and Sui communities are pivoting to capture this potentially explosive upside. The crypto market‚Äôs next significant opportunity may not be Ethereum or Bitcoin‚Äîbut an altcoin like MAGACOIN FINANCE , already on the radar of savvy investors and poised for a monumental breakout.

The correction, which briefly dragged prices below $3,400, has sparked debate: Is this a pause before a breakout, or the start of a more profound decline? A fascinating counter-narrative has emerged: a whale bought $300 million of ETH , indicating they believe this dip is temporary. Someone is playing big on $ETH . Instead of bloodbath whale loading their bags with only ETH. In the last 3 days, he purchased $300M ETH from Galaxy Digital OTC. What a confidence, zero hesitation. Now, its current worth $264M is currently down 8.7%. While you are selling,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/iHUTRAuNKH ‚Äî Henry (@LordOfAlts) August 3, 2025 On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows the massive purchase happened as prices were dropping ‚Äì a ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù strategy from a high-conviction entity. This, as the broader market is reeling from macro pressures: a strong US dollar and weak non-farm payroll data, which triggered risk-off sentiment. ETH price drop : -13% from July highs Whale purchase : $300 million in ETH Market cap : $422B Trading volume : $28.8B (past 24h) This divergence between price action and whale behavior suggests a potential reversal. While many traders are exiting on fear, the aggressive accumulation indicates a medium to long-term recovery outlook. It also comes as Ethereum is an institutional asset tied to upcoming ETFs and on-chain upgrades. Ethereum (ETH) Price Tests Critical Zones Ethereum price prediction is turning bullish as ETH is trying to recover from $3,374 ‚Äì its lowest since early July. Price is testing the 0.236 Fib at $3,491, a level that was both support and resistance before. A clean break above this could lead to $3,564 (38.2% Fib) and $3,623 (50%), with ultimate recovery at $3,681 (61.8%), which is also the 50-period SMA at $3,711. #Ethereum Price Prediction ETH bounces from $3,374 support but faces major resistance at $3,564 (Fib 38.2%). RSI still weak at 39.5. Watch: Break above $3,681 = bullish continuation Rejection = drop to $3,267 likely Whale bought $300M ETH ‚Äì confidence or trap? #ETH #Crypto pic.twitter.com/S7h4jBgF32 ‚Äî Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 3, 2025 Momentum is still weak. The 4-hour RSI is at 39, just below the 50 neutral zone. Without bullish divergence or volume confirmation, the price may stall at resistance. A reversal candle (bullish engulfing) above $3,564 would add to the recovery. But rejection at $3,491 or $3,564 would be bearish and could drag ETH back to $3,374 or even $3,267. Ethereum Trade Outlook: Watch the $3,564 Breakout If ETH breaks above $3,564 with volume and a bullish candlestick, traders can target $3,681 and $3,765. This is Fibonacci and historical resistance, a high probability setup.

2025-08-03 21:05:04,49484982,1754255104,"XRP Has Formed Golden Entry, Analyst Says This Is Your Final Chance to Get Rich","Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has ignited fresh excitement across the XRP community by identifying what he calls a ‚ÄúGolden Entry‚Äù on the monthly chart. This is a rare technical pattern that historically preceded explosive price action. According to him, this could be investors‚Äô final opportunity to accumulate XRP before a major breakout, echoing the asset‚Äôs legendary 2017 bull run. Echoes of 2017: History May Be Repeating In a striking side-by-side comparison, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlights XRP‚Äôs current monthly chart structure and compares it to the 2017 cycle. Back then, XRP formed a symmetrical triangle before breaking out and skyrocketing from below $0.01 to an all-time high of $3.84 in just a few months. #XRP HAS FORMED THE GOLDEN ENTRY! This is your final chance to get rich. pic.twitter.com/w6xJgKH4TL ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 That triangle pattern‚Äîmarked by narrowing price action followed by a powerful breakout‚Äîwas what the analyst termed the ‚ÄúGolden Entry.‚Äù Now, in 2025, XRP appears to be replicating that exact formation. After a strong rally that began in late 2024, XRP entered a months-long consolidation phase just below $3.50. As of report time, the asset has broken out of that triangle pattern, confirming what the analyst sees as another ‚ÄúGolden Entry‚Äù moment, potentially signaling the start of a major upward move. XRP Price Update: Breakout Confirmed XRP is currently trading at $2.90. The breakout from the consolidation triangle has now been confirmed on the monthly time frame, with the August candle showing strong bullish momentum. Crucially, XRP has reclaimed the $2.95‚Äì$3.00 zone, a key resistance range that has repeatedly stalled previous rallies. With this barrier now broken , traders are eyeing a push toward $3.50, followed by a possible surge to $5.00 and beyond. If the current pattern continues as it did in 2017, analysts believe a move to $10 or higher is within reach. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Fundamentals Support the Rally XRP‚Äôs bullish momentum isn‚Äôt just technical‚Äîit‚Äôs also being driven by expanding ecosystem developments and rising institutional interest. Ripple‚Äôs launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD, in December 2024 has brought new liquidity and real-world utility to the XRP Ledger. Additionally, the expected deployment of FXRP, which enables trustless bridging between XRP and other networks, such as Flare, is generating further excitement. While some concerns were raised after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold $200 million worth of XRP in July, market sentiment remains firmly bullish. Trading volumes have increased, and technical indicators are flashing green across multiple time frames. Golden Moment or Missed Opportunity? Skeptics may brush off the ‚ÄúGolden Entry‚Äù as overhyped, but the technical signals and historical parallels are difficult to ignore. XRP has broken out of a textbook triangle formation on the monthly chart, just as it did before its explosive rally in 2017. If this setup repeats, the upside potential could be substantial. According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, this may very well be the last chance for investors to enter before XRP embarks on its next major leg up. With the chart, the fundamentals, and the sentiment all aligning, XRP‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Entry‚Äù could define this cycle‚Äôs biggest breakout.

Altcoin interest is surging again, and one project in particular‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äîis beginning to draw serious attention from traders looking for stronger momentum plays. XRP Fails to Break Key Levels XRP has held steady around the $3 mark for weeks, showing resilience but little upside action. Even as large wallets continue to accumulate and network usage grows, the lack of a breakout is leaving short-term traders frustrated. While long-term prospects remain intact, there‚Äôs growing demand for tokens with faster growth potential and more immediate returns. Early Investors Are Targeting the Next Big Opportunity That appetite for action has triggered a rush toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new player that recently saw its presale round close faster than expected. Now entering its next funding wave, the project is generating FOMO across crypto channels. Analysts are pointing to a potential 5,000% return , noting that even a small investment could grow into a fortune. The hype isn‚Äôt just talk‚Äîcommunity numbers are growing, and early backers are comparing this moment to the breakout phases of past meme coin legends. Traders Grow Restless as XRP Lacks Catalysts Back on the XRP front, hopes are still pinned on regulatory clarity and a potential ETF listing‚Äîbut timelines are uncertain. Some are holding, but others are clearly moving funds into faster-developing projects. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP isn‚Äôt delivering the action many traders are chasing right now, and attention is drifting. Conclusion XRP may still see its moment, but right now, capital is flowing to altcoins with stronger short-term upside. With MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs rapid presale and 5,000% ROI prediction, it‚Äôs clear which way momentum is shifting.

2025-08-03 21:00:00,1703334,1754254800,"Ethereum price prediction 2025-2031: Will ETH reach $5,000 soon?","Key takeaways Ethereum price prediction suggests an average market price of $4,688 by the end of 2025. In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $14,529 and $17,204, with an average expected price of $14,949 In 2031, ETH could trade between $45,184 and $51,567 with an average price of $46,747. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors‚Äô recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? ‚ÄúIs ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs get into the details by exploring Ethereum‚Äôs price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $3,465 Market cap $418.47B Trading volume (24-hour) $28.43B Circulating supply 120.71M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $3,515.43 24-hour low $3,357.94 ET price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 14.41% 50-day SMA $2,991.37 200-day SMA $2,458 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green days 20/30 (67%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis ETH daily chart signals fading momentum below $3,600 with RSI cooling from overbought territory 4-hour chart shows sideways consolidation around $3,460 amid weak MACD and bearish balance of power Bulls need to break $3,600 to resume the rally or risk retesting lower bands near $3,300 Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum Holds $3,260 Support as Bulls Eye Recovery Toward $3,627 Based on the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) on Aug 3, the price has recently pulled back from its peak near $4,200 and is now consolidating around the $3,460 mark. The RSI has cooled to 52.49, indicating a transition out of overbought conditions, while the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, hinting at weakening momentum. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The Bollinger Bands are wide but starting to contract slightly, suggesting reduced volatility. Support is currently near $3,260, while resistance lies around $3,627. If buyers fail to regain strength above the midline, Ethereum may continue to range sideways or revisit support. Reversal signals remain inconclusive without volume confirmation. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: ‚ÄúEthereum Struggles to Reclaim Mid-Band Support as $3,460 Holds the Line Based on the 4-hour Ethereum chart, the recent price action reflects a continuation of bearish correction from the $3,880 region, with current consolidation near $3,460. The Bollinger Bands show price stabilizing near the lower band, suggesting oversold conditions might be easing. ETHUSD chart by TradingView However, the MACD remains deeply in negative territory at -3.28 with no bullish crossover in sight, and the Balance of Power reading of -0.44 indicates sellers still control momentum. Unless ETH closes above the 20-SMA near $3,567 with volume confirmation, further downside toward $3,307 support is likely. Caution is warranted until a stronger bullish reversal pattern is confirmed. ETH technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2,952.26 BUY SMA 5 3,356.45 BUY SMA 10 3,567.51 SELL SMA 21 3,540.58 SELL SMA 50 2,991.37 BUY SMA 100 2,693.71 BUY SMA 200 2,458.00 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3,370.71 BUY EMA 5 3,131.23 BUY EMA 10 2,762.85 BUY EMA 21 2,414.35 BUY EMA 50 2,288.06 BUY EMA 100 2,455.35 BUY EMA 200 2,665.39 BUY What to expect from ETH price analysis next? Based on the 1-day and 4-hour ETH/USD charts, Ethereum shows signs of short-term stabilization but remains technically vulnerable. On the daily chart, ETH has pulled back from the $4,000 region and is hovering near the 20-day SMA at $3,627.03, with the RSI falling from overbought levels around 72.56 to a more neutral 52.49. This suggests a cooling-off phase with potential for either a bounce or further downside. On the 4-hour chart, price is consolidating around $3,460, beneath the middle Bollinger Band. Momentum indicators remain bearish, implying that bulls must reclaim $3,600 to avoid deeper corrections toward $3,300. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,019 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $36,694 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum‚Äôs price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,133 and a high of $11,875. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,866. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $51,567 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum Ethereum Celebrates 10 Years as DeFi‚Äôs Foundation Ethereum marks its 10th anniversary, transforming from a visionary whitepaper into the backbone of decentralized finance. Since its launch, Ethereum has enabled billions in value to move seamlessly across a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. The transition to proof-of-stake following The Merge has established staking as a core network feature, attracting over one million validators who now secure the network. Institutions increasingly choose platforms like Figment to stake, citing non-custodial options, SOC 2 Type II compliance, robust MEV policies, and audit-ready reporting.

2025-08-03 20:52:52,49485149,1754254372,A Bitcoin whale opened a $45M 40x long that liquidates at $105K,"A whale just placed a massive Bitcoin bet, $45 million worth, with 40x leverage, according to data from Coinglass. The trade was opened with a liquidation line at $105,000, and if Bitcoin hits $125,000, it‚Äôll trigger $5.6 billion in short liquidations, most of which are clustered near $121,000. At press time, Bitcoin is trading just above $114,000, which puts the whale‚Äôs stop-loss level only a few thousand dollars away. But while some short-term traders are sweating it out, long-term holders aren‚Äôt budging. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for Long-Term Holders (LTH) remains above 0.5, meaning they‚Äôre still sitting comfortably in profit. These holders are showing no signs of panic, unlike Short-Term Holders (STH), who are now stuck deciding whether to sell at a loss or hold on in underwater positions. STH wallets are lingering close to breakeven and are contributing to sell pressure during every minor price rally, per data from CryptoQuant. Selloff on Binance reveals where longs got wiped On August 1, Binance‚Äôs cumulative net taker volume dropped sharply, falling past -$1 billion and crashing to -$1.5 billion, levels not seen since July 25. That metric tracks the difference between aggressive buys and sells, and a deep negative print means the sellers were in full control. The decline came right after a liquidation that wiped out long positions around $114,000, with a heatmap on Coinglass showing a cluster of liquidations hitting that level, likely from traders who bought into the previous rebound and got caught when the trend reversed. Also, around the same time, funding rates across Binance, Bitmex, and Deribit all dipped into negative territory, meaning more people started opening shorts, expecting Bitcoin to fall further. These zones are often referred to as ‚Äúcold zones‚Äù in trading circles, times when traders become heavily tilted toward one side of the book, in this case, shorts. The combination of falling funding and increased short exposure laid the groundwork for massive open interest buildup on the downside. Retail traders appear to be repeating the same behavior seen in all previous cycles, which is buying near tops and selling near bottoms.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly what happened last week, when panic-selling followed long liquidations, then flipped instantly into short builds. It‚Äôs the same reflexive loop again; Get long late, get liquidated, get short late, and possibly get squeezed. Demand-side data shows continued strength Despite the noise, demand indicators haven‚Äôt turned bearish. A chart measuring apparent demand, the difference between newly issued Bitcoin and coins untouched for over a year, shows that the market has absorbed about 160,000 BTC in the past 30 days. That figure means more buying is happening than new supply hitting the market. Wallets labeled as accumulator addresses, those that only buy and never sell, added close to 50,000 BTC during the same timeframe. These addresses are seen as signals of high conviction buying. There‚Äôs no selling history behind them, and they‚Äôve consistently been stacking during the latest price chop. Off-chain activity shows OTC desks sitting on less Bitcoin than they‚Äôve held in years, per CryptoQuant. Four years ago this time, these desks held roughly 550,000 BTC, but are now at about 145,000 BTC, a 74% tumble. That means big players aren‚Äôt offloading. Instead, it looks like the inventory is getting bought and not replaced. There‚Äôs no current sign of demand collapse. Metrics from accumulators, OTC desks, and dormant supply all suggest that long-term positioning is intact. Volatility has affected short-term activity, but longer-term metrics remain stable. The short-side imbalance is growing, and with that $5.6 billion sitting exposed above $121K, the market is already watching to see if this whale‚Äôs position becomes the final nudge that sets it all off.

2025-08-03 20:30:47,49485061,1754253047,XRP to $10? This Altcoin Could Deliver 34x Returns,"XRP is back in the spotlight after an explosive rally in July pushed the token above $3.10 for the first time in years. With renewed optimism surrounding the long-awaited ETF decision and legal clarity slowly emerging, investors are now wondering whether $10 is finally on the horizon. Some analysts believe it is. Major investment newsletters have started calling XRP one of the few legacy altcoins with enough liquidity and momentum to make a serious move in this cycle. While Bitcoin takes a breather, XRP is quietly building strength with growing whale activity and steady volume near $7 billion a day. This comes as MAGACOIN FINANCE begins attracting attention from savvy investors looking to diversify before the next big breakout . XRP‚Äôs Path to $10 The token‚Äôs latest breakout saw a vertical rise from under $2.00 to over $3.60 before settling near the $3.13 range. This performance has reignited talk of XRP reaching double digits‚Äîa feat that would require a 3x from current levels. With ETF speculation heating up and the token now a confirmed participant in the upcoming Midnight airdrop, the momentum could build quickly. Why This New Contender Is Gaining Traction While XRP commands headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building something big in the background. With 34x reward potential flagged by multiple top-tier newsletters, the token is becoming a standout in early-stage investing circles. What‚Äôs fueling the buzz is not just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs performance. The most recent presale round closed in record time, and analysts are pointing to the fastest growth curve since the early days of SHIBA INU. For investors who missed previous cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the comeback opportunity . Will XRP Sustain Its Momentum? Despite the strong rally, XRP still faces resistance around $3.60 and psychological pressure near the $5 mark. However, the technical structure remains bullish, and several macro catalysts‚Äîincluding regulatory announcements and institutional inflows‚Äîcould tilt sentiment sharply. If the current pace holds, a $10 target by late Q4 2025 isn‚Äôt out of the question. Conclusion XRP has reentered the race with strong tailwinds, and investor optimism is rising. But for those chasing bigger upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its 34x return potential and explosive presale data. With early access windows closing fast, smart money is moving quickly to get in before the next leg up.

2025-08-03 20:30:24,49484295,1754253024,The Second Circuit has set SBF's appeal hearing for November 2025,"Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs ( SBF) appeal hearing has been scheduled to begin in the week of November 3, 2025, exactly two years after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy following the widely chronicled collapse of his FTX exchange in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs appeal of his conviction and 25-year sentence is set to be heard by the Second Circuit in the week of November 3, 2025. SBF‚Äôs appeal hearing is scheduled for November 2025 The proposed calendaring order was originally filed on July 30, 2025, which put the case on the docket two years after his conviction. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) handed SBF a 25-year sentence on March 28, 2024, after a conviction on November 3, 2023, on seven counts, including wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs case has been moving through the Second Circuit since the spring of 2024, with multiple filings from both sides arguing over the fairness of SBF‚Äôs trial, sufficiency of the evidence, and alleged procedural errors. What‚Äôs next for SBF? The exact arguments from SBF‚Äôs legal team‚Äôs formal notice of appeal to the Second Circuit, seeking to overturn his conviction, remain sealed or partially redacted in public filings. However, previous court proceedings suggest SBF is most likely challenging the court‚Äôs handling of key evidence, jury instructions, and restrictions on his testimony. The play here would be to get a new trial or a reversal of the conviction. The U.S. government filed its reply on December 13, 2024, where government prosecutors maintained that SBF received a fair trial, and the verdict was backed by strong proof of criminal misconduct. Like the original trial, the crypto sector and beyond will be tuned in to the progress of Bankman-Fried‚Äôs appeal . Notably, there is a perception that regulators ramped up the scrutiny on the crypto industry after the dramatic collapse of FTX . If the conviction is confirmed by the Second Circuit, SBF‚Äôs remaining legal options will be limited to seeking an en banc rehearing, which is a rare review by all the judges of the Second Circuit. He could also file a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court reverses or erases any portion of the verdict, the case could be remanded for a new trial or resentencing.

2025-08-03 20:30:22,49484080,1754253022,Crypto Funding Hits $1.6B in a Week as Treasury Bets Grow,"The crypto funding in the market is growing fast again. Between July 28 and August 2, crypto companies raised over $1.6 billion. Big investors are now backing projects that connect crypto to real-world uses like payments and finance. This shows growing trust in crypto‚Äôs practical future. There is also a growing interest in regulations and financial transparency. Companies are raising capital to prepare for new laws, especially around stablecoins and treasury management. MARA Leads with $850 Million in Crypto Funding MARA, the largest public Bitcoin mining company, made headlines by securing an $850 million private offering through zero-coupon convertible notes due in 2032. The offering targets qualified institutional buyers. It also includes a potential $150 million upsell, possibly bringing the total close to $1 billion. The crypto miner plans to use most of the money to buy more Bitcoin, pay off some debt, and protect its stock from big price swings. The deal is tied to the company‚Äôs stock price, showing that investors believe in the company‚Äôs strong market position. Furthermore, Mill City Ventures became the first publicly listed company to launch a crypto treasury strategy backed by the Sui Foundation. Through a private placement, Mill City invested $450 million to buy 76.3 million SUI tokens at $3.64 each. The company saw support from Karatage and the Sui Foundation. Mill City plans to keep adding more tokens through OTC deals and public market purchases. FG Nexus Backs Ethereum with $200M Raise FG Nexus, formerly Fundamental Global, raised $200 million to buy Ethereum (ETH) and invest in staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). The move marks Ethereum‚Äôs 10th anniversary and a shift to using ETH as its main treasury asset. This initiative was supported by big names such as Galaxy Digital, Kraken, Hivemind Capital, and Digital Currency Group. This strategy puts FG Nexus among the leading corporations pushing Ethereum adoption. In parallel, the ETH Strategy campaign added another 12,342 ETH worth $46.5 million, primarily through private sales. Most of the ETH will go toward staking and liquidity, with the rest supporting audits, growth, and community incentives. Web3 Projects Attract Millions as Stablecoin Momentum Grows Some Web3 and infrastructure-focused projects also secured funding during this period. RD Technologies raised $40 million to build stablecoin infrastructure just as Hong Kong‚Äôs stablecoin licensing framework came into effect. Billions Network raised $30 million from Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and Polygon. Backed by ZA Bank, the company plans to launch regulated digital products like HKDR and a cross-border wallet. Tether-backed Stable raised $28 million to build a blockchain for stablecoin payments, led by Bitfinex and Hack VC. The gasless blockchain supports USDT and follows the new GENIUS Act.

2025-08-03 20:06:09,49482570,1754251569,"Experienced Analyst Reveals Options, Bullish and Bearish Price Predictions for Bitcoin Price in the New Week","In his latest report, cryptocurrency analyst Axel Adler evaluated Bitcoin and the general crypto market within the framework of macroeconomic developments, price momentum, and the options market. According to Adler, external risks such as weak employment data and rising trade tariffs have reduced risk appetite in markets, leading to sharp corrections in Bitcoin. According to Adler's analysis, weak nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data released in the US, the Fed's fifth consecutive interest rate cut, and a wave of new tariffs have driven investors to safe havens. Stocks have sold off during this period, and Bitcoin's price has fallen from $119,000 to $112,000. Bitcoin's 30-day momentum has fallen from 8.6% to 3%. Despite increasing short-term market pressure, Adler notes that major companies, particularly Coinbase, Tether, and institutional strategy funds, have made approximately 30,000 BTC worth of new purchases. Coin outflows from exchanges also continue. Related News: Bitcoin Miners' Profit Margin Reaches Highest Level in Recent Times - What Does This Mean? According to Adler, the $119,000 level remains a key resistance level, while the $112,000 level is currently a critical support area. A break above this level could lead to the price testing $110,000, while $108,000 acts as psychological support. A decline in 30-day momentum to 3% indicates a significant weakening of the uptrend, according to Adler. A rebound above 8‚Äì10% could indicate buyers are re-entering the market. The Maximum Loss price, which is the level at which the highest loss will occur in the Bitcoin options market, is at $118,000 for the expiration date of August 8, 2025. The sharp decline in option selling volume at levels above $110,000 suggests that bearish positions are weakening, according to Adler. Adler also outlined bull and bear scenarios for the BTC price: Bullish scenario: If the $118,000 level holds and call volume continues to increase, the price could test the $122,500‚Äì$125,000 range. A break above this level could bring targets of $130,000 and above to the forefront. Bearish scenario: If the $118,000 level is broken and the put option volume in the $112,500‚Äì$115,000 range exceeds $1 million, the price may pull back to the $110,000‚Äì$112,500 range. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-03 20:05:33,49482541,1754251533,Analyst: Should We Ignore This XRP Sell Signal?,"Crypto analyst StephisCrypto has shared a weekly chart of XRP paired with the U.S. dollar on Bitstamp, highlighting what the analyst describes as a potentially significant sell signal. The chart features candlestick data extending into mid-2025 and shows that XRP recently climbed to a high above the $3.50 level before a small retracement. Red arrows are marked at prior points of price peaks, suggesting a repeated pattern where these signals coincided with market pullbacks. The chart also shows that the recent upswing in XRP followed a period of sideways price consolidation, culminating in a large green candlestick that propelled the token past the $3 mark. The pattern appears consistent with previous movements where price rallies were accompanied by elevated stochastic relative strength index readings. Should we ignore this #XRP sell signal? pic.twitter.com/qBXPbBGWfo ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 Stochastic RSI Readings and Interpretation In the lower panel of the chart, the stochastic RSI is plotted with two lines colored blue and orange, displaying current readings of approximately 77.65 and 85.77. Historically, each red arrow was placed when the stochastic RSI reached or exceeded similar levels, which often preceded corrective price activity. The analyst appears to be emphasizing that the current stochastic RSI is again in the higher range. While the stochastic RSI can be an indicator of overbought conditions, it is not definitive evidence of an imminent reversal without considering broader market context and price structure. The attached commentary suggests that the analyst is urging caution among traders who rely on technical signals for short-term positioning.

Another user, MJS, contributed a perspective suggesting that different investors interpret these signals based on their objectives. MJS noted that if individuals are involved with XRP due to expectations about its role in the future financial system, they should maintain a longer time horizon and not react impulsively to individual technical readings. The statement closed with a remark implying that not all market participants will endure volatility successfully. Considerations for Traders and Investors The chart and commentary illustrate an ongoing debate between technical trading disciplines and broader investment theses. While the stochastic RSI is elevated, suggesting a possible overextension in short-term momentum, other considerations such as overall market structure, adoption trends, and sentiment toward XRP‚Äôs long-term utility may influence decisions. The historical examples marked on the chart show that similar stochastic RSI conditions coincided with price pullbacks. However, whether this pattern will repeat depends on factors including liquidity conditions, macroeconomic trends, and developments specific to XRP‚Äôs ecosystem. As with any trading decision, participants are encouraged to consider multiple timeframes and to remain aware of the inherent risks in digital asset markets.

2025-08-03 20:00:56,49484988,1754251256,Ethereum vs. Solana: Which Altcoin Will Be the Bull Market Leader?,"Ethereum and Solana are once again drawing headlines as the altcoin market shows renewed signs of life. With Ethereum approaching the $4,000 mark and Solana hovering near $180, investors are comparing the two for leadership in the next bullish leg. But while these giants battle for dominance, another project‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äîis quietly drawing early-stage attention for those looking beyond the obvious names. Ethereum Shows Strength Into Q3 Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $3,801, up 1.48% in the past 24 hours and 5.42% over the last week. The token‚Äôs momentum is being fueled by surging institutional interest, with over $5.4 billion in ETF inflows recorded this month. On-chain data also shows aggressive whale accumulation, with large holders scooping up more than $4 billion in ETH. The rally has been steady, supported by solid fundamentals and a favorable technical setup. RSI indicators remain balanced, showing room for growth without signaling overbought conditions. As a result, Ethereum is once again being positioned as the altcoin market‚Äôs pace-setter. Away from the headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own breakout story. The project‚Äôs current presale round has eclipsed all previous cycles in demand , with retail and strategic buyers moving in rapidly. Investors are already eyeing amazing returns if the growth curve mirrors early-stage altcoin cycles like SHIBA or PEPE. As major exchange listings loom, access is tightening fast, making early entry more urgent than ever. Solana Faces Pullback After Strong Rally Solana (SOL), now trading at $179.42, is down nearly 6% on the week, even as its long-term chart remains bullish. The RSI reading is slipping below 37, often a sign of oversold conditions, though no strong rebound has formed yet. SOL had previously pushed above $200 but has since retreated as traders rotated profits elsewhere. Despite its drop, Solana maintains a sizable market cap of $96.5 billion, keeping it firmly in the large-cap category. Still, in the current cycle, Solana is showing less resilience compared to Ethereum‚Äôs sustained strength. Conclusion In summary, Ethereum appears to be regaining its leadership role thanks to strong ETF inflows and growing institutional demand. Solana, while still relevant, is showing signs of cooling in the short term. But for those seeking explosive potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about presale opportunities this year ‚Äîmirroring the kind of early interest that preceded some of crypto‚Äôs biggest success stories .

2025-08-03 20:00:26,49484078,1754251226,Spartans Changes the Game with Big Bonuses and a Huge Game List While Betano Focuses on Sponsorships,"The sports betting world is growing fast, not just from big-name deals or large events. The real shift is happening where users play. While Betano has become the new title sponsor of Portugal‚Äôs Superta√ßa and works to increase its name across football, Spartans is standing out in another way. It offers 300% welcome bonuses, 5,963 games, and crypto payouts that are processed right away. This platform gives value now, not later. Today‚Äôs users want quick access, fair terms, and smooth payouts. They are starting to care less about big names and more about real use. Betano struggles to match that. Traditional sportsbooks like Betano focus on growing through ads and football deals, while Spartans is showing what a modern betting site can really do. There are no KYC forms, no delays with banks, and no lack of games that offer fast fun and easy access. Betano Partners with FPF to Sponsor Portuguese Super Cup The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) has announced that Betano will sponsor the Superta√ßa Candido de Oliveira in 2024. Betano is an online betting brand owned by Kaizen Gaming. The agreement is already active. It makes Betano the title sponsor of the Super Cup game between Sporting CP and SL Benfica, which takes place on July 31 at Estadio Algarve. Joao Medeiros Cardoso, head of marketing at FPF, said this deal will raise the Superta√ßa‚Äôs profile and help bring Portuguese football to a wider global audience. The deal also includes matchday events and ways for fans to engage more. Ricardo Branquinho, Betano‚Äôs country manager in Portugal, said the company wants to grow its sports support and get closer to fans. Betano is also known for backing FC Bayern, the 2025 Copa Am√©rica Femenina, and the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. These deals show Betano‚Äôs push to become a top name in global football. Esports Toto: South Korea‚Äôs Plan to Regulate Esports Gambling South Korea may soon launch ‚ÄúEsports Toto,‚Äù a betting system backed by the government. Proposed by KeSPA, this system would allow legal betting on top games like League of Legends and Dota 2. The idea is to build on the country‚Äôs Sports Toto model. If approved, it could bring money into leagues, improve esports structures, and add to the National Sports Promotion Fund. The idea is gaining support, especially from South Korea‚Äôs Democratic Party, which supports tech. Supporters believe it could fight illegal gambling, bring more trust to the market, and give pro esports teams new backing. But not everyone agrees. Some worry about young people getting hooked on gambling too early. Studies show students already face risks from illegal betting, which now controls 80% of gambling in the country. Critics say that if rules are too weak, Esports Toto could make gambling too normal. Still, if this plan works, South Korea could become a leader in legal esports betting. It might shape how other countries in Asia treat esports and gambling in the future. How Spartans Puts Players First with Fast Access and Big Bonuses While sites like Betano focus on branding and sports sponsorships, Spartans.com takes a direct path to the user. It uses only crypto payments, removing delays from banks and skipping slow checks. Winnings are sent right away, and players can withdraw smoothly at any time. Spartans stands out with over 5,963 games, including slots, blackjack, crash games, roulette, baccarat, and live shows. It also offers a full sportsbook that covers EPL, NBA, UFC, and more. With over 43 providers, the platform has options for all types of players and game styles. Spartans focuses on clear terms, fast features, and full access. There are no delays in getting started, no confusing bonus terms, and no limits based on your location. It‚Äôs made to work well for crypto users who want easy use and fair play, not just another big brand. Players can log in on any device, anytime. The site is built for mobile use, and no app is required. Every part of the experience is made to be quick, smooth, and ready for action across all crypto methods. Final Say Betano is gaining attention with more sports deals, but its actual site use is not moving fast enough for crypto users. Spartans puts the focus on the things that matter: more games, stronger bonuses, and fast money out. This is not just about which brand is louder. It‚Äôs about which one gives more value. Spartans does that with rewards that don‚Äôt take time or steps. Whether you are spinning slots, betting live, or playing table games with crypto, everything works right away and without guesswork. So while Betano builds its name through ads and deals, Spartans gives players something more real. In the fast world of crypto betting, that‚Äôs what matters. That‚Äôs why more serious players are moving to Spartans now.

2025-08-03 20:00:18,49484076,1754251218,"2025‚Äôs Top Crypto Performers: BlockDAG‚Äôs BTC Auction Gains, Pi Hits 60M, ENA Moves 17.6%","Strong performance often shows under pressure, and three crypto names are now in focus. Pi Network is moving fast, reaching 60 million users, and Ethena is climbing after a key price breakout. Both are moving forward, but BlockDAG stands out for its structured progress. Its 10 BTC Auction is now live, rewarding presale participants ahead of the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With $360 million raised and 24.6 billion BDAG sold, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focused on results, not just attention. For those watching the top crypto performers of 2025, this approach offers a clear edge. BlockDAG Activates Final Auction Phase Before August 11 Launch BlockDAG has entered the final part of its presale with strong momentum. To raise engagement, it has launched a 10 BTC Auction worth more than $1.1 million. This final move is set to drive activity right before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This is not just a regular giveaway. It works by linking every BDAG purchase before the deadline to the auction. The more one buys, the higher the possible share of the Bitcoin pool. This event is the final stage in a larger plan. So far, BlockDAG has raised $360 million, sold 24.6 billion BDAG, and recorded a 2,660% ROI since Batch 1. Batch 29 is now priced at $0.0276, but a short-term $0.0016 price window remains open, giving new users more potential for gain. BlockDAG‚Äôs method is simple and focused: reward those who act, grow user support, and finish strong. With the auction ending soon and winners to be revealed on launch day, the timeline is clear and urgent. Those following the top crypto performers of 2025 will see that BlockDAG is focused on real outcomes. This campaign is designed to turn users into part of the project‚Äôs future. With the auction active, the final week offers a clear reward path for those ready to join. Pi Network Progress: User Growth Drives New Phase The current Pi Network outlook shows rising momentum as the platform moves past 60 million registered users. This signals strong traction across its ecosystem. Its Open Network is now live, and over 12 million users have completed the migration from mining to active use on the mainnet. This marks a major shift. Users are now moving from collecting to real participation. This rise in verified users is leading to improved ecosystem use. Pi Network outlook now highlights expanding real-world utility through early apps, growing merchant interest, and wallet features. The launch of Pi App Studio also adds to the pace, inviting developers to build inside a decentralized space backed by a wide user base. Even though price clarity is still unfolding, more listings and better liquidity are expected to help define value. What remains clear is the consistent growth in participation and the steady release of supply. Pi Network is turning community support into real forward movement. Ethena ENA Moves Up: Technical Breakout Builds Strength Ethena ENA technical outlook has shifted after a sharp breakout. In the past week, ENA rose about 17.6 percent after breaking above the $0.485 level, which has now turned into solid support. This move brought new buying interest and higher trading activity. New on-chain data shows more than 1.07 billion ENA taken off exchanges. This suggests lower short-term selling pressure and stronger holding behavior. ENA is now above both its 50-day and 200-day EMAs, pointing to steady upward movement. Forecasts now place the next price zone between $0.60 and $0.70. If momentum keeps building, a run toward $1.00 or more is possible. Still, some short-term risks remain, as RSI and MACD indicators show strong momentum that may lead to a pullback before further gains. BlockDAG Marks a Clear Path in the 2025 Crypto Landscape As Pi Network expands user activity and Ethena moves forward with new technical strength, BlockDAG is following a clear and structured plan. Its 10 BTC Auction links buying activity to reward, forming a presale model focused on timing, planning, and results. BlockDAG has raised over $360 million and is preparing for its GLOBAL LAUNCH on August 11. This effort shows more than potential. It shows real movement. For those reviewing the top crypto performers of 2025, BlockDAG‚Äôs progress shows how connecting structure with delivery can set a project apart. The current campaign shows what can happen when every action is designed to create outcome. Among the top crypto performers , BlockDAG is showing how strategy, structure, and timing come together to move forward with purpose.

2025-08-03 20:00:00,289092,1754251200,Sonic price prediction 2025-2031: Will S reach $1 soon?,"Key takeaways : The average Sonic price prediction for 2025 is $0.5664 Holders can anticipate a maximum price of $1.77 in 2028. By 2031, Sonic (S) might touch $5.58. Fantom Integrates to Sonic (S) Chain On March 25, 2024, Fantom CEO Michael Kong announced the launch of the Sonic mainnet following the completion of its testnet. The proposal included a decentralized bridge to Ethereum for improved security, streamlined staking options, and the introduction of liquid staking. Michael Kong Unveils Sonic‚Äôs Launch and Beyond TL;DR Sonic will be used to create a new best-in-class shared (decentralized) sequencer for L1 and L2 chains, capable of 180M daily transactions at sub-second finality, and serve as the foundation to relaunch Fantom as an entirely‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/AFEYxddC09 ‚Äî Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) March 25, 2024 Fantom fully rebranded as Sonic on January 16, 2025, to reposition itself within the market. As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem‚Äôs utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform‚Äôs adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market‚Äôs growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM‚Äôs all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let‚Äôs dive into Sonic‚Äôs price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.2997 Market Cap $863.39M Trading Volume (24-hour) $98.34M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.3042 24-h Low $0.2808 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 9% 50-Day SMA $‚ÄØ0.340139 14-Day RSI 34.94 Green Days 15/30 (50%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) 200-Day SMA ‚Äì Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : SONIC is showing a mild recovery but still stuck below major resistance near $0.34 Indicators across both timeframes suggest weak momentum and indecision Key support lies at $0.27 while resistance remains at $0.31 and $0.34 Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day SONIC/USD chart on Aug 3, the asset is attempting a mild rebound, rising approximately 3.20% to $0.3000 after touching lower Bollinger Band support near $0.2753. However, the broader trend remains bearish, with the price significantly below the 20-day SMA at $0.3439 and the upper band resistance at $0.4124. The RSI remains weak at 39.38, indicating that SONIC is still in oversold territory and lacks strong momentum. The MACD remains negative, showing no crossover, which implies that downward pressure could persist. Unless it breaks decisively above the $0.343 resistance, SONIC risks revisiting its lower support zone around $0.27 or lower. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour SONIC/USD chart, the price has rebounded slightly to $0.30, but it remains beneath the midline of the Bollinger Bands ($0.3088), suggesting limited bullish strength. The MACD is flat with both the signal line and MACD line converging near zero, which reflects market indecision and absence of strong trend momentum. The Balance of Power indicates neutral pressure, meaning buyers and sellers are evenly matched. Until the price breaks above $0.31 convincingly, upside remains capped. The lower Bollinger Band at $0.2778 acts as key support, while resistance lies near $0.3398. Consolidation or minor pullback remains likely short-term. Sonic technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.366244 SELL SMA 5 $0.368736 SELL SMA 10 $0.35256 SELL SMA 21 $0.36674 SELL SMA 50 $0.341324 SELL SMA 100 $0.41696 SELL SMA 200 No Data No Data Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.343261 SELL EMA 5 $0.353779 SELL EMA 10 $0.3858 SELL EMA 21 $0.431521 SELL EMA 50 $0.490106 SELL EMA 100 $0.535243 SELL EMA 200 No Data No Data What can you expect from the Sonic (prev.FTM) price analysis next? Based on SONIC‚Äôs 1-day and 4-hour charts, the token is showing signs of tentative recovery but remains in a broader bearish structure. On the daily chart, SONIC recently bounced from the lower Bollinger Band and now hovers near $0.30, though it still faces overhead pressure near the $0.3439 mid-band. RSI on the 1-day is weak at 39, indicating limited bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart shows some stabilization but no strong breakout signals, with MACD flat and Balance of Power neutral. Until $0.31‚Äì$0.34 is broken with volume, SONIC likely continues in a sideways-to-down trend with resistance overhead and support at $0.27. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5664 price by 2025 and $3.63 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.15 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.63. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.58. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.15 and $3.63, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

2025-08-03 20:00:00,49483362,1754251200,"Higher Bitcoin ETF Options Limits May Cut Volatility, but Boost Spot Demand: NYDIG","Bitcoin‚Äôs trademark volatility may be entering a new phase thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency's decision to raise position limits on options for most bitcoin ETFs could help smooth price swings by encouraging strategies like covered call selling, which caps the upside in exchange for steady income, according to NYDIG Research. That increase in position limits for options trading on IBIT came as the regulator approved in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs. By letting traders hold ten times more contracts than before, NYDIG wrote, the SEC has opened the door to more aggressive and sustained options activity. Covered call strategies, in particular, work best at scale. They‚Äôre designed to earn yield from existing holdings by selling upside exposure, which can naturally suppress price movement if done across large portfolios. Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility has already been on the decline, with Deribit‚Äôs BTC Volatility Index ( DVOL ) showing a steady decline from around 90 to 38 over the past four years. Still, it stands out compared to bonds, stocks, and other traditional assets. That makes it a tempting target for investors trying to collect income from market swings, effectively harvesting volatility, but also risky for institutions that require stable exposures. ‚ÄúAs volatility declines, the asset becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. This dynamic could reinforce spot demand,‚Äù NYDIG‚Äôs analysts wrote. Ray Dalio, one of the earliest champions of such risk-parity strategies, recently suggested a 15% allocation to gold and crypto amid rising debt levels. ‚ÄúThe feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand,‚Äù the firm concluded.

2025-08-03 19:55:49,49482071,1754250949,Canadian Teen Convicted in $37M Bitcoin Heist and 2020 X Hacking Spree,"A Canadian teen has been sentenced for a $37 million Bitcoin (BTC) heist and the hacking of several X accounts. This follows on-chain sleuth ZachXBT‚Äôs calls for stricter penalties against SIM swapping and social engineering fraudsters. Suspect‚Äôs Sentence ZachXBT revealed via a July 29 X post that Cameron Redman had been convicted and ordered to pay compensation following his involvement in a $37 million Bitcoin theft and a related X hacking case that the investigator had uncovered. Court documents show that Redman has been sentenced to 12 months and 1 day, followed by a three-year supervised release term for each count, with all sentences to be served concurrently. He has also been ordered to pay a $400 special assessment, $248,257.07 in restitution, and a $60,000 fine. On February 22, 2020, the Canadian teenager used a SIM swap attack to take control of crypto investor Josh Jones‚Äôs mobile number, allowing him to bypass two-factor authentication and access his wallets. He then stole 1,547 BTC and 60,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), valued at around $37 million at the time. Following the theft, Redman began laundering the stolen assets through hundreds of small transactions. These tokens were eventually funneled through centralized exchanges in an attempt to hide the trail. The perpetrator was later linked to phishing scams and the hacking of several NFT profiles on X. According to ZachXBT, in June 2022, Redman offered access to an internal X panel for sale on the platform SWAPD. This was then sold for 250 ETH and led to the compromise of over 10 accounts and the theft of millions through phishing scams. The detective added that the Canadian youth initially used fake identity documents on SWAPD before submitting his real information, withdrew the sale proceeds through Tornado Cash, and then deposited the funds into a Stake account. On-chain data linked the wallet he used to the compromised X accounts. The investigation identified victims, including Beeple, DeeKay, Zeneca, Nouns DAO, and JRNY Club. Calls for Tougher Rules The suspect was formally charged on November 17, 2021, by Hamilton Police in Ontario. Authorities recovered $5.4 million in crypto, but the remaining $31.5 million is still missing. At the time of his arrest, Redman was still legally underage, which meant his name remained sealed and his photo was not released. ZachXBT has previously highlighted how this kind of secrecy is part of the problem, saying the convicted criminal‚Äôs identity should have been revealed earlier on to prevent further unlawful conduct. Such cases are on the rise, with research from Keepnet Labs showing a 1,055% increase in SIM swap incidents in the UK in 2024. Elliptic‚Äôs State of Crypto Scams 2025 analysis also highlighted phishing as a key method used by cybercriminals like North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus, with attackers increasingly automating campaigns using AI tools. Meanwhile, ZachXBT previously reported that between November and December last year, a single hacker breached over 15 X accounts, stealing more than $500,000.

2025-08-03 19:48:57,49481811,1754250537,XRP flashes major ‚Äòsell signal‚Äô as temporary price buffer is identified,"Although XRP has gained some ground in the last 24 hours in a bid to breach the $3 resistance, the asset‚Äôs technical structure is painting a concerning picture for the short term. According to analysis by Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential recently flashed a sell signal on the three-day chart, prompting a notable price pullback below the $3 mark, he noted in an X post on August 3. The warning signal came after XRP reached highs above $3.60, with the bearish cue suggesting that the latest rally could be running out of steam. The 9-count TD Sequential signal, known for predicting trend exhaustion, appeared just as XRP approached a resistance zone between $3.60 and $4. Since then, prices have been sliding steadily, and the token is now approaching a key short-term support level. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, on-chain data shows that past accumulation behavior points to $2.80 as a temporary buffer for XRP, but real support begins below $2.48. To this end, Martinez identified $2.40 as the critical zone to watch. If XRP continues to bleed lower, this level could act as a final line of defense for bulls to regroup. A failure to hold above $2.40 may open the door for deeper losses, possibly revisiting the $2.00 region. XRP URPD price chart.

Many altcoins continue to trade indecisively, with ETH dropping further away from $3,500 and SOL close to breaking below $160. BTC Bounces Off $112K Bitcoin‚Äôs business week began on a relatively familiar note as it jumped toward $120,000 after it erased the losses charted at the end of the previous one. However, as it happened during the last few attempts to take down that resistance, the bears quickly reemerged and didn‚Äôt allow BTC to challenge its all-time high, set in mid-July. Within the next few days, the cryptocurrency traded sideways between $117,000 and $119,000 before it dipped slightly on Wednesday evening to $116,000 after the US Fed refused to lower the key interest rates. Although it bounced back to its upper boundary on Thursday morning, the worst was yet to come. Amid political turmoil and global economic uncertainty, BTC‚Äôs price went into a correction mode and dropped to $115,000 on Thursday and Friday and below $112,000 on Saturday evening, which became a three-week low. It reacted well to the last price dump and has added over $1,500 since then. Its market cap remains stable on a daily scale at $2.260 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins is above 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XRP Joins the Pack Ripple‚Äôs native token took yesterday‚Äôs correction relatively well , as it remained sideways around the crucial $3 support, while most other alts were deep in the red. However, XRP has joined the adverse party, by losing that coveted support level and dumping roughly 4% to under $2.9 as of press time. Ethereum has extended its gap to $3,500 after another minor daily decline, while SOL and DOGE have dropped by around 1%. The rest of the larger-cap alts are with insignificant losses and gains. Pi Network‚Äôs token has bounced off its latest ATL registered yesterday and now sits around 4-5% above it at $0.36. The total crypto market cap stands at essentially the same spot as yesterday at $3.750 trillion, having dropped by almost $250 billion since Thursday morning. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The prominent altcoin now trades around $2.81 with no indication of a potential pause in selling momentum. While this crisis persists, popular X analyst with the username Egrag Crypto has helped identify the currently crucial support and resistance levels for the market bulls. Related Reading: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own‚ÄîAnalyst Hold $2.65 Or Risk Collapse, Break $3.12 And Set For Rally In an X post on August 2, Egrag Crypto shares an interesting technical insight on the XRP market currently undergoing an intense correction wave. According to the renowned analyst, macro analysis indicates the altcoin retains a bullish structure; however, the present price correction can only be terminated via two pathways. Firstly, micro price analysis suggests that XRP must achieve a daily price close above $3.12 to signal a market bottom entry. In doing so, the cryptocurrency reclaims a pivotal resistance level, paving the way for a potential rise to higher levels such as $3.60. On the other hand, the immediate major support level lies around $2.65. Egrag Crypto explains that a continuous price decline to successfully retest this price floor may ignite a rally, pushing XRP to its current all-time high of $3.84. However, any decisive price break below $2.65 could create a rather dire situation, pointing to potential lows around $2.19. Related Reading: Exchanges Receive 21,400 Bitcoin At A Loss From Short-Term Holders ‚Äì Retail Capitulation? XRP Surge To $17 Remains On The Cards In other news, Egrag Crypto‚Äôs analysis also reveals that XRP remains in a macro, long-term cyclical pattern that shows a multi-year bullish cycle, with recurring structural traits. The key elements in this pattern include bullish pennant formation, which suggests a continuation pattern, the 21 EMA (Green dotted line) that historically aligns with significant trend shifts, the Support Arc (Red line), and the Market Cycle Top (blue line). Notably, XRP has since emerged from the bull pennant signaling intentions to maintain its current uptrend. However, the altcoin faces an insurmountable resistance around $3.84, which aligns with an intersection between the mid-cycle top and the 21 EMA line. If XRP can successfully break past this price barrier, investors should anticipate a direct rally to the projected cycle top $17, representing a potential 525% gain on present market prices. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.81, reflecting a 5.32% decline in the past day as earlier stated.

Bitcoin dropped below $113,000, while Ethereum dipped under $3,500. Several altcoins also saw notable declines, and overall trading volumes spiked as prices moved sharply. Key Stats and Events More than 114,000 traders saw positions closed due to liquidations, totaling over $368 million in value. The majority of these were long positions, as prices dropped quickly across the board. The largest single liquidation was on Binance, where a $2.58 million Solana position was closed automatically. New U.S. tariffs and uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy contributed to a cautious trading environment, encouraging some investors to reduce risk. The release of additional tokens from projects like SUI and Ethena also increased selling pressure. Industry and Community Response BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sold more than $13 million worth of digital assets, including ETH, ENA, and PEPE, and commented that further correction is possible under current economic conditions. On the other hand, Eric Trump took to social media, encouraging investors to consider whether current prices may be an opportunity to buy. While some investors opted to step back, others are watching the market for potential entry points or looking for early signs of recovery.

Key Takeaways: Arkham has revealed an undisclosed 2020 hack of 127,426 BTC from Chinese mining pool LuBian. The attack exploited weaknesses in LuBian‚Äôs private key system, with over 90% of its BTC drained in a single day. LuBian attempted to contact the hacker via Bitcoin‚Äôs OP_RETURN feature. On Saturday, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that 127,426 BTC, valued at around $3.5 billion at the time and nearly $14.5 billion today, was stolen from Chinese mining pool LuBian in December 2020. LuBian rose quickly in early 2020, becoming the sixth-largest mining pool on the Bitcoin network by mid-year. Its website promoted it as ‚Äúthe safest high yielding mining pool in the world.‚Äù LuBian Vanished in 2021, Sparking Speculation of Shutdown By February 2021, LuBian had disappeared without explanation, fueling speculation that it was either shut down by authorities or quietly converted into a private pool. Arkham‚Äôs investigation points to a more dramatic exit: a hack that drained the pool‚Äôs holdings. ‚ÄúThey appear to have been first hacked on December 28th, 2020 for over 90% of their BTC,‚Äù Arkham wrote. The following day, attackers siphoned off another $6 million in BTC and USDT from a LuBian-linked address on the Bitcoin Omni layer. The firm believes the Bitcoin theft stemmed from vulnerabilities in LuBian‚Äôs private key generation system, which may have allowed brute-force attacks. While 11,886 BTC, worth roughly $1.35 billion, remains untouched in LuBian‚Äôs wallet, none of the stolen coins have moved since July 2024. Interestingly, LuBian attempted to communicate with the attacker using Bitcoin‚Äôs OP_RETURN feature. BREAKING: ARKHAM UNCOVERS $3.5B HEIST ‚Äì THE LARGEST EVER LuBian was a Chinese mining pool with facilities in China & Iran.

While the Mt. Gox collapse involved more BTC, the LuBian breach is the largest confirmed crypto theft by value at the time of the incident. Bitcoin Hacks, Theft Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK‚Äôs latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit‚Äôs $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol‚Äôs $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year‚Äôs losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events. The report also pointed to rising sophistication of phishing schemes and ongoing risks from social engineering, urging crypto users to verify links, avoid suspicious sites, and use hardware wallets.

In an interview on the Excess Returns YouTube channel, Liz Ann Sonders says investors prefer a calm and steady Fed, even amid pressure from President Trump to cut rates, as inflation remains elevated. Sonders also notes that the Fed‚Äôs current pause is perfectly in line with its mandate of low inflation and maximum employment. ‚ÄúI think part of the reason why the market is doing well is because the Fed is not cutting. A combination of because they‚Äôre not bowing to political pressure, and oh and by the way, neither side of their dual mandate suggests that they should be cutting. Financial conditions are easy. The unemployment rate is steady, actually has been coming down. Inflation is still above their target. So the conditions just don‚Äôt suggest that they should be easing.‚Äù The investor points out that a Fed rate cut at this stage could backfire by tightening financial conditions and triggering a market drop. She explains that borrowing costs are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, a rate determined by market forces and not directly set by the Fed. The Charles Schwab executive warns that a cut could push yields higher, making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs a distinct possibility that if the market feels the Fed is prematurely lowering rates, doesn‚Äôt have the incentive to do that based on their mandate, that you could have a repeat of what happened as recently as last fall ‚Äì when the Fed cut by a 100 basis points and the Fed funds rate and the 10-year yield over the same exact span of time went up by a 100 basis points. So this idea that if we just get the Fed to cut rates, that that eases borrowing costs for companies and brings mortgage rates down, suggests a misunderstanding of what rate it is that is tied to borrowing rates for corporations, for individuals. I think part of the reason why the market has done well is because the Fed doesn‚Äôt have the conditions that suggest easing.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the disclosures, Ripple has applied for a license to establish a limited-purpose national trust bank. According to the application, this new structure aims to hold Ripple's RLUSD (Ripple USD) reserves and establish a regulated infrastructure for tokenized financial products. It also raises the possibility of direct access to the Fed in the future. According to WrathofKahneman, this initiative isn't targeting individual users. According to the Banking Comprehensive Revision Act (CRA), the regulation doesn't apply to banks that don't provide loans or take deposits and only offer trust-based services. This suggests Ripple's new structure will focus solely on business (B2B) services. Related News: Market Prophet Tom Lee Shares His Bullish Prediction on Ethereum (ETH) Price Ripple's Application Doesn't Provide Any XRP Details Another notable detail is that the application doesn't directly mention XRP. Analysts note that Ripple is attempting to clearly separate XRP from its banking license, aiming to avoid regulatory confusion. However, there's no indication that future XRP integrations are completely ruled out. The application details that Ripple Labs would own the bank, issue special shares to its executives, and that much of the application was kept confidential. This secrecy was interpreted as a sign of a potential initial public offering (IPO) plan. As a result, Ripple is aiming for a national bank license to create a regulated subsidiary to manage its tokenization infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-03 09:00:36,49459696,1754211636,Ripple CTO: What to be Used If XRP Ledger Is Restarted from Scratch,"Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz recently explored the idea of modernizing the XRP Ledger‚Äôs core components, including the possibility of a modular architecture and a Rust-based implementation. The comments came during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session hosted by XRPL Commons and were shared on X by crypto commentator Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba), who posted a clip highlighting the exchange. Despite XRPL‚Äôs longstanding performance and reliability , Schwartz did not shy away from identifying architectural inefficiencies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of annoying that you have a monolith that has the consensus engine, the transaction engine, and client queries all monolithically,‚Äù he said. Schwartz, who is one of the architects of the XRPL , explained that the tightly coupled components have made it difficult to implement enhancements or enable interoperability with alternative implementations. Decisions are being made today. If restarting the #XRP ledger from scratch, Ripple CTO David Schwartz discusses using ""Rust"" is definitely talked about. Proposals from an outside company are currently being considered for a possible modular revamp of pieces. (Rust is a‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DzEpY3gQNv ‚Äî Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) August 2, 2025 Moving Toward a More Modular Architecture One solution under consideration is modularization of the transaction engine, possibly enabling it to run within a virtual machine. That shift could separate the core logic from the client-facing overlay and database components, free to evolve independently. Rust has emerged as a candidate for such a reimplementation. When asked why the ledger wasn‚Äôt already being rebuilt in Rust, Schwartz noted that discussions about doing exactly that are happening. He emphasized that the difficulty lies in untangling the existing architecture, especially the payment engine. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz explained that parts of the payment engine are difficult to define clearly, which makes rebuilding or re-implementing them challenging. Some behaviors depend on the order of operations in ways that aren‚Äôt consistently documented. To address this, he suggested rewriting those components with clearer, more predictable logic and possibly introducing formal definitions to guide future implementations. A cleaner, more consistent version would make the system easier to maintain and could help future improvements, enhancing XRP‚Äôs appeal in the global financial ecosystem . Proposals Under Review Ripple is currently reviewing external proposals to undertake parts of this effort, and Schwartz mentioned that decisions are being made about the feasibility and prioritization of such initiatives. He pointed to Aanchal Malhotra, board member and head of research at RippleX, as someone leading aspects of that process. XRP is already highly appealing to institutions , and upgrading its functionality through a modern programming language like Rust could increase institutional confidence in the asset and potentially raise adoption rates.

2025-08-03 08:53:00,49459695,1754211180,Trader loses $908K to 458-day-old fake transaction,"A crypto user has fallen victim to a sophisticated wallet-draining scam, losing $908,551 in USD Coin (USDC) nearly 16 months after unknowingly authorizing a malicious smart contract. Onchain data reveals the approval transaction was signed on April 30, 2024 ‚Äî but the theft occurred much later, on August 2, 2025. This incident marks yet another alarming breach in the crypto space. The attack began with an ERC-20 approval transaction, likely embedded in a fake airdrop or a spoofed legitimate-looking website. The victim unknowingly signed the transaction, granting the scammer access to their funds. Scammer strikes 458 days later as dormant wallet springs to life The scammer‚Äôs wallet had a disreputable pink-drainer.eth address, ‚Äú0x67E5Ae‚Äù, where the stolen $908,551 worth of USDC stablecoin was received. The attack was carried out on August 2 at 4:57 AM UTC, according to Scam Sniffer‚Äôs X post . This was 458 days, just after the victim accidentally approved a transaction that appeared to be legit on April 30, 2024. The unexpected attack has raised security concerns among crypto users. To address this, Scam Sniffer, a firm that keenly monitors malicious activities in the crypto space, called for the urgency of digital asset users taking caution before approving the transactions. According to the firm, users should check their approvals often. For the old ones, they should cancel them to avoid exposing their funds to scammers, emphasizing the importance of their wallet security. In the highlighted case, the compromised wallet had only seen minimal, low-value transactions up until a month before the theft, making it unlikely to attract immediate attention from scammers. The user decided to move $762,397 into a wallet with the address 0x6c0eB6 from a MetaMask wallet on July 2 at 8:41 PM UTC. Ten minutes later, the user transferred another $146,154 in USDC to the same wallet from a Kraken account. At this time, the scammer was monitoring the movement of the funds, waiting for the right time to attack while giving the user more time to see if she or he could add more funds to the wallet. The attack took place on August 2. Crypto fraud attack raises tension among investors Investigators noted that the scammer used tactics typical of a phishing approval attack , closely monitoring the victim‚Äôs transactions before executing the theft. Following such attacks, crypto authorities included stricter measures users should take while approving transactions. For example, they have introduced Etherscan‚Äôs Token Approval checker for Ethereum users, enabling them to review and cancel any token approval that is not needed. However, each cancellation process is charged a gas fee. Meanwhile, research from sources reveals that in July alone, the total stolen funds amounted to more than $142 million in the crypto ecosystem. This involves at least 17 attacks, with crypto exchange CoinDCX suffering the highest losses. Still, crypto users are worried about the security of their funds. Some have highlighted that this scammer has not been identified and arrested, which makes them even more worried. Others have called for more security measures to be effected.

In the press release , the platform notes that the initiative is expected to be the first community-authorized core development funding for the blockchain network. The press statement notes that the approval is expected to birth not just a set of technical upgrades, but also a shared vision for the future of Cardano, which is grounded in transparency, accountability, and momentum. The approved roadmap was designed in alignment with community priorities and approved earlier this year, revealing one of the most ambitious development phases in the Chain‚Äôs history. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson mentioned at the time that the new approach is expected to introduce agile engineering teams to achieve a faster execution of the platform‚Äôs goals. Cardano community greenlights funding to support network upgrades The approved funding is expected to go to major upgrades, focusing on scalability, developer experience, and interoperability. The key developments will include Ouroboros Leios for increased throughput, Hydra for fast and cheap transactions, Mithril improvements for reduced bootstrap times, and Project Acropolis for modular node architecture, which will enable greater flexibility and easier onboarding of new core developers. In addition, there are also plans for performance optimization, which is expected to improve sync times and reduce RAM usage, and nested transactions, which will provide a technical foundation for more advanced smart contracts and seamless interoperability. According to Tim Harrison, the EVP Community & Ecosystem at Input Output, this development is a milestone for the platform. Harrison noted that for the first time, major protocol developments will be funded directly by the community. He noted that the move empowers the firm with the needed confidence to move forward, adding that they need to show ‚Äúfull transparency, shared responsibility, and a renewed commitment to building an open, resilient ecosystem.‚Äù New updates will lay the groundwork for better performance These upgrades are expected to lay the groundwork for a more scalable, accessible Cardano with better performance, unlocking new capabilities for builders and users. Aside from delivering on its promises, Cardano is also expected to support wider participation by onboarding external vendors, with most of them expected to join from the Cardano Developer Ecosystem Coalition (CDEC). According to its press statement, Cardano expects to build capacity, transfer knowledge, and help contributors stand as independent proposers in future funding rounds, strengthening decentralization over time. The funding structure is expected to integrate milestone-based payments administered by Intersect, with releases based on verified delivery. IOE will provide monthly updates, engineering timesheets, and quarterly budget reports that will be checked by the community. ‚ÄúSecuring this funding is just the start,‚Äù said Ricky Rand, General Manager, Input | Output Engineering. ‚ÄúThis is a vote of confidence in Cardano‚Äôs future‚Äîand a model for how decentralized funding and delivery can work at scale. The real work begins now‚Äîdelivering with integrity, reporting with transparency, and building with and for the community.‚Äù Reacting to the update, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, took to blogging platform X to show his support for the development. He thanks the crypto community for their unwavering support, urging them to let them get it done. Meanwhile, crypto community members have also supported the move, with a user noting that the future of the chain is now in the hands of ADA holders, which is a good thing for the project and a vote of confidence for Hoskinson.

2025-08-03 08:34:45,49458730,1754210085,Five Key Factors in XRP Prices Hitting $5 In The Next 5 Months,"That‚Äôs what several cryptocurrency market experts and altcoin analysts are predicting for XRP‚Äôs price with August already here. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs continues to expand its business as corporations and even the US government move to add XRP to their digital asset portfolios to balance out their treasuries. Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, DC has done a complete 180-degree about-face since Trump‚Äôs reelection. The SEC has shifted from an aggressively and relentlessly hostile stance toward Ripple Labs to one that is cooperative and helpful. In addition to that, the company is making enormous strides forward in Q3 2025 to expand its borderless payments business for large transactions between big institutions. XRP Outshines US Stocks in July It‚Äôs a very bullish forward view for XRP prices as August begins, especially compared to returns from US stocks, like the benchmark S&P 500 Index. July was a big month for the US stock market, which grew to a historic record high level again on Monday, along with the Nasdaq Composite. That‚Äôs despite worries over Trump‚Äôs tax reforms and global tariff policies. But XRP holders made significantly greater gains than US stock shareholders in July. The S&P 500 Index delivered +2.67% gains for the 30 days ending Tuesday, July 29. Meanwhile, XRP‚Äôs price flew up on crypto exchanges by over +42%, from $2.20 on Jun. 30 to $3.13 on Jul. 29. It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that both asset classes slashed some of the gains as July ended and on Autva e gust 1 due to political concerns and economic uncertainty. During most of its history since launching in 1957, S&P 500 Index stocks would typically take four years to deliver those kinds of gains that XRP delivered in 30 consecutive days this summer.¬†That‚Äôs not the first time Ripple‚Äôs token has given such an incredibly positive performance. Its average trading price performed similarly this past January, last November, and during the Bitcoin bull markets in 2021 and 2017. Here are five key factors analysts are weighing, who say XRP is going as high as $5 in the next five months. 1. Altcoin Analyst Predicts $5 XRP By 2026 Altcoin Daily co-founder Aaron Arnold, in an update posted on July 25, explained that he believes XRP is going to $5 and beyond because it‚Äôs not merely a currency, but crucially important digital infrastructure for global payments. He said that Ripple‚Äôs new stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December 2024, will be a primary driver of XRP‚Äôs market gains for the rest of this crypto cycle. Unpopular opinion: Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD might be the most underrated stablecoin of 2025 ‚Äì Went from the #36 stablecoin to #17 ranking in 6 months -604% growth (2nd fastest YTD) ‚Äì $348M in inflows Even more suprising is that of ~83% RLUSD is on Ethereum, not on Ripple. pic.twitter.com/E1qUMjeedc ‚Äî J.Hackworth (@jphackworth42) June 19, 2025 Every time there‚Äôs a transaction on XRP Ledger, some of the XRP is burned to increase scarcity and create price support for the currency. ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs stablecoin RLUSD is the key,‚Äù Arnold said. That‚Äôs because XRP is a relatively scarce, supply-limited token, and the growth of RLUSD increases the demand for XRP while leaving it in shorter supply. RLUSD has already captured a market cap well north of half a billion dollars in July. All other factors equalized, the Ripple stablecoin‚Äôs rapid adoption is good business and economics for XRP valuations to continue rising in 2025. 2. XRP Corporate Treasury Race Begins Meanwhile, as online traders use more XRP to move stablecoins around the blockchain, at least one corporate finance department is raising $20 million in funds to pile up an XRP treasury. Nature‚Äôs Miracle Holdings is a California-based farm tech firm that provides equipment for indoor, greenhouse, and vertical farming operations. They‚Äôre publicly traded in the United States on OTC Markets, with a very small market cap of less than $2 million. The company announced on 7/23 that it is raising $20 million in an equity finance deal approved by the SEC to stash a corporate XRP treasury. Moreover, that would make it the first non-financial public company to buy a big tranche of XRP. Nature‚Äôs Miracle CEO James Li said you can blame the company‚Äôs big strategic pivot on Trump and Congress for creating more regulatory clarity around blockchain with the GENIUS Act. ‚ÄúWe see the huge potential of XRP as it improves the speed and reduces the cost of cross-border payments,‚Äù Li said. 3. Ripple Pump Incoming From US Stockpile BIG: White House to unveil national crypto stockpile report this Wednesday! $XRP rumored to be on the list alongside BTC & ETH. Is XRP becoming a strategic U.S. digital asset? pic.twitter.com/sOywwGNF5S ‚Äî Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) July 27, 2025 In addition to corporate treasury interest in XRP stockpiles, the US federal government wants its hands on Ripple tokens. In fact, President Trump has specifically named XRP as one of the assets the White House wants to hold in trust for Americans. The White House‚Äôs crypto report on blockchain and the national digital assets stockpile, released on July 30, provides¬†solid support for XRP price levels. Meanwhile, Americans applying for federal housing loans are now permitted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to list crypto like XRP as financial assets while holding them, without selling them for cash instead. So the US government is shaping up to be a massive bull factor in XRP prices for the remainder of 2025, as well as going forward up to 2030 and beyond. 4. Ripple New US Patent: A Threat to SWIFT? JUST IN: Ripple secures U.S. patent for trust-based, instant cross-border payments‚Äîno full network confirmation needed. $XRP might slowly replace SWIFT, offering a faster and more efficient alternative. pic.twitter.com/op8Yn1sfQy ‚Äî Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) July 27, 2025 RippleNet and XRP Ledger are global, borderless, automated payment and financial networks.¬†Across the pond from the US, Ripple is expanding its business in Europe as well. In July, a representative from Ripple told journalists the company is applying for a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe for regulatory compliance. Consequently, the company will find it easier to expand its operations in the Eurozone. Moreover, Ripple got US Patent No. 11,998,003 approved in July for an international payments network that settles much faster than the world‚Äôs most popular cross-border payments rails, based out of Belgium, SWIFT. Running the math on it, if XRP payments using RippleNet and XRP Ledger capture 14% of SWIFT‚Äôs market share for daily transaction services, XRP‚Äôs price could go to Mars and Jupiter. 5. Bitcoin Bull Run to $150K-200K In 2025 Finally, if Bitcoin‚Äôs price rises to $175,000 or $200,000, as many professional market analysts believe it will, it could be an easy ride up for XRP tokens from $3 a token to $5 XRP in 2025. In fact, XRP‚Äôs price gained 518% in just 77 days, the last time Bitcoin rallied 50% from last Nov. 4 to Jan. 20. If it did that again from the current price level, XRP could skyrocket to $19.30.

2025-08-03 08:34:08,49458795,1754210048,"Analyst to XRP Holders: Relax Friends, This Dip Is Almost Over. Here‚Äôs why","XRP‚Äôs recent decline has unsettled parts of the crypto community, especially after the asset reached a peak of $3.65 in July. Since then, the bullish momentum has cooled considerably. The asset is trading at $2.82, a 5.43% drop from yesterday, having fallen below the psychologically significant $3 support level recently. Despite the sharp downturn, not all analysts are signaling alarm. In a post on X, well-known trader and market analyst CryptoBull shared a 4-hour chart suggesting that XRP may be approaching the tail end of its current corrective move. According to CryptoBull, ‚Äúthis XRP dip is almost over.‚Äù Relax friends, this #XRP dip is almost over. pic.twitter.com/l6wdmoo6Jx ‚Äî CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 2, 2025 A Falling Wedge Forms on the 4-Hour Chart The chart, which covers price action from mid-July to early August, displays a falling wedge formation , a classic technical pattern that often precedes a bullish breakout. The narrowing price action is marked by descending resistance and support lines converging toward the current price. The pattern is visible across multiple lower highs and lower lows, with the recent price action testing the wedge‚Äôs lower boundary below $2.8. This setup indicates weakening selling pressure, even as prices decline. Volume analysis within the chart also shows a tapering pattern, consistent with a potential exhaustion of downward momentum. XRP Support Levels Suggest Bearish Exhaustion Although XRP has seen a notable decline from its recent peak , the current chart positioning implies it may be nearing a technical support level. The downward sloping wedge has not yet broken to the upside, but such patterns often act as precursors to bullish reversals once a breakout occurs with conviction and volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, the absence of a confirmed breakout means traders should remain cautious. If XRP fails to hold the lower trendline around $2.7, the price could continue to slide, testing deeper levels of support. On the other hand, if buying pressure increases and XRP breaks above the upper resistance line currently just below $3, it may signal a return of upward momentum. Is An XRP Reversal Coming? CryptoBull‚Äôs chart interpretation comes at a moment of uncertainty for XRP holders. While the recent price action has been bearish, the structure shown on the 4-hour chart provides a technical basis for optimism. Other analysts have expressed confidence that XRP‚Äôs recovery is imminent , and the next few sessions could prove critical in confirming whether this dip is indeed near its end or if further downside awaits.

In a note to clients seen by Reuters , Goldman Sachs says hedge funds took profits on their tech positions just as the S&P 500 index hit all-time highs. The bank says tech stocks were sold off by hedge funds in the US and Europe more than any other sector last week, and was the largest exodus from the field since July 2024. Goldman also notes that every type of tech stock was sold, including semiconductor chip companies, software firms and IT service providers. While tech stocks sold off, the bank says hedge funds began shifting their capital to consumer staples, or goods that consumers purchase regularly regardless of the economic climate. Goldman says the big winners included companies that sell food and beverages, and personal care products. Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, tells Reuters that yields on long bonds may determine US equities‚Äô next move, but they haven‚Äôt yet flashed any clear signals. ‚ÄúUS equities valuations (such as price earnings ratios) are now 30% higher than their recent decade average, while 10-year yields remain stubbornly high and volatile.

This correction has sparked a divide among analysts and investors, with some viewing it as a healthy retracement that could set the stage for a continuation of the broader uptrend. Others, however, warn that this move might signal the beginning of a more extended bearish phase if key support levels fail to hold. Related Reading: Ethereum New Addresses Surge To Nearly 257K In A Day, Matching 2017 And 2021 Bull Markets Adding to the market‚Äôs uncertainty, top analyst Darkfost highlighted a significant shift in exchange activity. Data reveals that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have been steadily rising since early July, reversing a prolonged downtrend that had been in place since March. Given Binance‚Äôs position as the largest global crypto exchange by volume, this uptick in inflows is a crucial indicator of shifting investor behavior. Whether this trend signals an upcoming wave of selling or simply reflects portfolio rebalancing remains to be seen. The coming days will be pivotal as Bitcoin tests its lower demand zones and market sentiment reacts to this new data. Binance Bitcoin Inflows Signal Shift in Market Mood Darkfost shared critical data showing that Bitcoin inflows to Binance have steadily increased, rising from approximately 5,300 BTC daily in early July to 7,000 BTC today. While this uptick is not abrupt, it marks a significant reversal of a prolonged downtrend that had persisted since March. This change suggests that investor behavior is shifting, potentially signaling adjustments in market strategies as traders and institutions respond to evolving market dynamics. Binance, as the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by trading volume, serves as a critical barometer for overall market sentiment. With over 250 million users and billions of dollars in daily transactions, fluctuations in Bitcoin inflows on this platform often mirror broader structural moves within the crypto market. Historically, rising inflows have been associated with increased trading activity, whether due to profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or anticipation of market volatility. Some analysts interpret this emerging trend of accelerating inflows as an early sign of preparation for heightened market volatility or impending macroeconomic shifts. It could indicate that traders are positioning funds on exchanges to either capitalize on price swings or hedge against potential downside risks. While the magnitude of inflows isn‚Äôt alarmingly high yet, the consistency of this rise demands attention. The market is watching closely to see whether this signals a temporary adjustment or the start of a broader trend. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price currently testing lower support zones after breaking below $115K, the behavior of these inflows will be pivotal in determining short-term price action.

Key Support At Risk Amid Increased Selling Pressure Bitcoin is trading at $112,477 after breaking down from its two-week consolidation range. The price lost the crucial $115,724 support, which now flips into immediate resistance. This breakdown marks a significant shift in momentum, with BTC testing the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $114,944, which failed to hold. The next key support zone lies near the 200-day SMA at $110,348, a level that could become pivotal for bulls attempting to regain control. Volume has surged during this decline, indicating strong selling pressure as BTC approaches the $112,000 level. If the price fails to hold above this zone, a further drop towards the psychological $110K level seems likely, with potential for a deeper correction targeting previous accumulation ranges from early July. Related Reading: Ethereum Taker Sell Volume Hits $335M In Just 2 Minutes: Panic Or Profit-Taking? Despite the bearish short-term outlook, bulls still have a chance to reclaim momentum if they can swiftly push BTC back above $115,724 and establish a consolidation above the 50-day SMA at $117,631.

2025-08-03 07:58:26,49457460,1754207906,Analyst: I Repeat- $6-$8 XRP Price In August Highly Likely,"While XRP has faced pressure in recent sessions, a new analysis suggests that the current correction could be nearing completion. In a chart posted on August 2, trader and crypto analyst Xoom (@Mr_Xoom) outlined a potential bullish reversal zone as XRP trades around the $2.93 mark. The chart indicates a classic five-wave Elliott Wave pattern , where wave 5 is projected to finalize around $2.8. The chart highlights a series of lower highs and lower lows from late July into early August. After completing Waves 1 to 5, the chart outlines the potential endpoint, which falls around the $2.8 zone that Xoom previously set as the XRP‚Äôs lowest point for this cycle. XRP Ltf wave 5 coming to an end. I repeat- $6-$8 XRP in August highly likely. https://t.co/whkoyP1vM5 pic.twitter.com/2lPXPs5ybR ‚Äî xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 2, 2025 Support Zone Under Scrutiny XRP recently experienced a notable decline, falling below the crucial $3 support zone . It has failed to reclaim this level, causing some concern among market participants. Xoom outlined this level on the chart, as it held up XRP in July after the asset retraced from its all-time high . Although XRP has broken through this support, Xoom is confident in the technical structure and anticipates a recovery. Despite the recent decline, XRP has remained above the highlighted support at $2.8, and the current forecast implies that once wave 5 concludes, a larger reversal could follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bearish Momentum is Slowing Down Elliott Wave theory, the analytical framework used in the chart, typically identifies patterns of investor behavior. A completed five-wave downtrend often precedes a corrective rally or a new impulsive move in the opposite direction. In this case, Xoom appears to anticipate the latter, which would imply a significant upside breakout if the projected reversal plays out. At the time of Xoom‚Äôs analysis, XRP sat slightly above the $2.8 support, trading around $2.93. The bearish sequence, while still active, appears to be losing momentum, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Outlook for August Remains Bullish Despite the short-term bearish structure, the forecast remains optimistic over the coming weeks. Xoom reiterated his previous target, stating that XRP reaching $6 to $8 in August is highly likely . The projected target range represents a more than 2x increase from current levels at the minimum. While that may seem ambitious, the underlying structure of the wave analysis supports the case for a trend shift if the $2.80 support holds firm.

The image, described as one of the most comprehensive and clear visualizations of XRP‚Äôs total supply, reiterates the essential breakdown of XRP holdings, including those in escrow, in active circulation, and under Ripple‚Äôs control. The data visualization provides insight into how XRP is distributed across different categories, emphasizing the constraints on Ripple‚Äôs ability to liquidate large portions of the asset. Still the best infographic about total #XRP circulation, updated. (SBI Holdings fiscal year end report) ~36b left in escrow.. pic.twitter.com/GniV4tFO3P ‚Äî WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 1, 2025 XRP Market Circulation and Total Supply The maximum supply of XRP remains capped at 100 billion tokens. According to the infographic, approximately 59.24 billion XRP are in active circulation within the market. At the time of reporting, this portion of XRP carries a market capitalization of approximately 28.6 trillion Japanese yen, based on pricing data from July 28. This figure reflects a substantial segment of the total supply and constitutes the portion that is freely tradable across exchanges and platforms. Ripple‚Äôs Non-Circulating Holdings As of the end of March 2025, Ripple held a significant volume of XRP that had not entered the market. These holdings are categorized as being outside of current market circulation and are valued at approximately 13.4 trillion yen. By July 20, 2025, the infographic reports that Ripple‚Äôs non-circulating holdings are equivalent to 19.7 trillion yen, which suggests that the valuation is based on a revised XRP price as of July 28. These tokens represent a portion of the supply Ripple retains direct control over, yet has not introduced into active trading markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Under Escrow and Burned Supply A prominent feature of the report is the quantification of XRP held under escrow . Roughly 35.9 billion XRP remain locked under the escrow mechanism. The infographic explains that XRP placed in escrow on the XRP Ledger is restricted from use or destruction until specific conditions are met. The escrow system was established to promote predictability and ensure responsible token release over time. Based on ledger data available as of July 20, 2025, the report confirms that nearly 40% of the total XRP supply is still under escrow, and thus, Ripple is not at liberty to sell or distribute these tokens at will. In addition to circulating and escrowed tokens, the infographic indicates that approximately 10 million XRP have been permanently removed from the total supply through transaction fees. These burned tokens represent a fraction of the total but reflect the deflationary nature of the transaction cost model built into the XRP Ledger. Summary of Data Presentation and Source The quantities shown in the infographic are derived from XRP Ledger data as of July 20, 2025, and the monetary valuations are calculated using XRP‚Äôs market price as of July 28. WrathofKahneman referred to the updated image as ‚Äústill the best infographic about total XRP circulation,‚Äù highlighting its clarity and the credibility of its source, which is SBI Holdings. The visual report illustrates the current landscape of XRP distribution in quantifiable detail and offers transparency on Ripple‚Äôs available and restricted holdings.

2025-08-03 07:19:07,49457457,1754205547,BlackRock and Ripple Are Acting In Sync Quietly but on a Massive Scale,"Crypto enthusiast Cosmos has presented a detailed analysis asserting that Ripple and BlackRock are acting in coordination to reshape the financial system through tokenization. According to Cosmo, both entities are quietly aligning operations, timelines, and personnel to build a tokenized infrastructure that affects not just financial instruments, but also identity, medical data, and global market architecture. The claims, supported by multiple references to known partnerships and developments, attempt to demonstrate a systemic realignment of the digital asset space led by Ripple and BlackRock. Cosmo opens the thread by stating that BlackRock and Ripple have ‚Äújust been exposed,‚Äù and suggests they are using tokenization as a vehicle to control financial markets. The tweet asserts that the same assets are being targeted, within the same timeframe, and involving the same key players behind both initiatives. The central argument is that this coordinated effort is being largely overlooked despite its significant implications for crypto holders and the broader financial ecosystem. Ripple‚Äôs Role in Tokenizing Traditional Assets Cosmo traces the beginning of this effort to Ripple‚Äôs early work in tokenizing U.S. Treasury bonds using the XRP Ledger . This was done through the OUSG fund, which is accessible in tokenized form on-chain 24/7. According to Cosmo, this marks a fundamental shift in how traditional securities are accessed and transferred. He further notes that BlackRock has allocated capital into this very fund, highlighting their indirect participation in the XRPL tokenization effort . 1^ ‚ú∞ BlackRock and Ripple are acting in sync ‚Äì quietly but on a massive scale ‚ú∞ They are launching tokenization to rewrite the financial system ‚ú∞ Same assets ‚Äì same timeline ‚Äì same people ‚Äì and no one is asking questions pic.twitter.com/OqcdS41fhA ‚Äî Cosmo (@0xcosmobtc) July 31, 2025 Ondo Finance is identified as the intermediary platform responsible for launching the OUSG token. Cosmo describes Ondo as a fintech project led by former Goldman Sachs executives. The role breakdown, as Cosmo explains, places Ripple as the provider of the blockchain infrastructure, Ondo as the issuer of the tokenized instruments, and BlackRock as the source of capital liquidity. He also notes that Ripple‚Äôs legal clarity following its partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 was a strategic milestone that enabled this expansion into institutional partnerships. New Developments Involving Bio-Identification and the XRP Ledger A point of coincidence emphasized by Cosmo is the ticker symbol $XDNA. BlackRock currently has a genetics ETF trading under this ticker. Meanwhile, on July 4, 2025, a token with the same ticker, $XDNA, is set to launch on the XRP Ledger. Cosmo states that this new token is being issued by DNA Protocol and is centered on biometric identity infrastructure, medical data access, and genomics, rather than trading. He states that the XRPL will serve as the foundational blockchain for this infrastructure, further demonstrating Ripple‚Äôs reach into areas beyond finance. This development, according to Cosmo, represents the convergence of healthcare data, biometric identification, and tokenized infrastructure within a single blockchain environment. He notes that this should not be viewed in isolation but rather as an extension of Ripple‚Äôs broader role in building systems for the next era of digital infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock‚Äôs Expanding Blockchain Integration Cosmo also refers to the ISO 20022 messaging standard , currently being implemented by FedWire, SWIFT, and global banks. He points out that Ripple‚Äôs systems have been compatible with ISO 20022 from inception. In contrast, BlackRock‚Äôs Aladdin software, which manages over $20 trillion in assets, is now testing blockchain networks for settlement and transaction tracking. Cosmos states that XRPL supports ISO 20022 and operates without interruption, positioning it as a viable base layer for next-generation financial systems. According to Cosmo, the two firms are dividing responsibilities across multiple verticals. Ripple is focusing on the tokenization of government bonds, central bank digital currencies, land, and carbon markets. BlackRock is focusing on tokenizing equities, U.S. treasuries, real estate, and digital identity. Cosmo interprets this as a dual effort to reboot the global financial system from the ground up, operating in unison but through separate domains. Effect on the Broader Crypto Market In the final portion of the thread, Cosmo argues that the implications of this transformation affect all crypto holders. He says that anyone holding assets like Ethereum or Solana is already part of this evolving structure, regardless of whether they are aware. Cosmo warns that the shift is not about adopting a new market, but rather transitioning the current system into a more centralized form under different management. He ends the thread with a caution that this transformation is not optional. According to his view, tokenization led by Ripple and BlackRock is already in motion, and retail participants are being absorbed into an institutional framework without a clear understanding of the broader design.

2025-08-03 07:12:20,49457384,1754205140,Dogecoin Dragged Lower by Outflows With Technicals Flagging Bearish Continuation,"Dogecoin fell 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), slipping from $0.20 to as low as $0.19 amid sharp spikes in trading activity and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins. What to Know DOGE traded in a volatile $0.01 range (7.14%) during the session, declining from $0.20 to $0.19 before staging a mild bounce. Volume surged to 918.53M at 06:00 and 502.81M at 14:00, both exceeding the 24H average of 385.67M, signaling high-conviction exits. Support formed around $0.188‚Äì$0.190, where volume spiked to 667.44M, enabling a brief recovery to $0.194. Resistance held at $0.202‚Äì$0.203, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. News Background DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets. Price Action Summary High: $0.203 Low: $0.188 Close: $0.195 24H Range: $0.015 (7.14%) Technical Analysis DOGE encountered aggressive resistance at the $0.202‚Äì$0.203 zone, rejecting multiple rallies. The $0.188‚Äì$0.190 region absorbed peak selling pressure, with high-volume prints suggesting bottom-fishing or accumulation interest. The final 60-minute session (03:55‚Äì04:54) saw a measured 0.53% drop from $0.196 to $0.195, with intra-candle resistance at $0.1963 and support near $0.1952. Volumes normalized late in the session, but remain above baseline, indicating potential for continued volatility.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX‚Äôs on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: ‚ÄúDoes dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWill dYdX ever go up?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere will dYdX be in 5 years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

As a result, buyers are now holding dYdX price around resistance lines, preparing for further upward push. The 24-hour volume surged to $5.07 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.539, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around 38, hinting that sellers are dominating.

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX‚Äôs price holds momentum above $0.6081, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6621. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5036, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4396. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers lost confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.54 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.5 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility.

Houston resident Sharon Schoolcraft says she lost $13,000 after receiving a call from someone claiming to be working at Wells Fargo, reports FOX 26. Schoolcraft says the caller alerted her to possible fraudulent charges made to her account, a facade made believable by the fact that the scammer knew about recent charges she had legitimately made. The scammer subsequently told Schoolcraft that someone would come to her home to cut up or collect her cut-up Wells Fargo debit card. Similar scams have affected other Wells Fargo customers. Recent reports suggest a trend of scammers convincing the bank‚Äôs customers that their accounts are at risk, tricking them into giving up their PINs, cutting up their bank cards and then meeting someone in person to hand over the cut-up cards so the thieves can either withdraw funds or transfer money out of the accounts. In previous instances, when requesting a refund from the bank, the victims were denied by Wells Fargo. However, the bank‚Äôs decision changed when the media investigated the matter. Similarly, Wells Fargo only agreed to refund Schoolcraft her stolen $13,000 after the media got involved. Says Schoolcraft, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so super stoked, it‚Äôs going to mean a lot to me. I can pay back the person I had to borrow money from. I can get my bills back on track.

His market outlook, tied to worsening macroeconomic indicators and a potential U.S. tariff bill, has sparked conversation across the industry ahead of his scheduled keynote at WebX Asia in Tokyo later this month. The move came to light after Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics platform, posted on X that Hayes had sold large quantities of Ether (ETH), Ethena (ENA), and PEPE tokens in a short window. The transactions, executed within six hours, sent clear signals of a major repositioning by one of the most closely followed voices in the crypto space. Arthur Hayes‚Äô transfer history. Source: Arkham Intelligence Hayes explains his bearish sentiment on the macro picture In a follow-up post on his personal X account , Hayes addressed speculation about the liquidation. ‚ÄúUS Tariff bill coming due in 3Q ‚Ä¶ at least the market believes that after NFP print. No major economy is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal GDP. So $BTC tests $100k, $ETH tests $3k,‚Äù he wrote. Y? US Tariff bill coming due in 3q ‚Ä¶ at least the mrkt believes that after NFP print. No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp. So $BTC tests $100k, $ETH tests $3k. Come see my @WebX_Asia Tokyo keynote Aug 25 for more info. Back to the beach. https://t.co/zuHlwgQKC7 ‚Äî Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) August 2, 2025 The reference to the U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which showed a sharp slowdown in job creation, with only 73,000 new jobs added in July. Hayes points to those underwhelming numbers as the reason for his concerns around waning economic momentum. In his view, the combination of weak labor market data and the expiration of U.S. tariff suspensions in Q3 signals a slowdown in credit creation that will weigh heavily on nominal GDP growth. Hayes argues that in such an environment, speculative assets like crypto will face significant pressure. Sell-off spurs market speculation In total, Lookonchain estimates Hayes sold 2,373 ETH, worth about $8.3 million, 7.76 million ENA valued at $4.6 million, and 38.86 billion PEPE, worth approximately $414,000. The speed and size of the transactions were seen as noteworthy, especially given the relatively low liquidity in altcoins like ENA and PEPE. However, not everyone believes the sales signal panic. Some analysts argue that the BitMEX co-founder is simply capitalizing on recent price rallies while preparing for potential downside risk amid macro turbulence. Hayes has promised to unpack his outlook in full during a keynote address at WebX Asia in Tokyo on August 25, one of the most anticipated conferences in the Asian crypto calendar. The timing of Hayes‚Äô market commentary is also crucial. Should the BitMEX co-founder‚Äôs macro predictions prove correct, traders may see a major correction before fresh capital enters the space, particularly from institutional investors. For now, his forecast points to the growing influence of macroeconomic policy on digital asset markets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-08-02 21:00:25,49440749,1754168425,"Analyst Spots XRP Final Wave, Says This Is Where Millionaires Are Made","Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has reignited bullish sentiment in the XRP community with a striking projection: XRP is entering its final and most explosive wave, a move that could turn disciplined holders into millionaires. Drawing from historical market cycles, technical indicators, and recent price action, the analyst argues that the long-anticipated breakout is now unfolding. XRP‚Äôs Multi-Year Setup Nearing Completion The chart shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO showcases XRP‚Äôs long-term trajectory, highlighting three key peaks: 2017, 2018, and 2024, with the final wave projected for 2025. Historically, XRP has shown a pattern of explosive rallies followed by extended consolidation. This current setup strongly resembles the 2017 cycle that propelled XRP to its all-time high. After years of stagnation due to legal uncertainty with the SEC, XRP has re-emerged with strength. The legal battle has largely been de-escalated following Ripple‚Äôs partial win in 2023 and further resolution in 2025. With regulatory fog clearing, investor confidence is returning, and XRP‚Äôs price is reflecting that optimism. The chart projects a steep move upward, suggesting the final leg of a multi-year cycle is about to unfold. The final wave for #XRP . This is where millionaires are made! pic.twitter.com/hIihL0pWdd ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 July 2025: Technical Breakout Confirmed XRP delivered a stellar performance in July 2025, beginning the month at approximately $2.24 and closing around $3.03‚Äîa 26% monthly gain. It reached a high of $3.55, a level not seen since January 2018. This marked XRP‚Äôs highest monthly close in history, finally surpassing the critical $3.03 resistance level that capped previous cycles. Midway through July, XRP briefly dipped to around $2.96 following a 10% correction. However, strong buying pressure quickly reversed the trend, with XRP rebounding to $3.11, forming higher lows and confirming bullish momentum. Analysts like Egrag Crypto had emphasized that a monthly close above $3.03 would open the floodgates to price discovery. That target has now been met. This milestone suggests XRP has officially entered a new phase‚Äîone where previous highs no longer define resistance, and new all-time highs are back in play. RSI Signals Impending Acceleration Further validating STEPH IS CRYPTO‚Äôs prediction is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the monthly timeframe. Currently at 72.20, XRP‚Äôs RSI is testing a long-term descending resistance line drawn from the 2017 and 2018 cycle tops. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A confirmed breakout above this RSI trendline would signal a massive shift in market momentum, similar to the setup before XRP‚Äôs previous parabolic run. The RSI structure adds significant weight to the analyst‚Äôs claim that XRP is entering its final, and potentially most lucrative, wave. Momentum Backed by Real-World Utility XRP‚Äôs bullish setup isn‚Äôt purely technical. Ripple continues to expand XRP‚Äôs utility across global payment corridors. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple‚Äôs U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, along with the XRPL EVM sidechain developed by Peersyst Technology, has introduced new use cases and enhanced interoperability with Ethereum-based ecosystems.

2025-08-02 21:00:10,49440747,1754168410,"The Market Tumbled, But ETH & BNB May Be Prepared To Pump‚ÄîShould You Secure Now?","The recent market dip has investors on edge, yet some signs suggest it may be a prime time to focus on specific cryptocurrencies. With Ethereum and Binance Coin showing potential for a strong recovery, the upcoming analysis explores whether these digital assets are poised to lead a reversal and why securing them now could be a strategic move. Ethereum Price Rally Meets Key Support and Resistance Levels Ethereum experienced a month of strong gains with a 37.35% increase and maintained a steady upward trend over the past six months with a 23.18% rise. A one-week decline of 5.09% shows short-term pullbacks amid overall positive momentum. Price fluctuations during these periods reveal a dynamic market where enthusiastic buying drove substantial monthly improvements, even as temporary corrections surfaced. The asset‚Äôs performance over these timeframes underscores a resilient market sentiment, with traders capitalizing on growing prices and adapting to brief dips in activity. Current prices hover between $2737.42 and $4302.16, setting the groundwork for active trades within well-defined ranges. An immediate resistance level at $4904.20 poses a barrier for bulls needing to push through for sustained upward movement, while a support level at $1774.72 has served as a reliable floor during fluctuations. The second-tier resistance at $6468.94 represents a key hurdle that could signal further climbs if breached, with a secondary support near $209.98 highlighting historical safety nets. Mixed signals from indicators show a market in balance, leading to cautious trading ideas that include buying near support and selling near resistance, while closely monitoring market indicators for strategy adjustments. BNB Market Evolution: Steady Growth Amid Key Price Barriers BNB recorded a monthly increase of about 16.61% and a six-month gain of roughly 24.65%. A one-week drop of 1.94% punctuated this upward trend, reflecting slight pullbacks amidst overall strength. The coin has managed intermittent corrections while maintaining an upward bias. Price history shows BNB‚Äôs ability to absorb short-term dips and continue its climb, suggesting a resilient market presence as reflected in recent changes and technical indicators. Currently, BNB trades within a range of approximately $664.60 to $881.30. The nearest resistance is around $979.60, with a secondary resistance at about $1,196.30. Support stands firm around $546.20, with a lower cushion near $329.50. The Awesome Oscillator is at 64.37, and an RSI reading of 55.64 signals a balanced state between bulls and bears. Traders are watching key levels closely, looking for buying opportunities near support and considering exits at resistance levels within this trading range. Conclusion ETH and BNB show potential for a strong rise soon. Market conditions suggest it could be a good time to consider getting in. Both coins have shown resilience and might be on the verge of a substantial increase. Careful analysis and timely decisions are crucial in taking advantage of this opportunity. The indicators point towards a favorable outlook for ETH and BNB despite recent downturns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-02 21:00:07,49440680,1754168407,Altcoin Rally To Commence When These 2 Signals Activate¬†‚Äì¬†Details,"The altseason fanfare remains on the rise despite a broad altcoin rally two weeks ago that has quickly evaporated in a wider market correction. As investors continue to await a potential rebound from these price dips, a popular analyst with X user PlanD has highlighted the two crucial signals that may initiate an altcoin market surge. Related Reading: Ethereum Drops 6% After Hitting $3,800, But Analysts See New ATH Ahead Ethereum And USDT Market Key To Altseason Future In an X post on August 1, PlanD shared an in-depth technical analysis of multiple markets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), and USDT Dominance. In studying the ETH market, PlanD highlights that the prominent altcoin faces major resistance at the $4,000, which has acted as the upper resistance level of a three-year symmetrical triangle. According to the presented analysis, Ethereum‚Äôs ability to effectively hold above the $4,000 price barrier is the first important developing situation for the altseason. Being the largest altcoin with a market cap of $424.48 billion, a successful breakout beyond this familiar price ceiling would encourage a rally by lower-cap alts to potentially initiate an altseason. Meanwhile, PlanD also draws attention to the USDT Dominance chart, which has just registered the breakout of a bearish flag. While there is potential to retest the breakout point at 4.71%, the analyst tells investors to monitor a potential fall to 3.81% which aligns with the breakout of a 1.5-year descending triangle and 3.21% i.e., the price target of the bearish flag. In particular, PlanD states a fall in USDT Dominance to 3.21% which suggests significant rotation of capital to other volatile assets is the ‚Äústrongest signal‚Äù for an altcoin rally. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Loses This Level, Expect A Major Crash: Analyst Warns BTC.D Potential Rise Possesses Risk To Altcoin Market In analyzing the Bitcoin Dominance chart, PlanD notes this metric has twice successfully retested a key support at a three-year rising wedge at 60.30%; therefore, there is intense potential for a rebound. The top analyst notes that if BTC.D rises to retest the pivotal market levels at 64.60% and 64.80%, the altcoin market may see a general price loss ranging from 10%-20%. Meanwhile, PlanD is also backing Bitcoin to maintain its bullish form in the coming weeks with a projected price target of $160,000. Interestingly, the trading expert notes that there are two paths to this price, noting that Bitcoin may first find support at the $113,000, propelling a rebound beyond $118,700 and an eventual surge to $160,000. Alternatively, Bitcoin‚Äôs present correction may halt around $108,000 before rising towards the specified bull target. In this case, altcoins may also witness an initial 10-20% widespread price decline.

2025-08-02 21:00:02,49440752,1754168402,Ripple moves over $2 billion XRP in a day; Incoming sell-off?,"Blockchain company Ripple moved 700 million XRP , valued at over $2 billion, on August 2 through a series of high-volume escrow transactions. The transfers occurred in three tranches, including 100 million XRP, 500 million XRP, and another 100 million XRP. Each was subsequently re-locked into escrow, according to on-chain data shared by blockchain tracker Whale Alert. These movements align with Ripple‚Äôs long-standing strategy to manage XRP‚Äôs circulating supply and form part of its broader monthly 1 billion XRP unlock process. Before the escrow actions, Whale Alert also flagged two separate transfers, 200 million and 300 million XRP, from unidentified wallets to Ripple, indicating internal repositioning likely tied to the monthly release mechanism. XRP escrow and whale transactions. Source: Whale Alert Ripple‚Äôs escrow system unlocks 1 billion XRP each month, typically re-locking between 700 million and 800 million XRP to manage supply. The 700 million XRP re-locked on August 2 suggests that around 300 million XRP was retained for potential use or distribution. Although Ripple maintains that its supply management minimizes market disruption, the consistent release of hundreds of millions of XRP outside escrow continues to raise concerns about short-term sell pressure. XRP price turns bearish Interestingly, XRP is already showing signs of bearish sentiment, with the token plunging sharply in the past 24 hours, mirroring broader market weakness. The asset has lost the critical $3 support zone, and analysts are warning of further downside amid large whale outflows. In line with this, on-chain data shared by Ali Martinez in an August 2 X post indicated that whales offloaded more than 710 million XRP in the past 24 hours. The spike in whale activity has reignited fears of short-term volatility, as such sell-offs often precede price drops. XRP whale transaction.

Source: Finbold Beyond broader market trends, XRP‚Äôs plunge also follows reports that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold $200 million in XRP over 10 days near the $3.84 peak. Meanwhile, the SEC has delayed decisions on Grayscale and Bitwise XRP ETF applications until at least September 2025, further dampening hopes for near-term institutional adoption.

2025-08-02 20:55:00,49440485,1754168100,Gate US Launches as American Crypto Skepticism Persists,"Gate US, the U.S. operation of global crypto exchange Gate Group, has officially launched spot trading for U.S. customers, the company revealed in an Aug. 1 press release . The Seychelles-based exchange, which facilitates up to $6.8 billion in daily trading volume, is initially offering crypto-to-crypto pairs, with fiat ramps and custodial wallets coming later this year. Gate Group founder, Dr. Lin Han, called the launch a ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù for the company‚Äôs global compliance strategy. But the move is made at a time when there remains tenuous public faith in crypto. Breaking Through America‚Äôs Crypto Skepticism The release timing is newsworthy in that it coincides with Gallup poll results where 95% of Americans are aware of cryptocurrency but just 35% report knowing what it is. More telling: 87% still see crypto as an investment asset, and 14% adoption rates are stuck, mostly among young, high-income men. This data places emphasis on the challenge for Gate US. Besides technology infrastructure and regulatory compliance, the exchange must overcome skepticism and confusion by the general public. Betting on Compliance and Local Integration Gate US is moving into an extremely regulated space with a compliance-driven and local integration approach. The company aims to win over tentative users and regulators by embedding U.S. financial institutions, adding fiat onramps, and offering secure custodial services. ‚ÄúWe are firmly convinced that the future of the crypto market is in vast integration with domestic markets,‚Äù Han explained. ‚ÄúGate Group is forging ahead towards an accepted global crypto service network‚Äîtechnology-centered and user-centric.‚Äù Education and Partnerships as Key Differentiators To address the knowledge gap revealed by Gallup, Gate US will spend on educational campaigns and talk to U.S.-based financial institutions. But as history shows, public education on crypto has been little short of futile, and the majority of Americans still prefer to avoid digital assets altogether. Competing in a Crowded and Wary Market Gate US is not alone in aiming for the American market. OKX returned in April following a massive settlement with the Department of Justice, and Binance.US is attempting to stage a return. They‚Äôre all aiming for a share of the $750 billion in U.S. crypto inflows that flowed last year, even though 60% of Americans don‚Äôt want to own digital assets. For Gate US, the real challenge is not gaining market share among existing traders but shifting the popular perception. As long as the general public perceives crypto as something more than a speculative bet, even the most compliant exchanges will struggle to achieve mass adoption.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,gate u operation global crypto exchange gate group officially launched spot trading customer company revealed press release exchange facilitates billion daily trading volume initially offering pair fiat ramp custodial wallet coming later year gate group founder lin han called launch milestone company global compliance strategy move made time remains tenuous public faith crypto breaking america crypto skepticism release timing newsworthy coincides gallup poll result american aware cryptocurrency report knowing telling still see crypto investment asset adoption rate stuck mostly among young men data place emphasis challenge gate u besides technology infrastructure regulatory compliance exchange must overcome skepticism confusion general public betting compliance local integration gate u moving extremely regulated space local integration approach company aim win tentative user regulator embedding financial institution adding fiat onramps offering secure custodial service firmly convinced future crypto market vast integration domestic market han explained gate group forging ahead towards accepted global crypto service education partnership key differentiator address knowledge gap revealed gallup gate u spend educational campaign talk financial institution history show public education crypto little short futile majority american still prefer avoid digital asset altogether competing crowded wary market gate u alone aiming american market okx returned april following massive settlement department justice attempting stage return aiming share billion crypto inflow flowed last year even though american want digital asset gate u real challenge gaining market share among existing trader shifting popular perception long general public perceives crypto something speculative bet even compliant exchange struggle achieve mass adoption,0.064,0.784,0.153,0.9647,1

2025-08-02 20:20:45,49439648,1754166045,U.S. companies are borrowing in Europe to access cheaper capital as the ECB cuts rates,"American companies are pushing into Europe this year to borrow at lower costs, putting less weight on the U.S. credit market. That‚Äôs based on reporting from Bloomberg, which shows a wave of euro-denominated bond deals from big U.S. names as they take advantage of lower interest rates across the Atlantic. This week, Verizon Communications Inc. sold ‚Ç¨2 billion (or $2.31 billion) worth of debt in Europe, its first bond deal there since early 2024. That followed July transactions by FedEx Corp. and PepsiCo Inc., which both returned to the euro market for the first time since 2021. These aren‚Äôt isolated. As of now, U.S. companies have raised ‚Ç¨116.3 billion (roughly $134 billion) in Europe. That‚Äôs just ‚Ç¨4.4 billion short of a full-year record, with five months still left in 2025. Companies target ECB‚Äôs lower rates while Fed holds back Some firms, like FedEx and PepsiCo, are refinancing maturing euro bonds. But overall issuance is higher because of one thing: the European Central Bank is already cutting rates, while the Federal Reserve hasn‚Äôt lowered a single one since December. ‚ÄúFrom an issuer‚Äôs point of view, it‚Äôs less expensive to borrow in euros,‚Äù said Gordon Shannon, portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management. The interest rate outlook in the U.S. has turned blurry. Job growth slowed sharply over the last three months, and the unemployment rate climbed, giving the Fed more space to start easing. U.S. Treasury yields dropped slightly after the labor data came out Friday, but they‚Äôre still near early July levels. That‚Äôs not enough of a dip to change the fact: Europe remains the cheaper place to borrow. For companies that hedge currency risk, this cost advantage might narrow soon, but right now, the savings are real. Foreign investors drop U.S. bonds as tariff tensions grow Hans Mikkelsen, U.S. credit strategist at TD Securities, said the trend is likely to stick around. With President Trump‚Äôs White House announcing new tariffs just this week, foreign investors have another reason to avoid U.S. corporate bonds. ‚ÄúThere will be less demand for U.S. corporate bonds and more demand for non-U.S. corporate bonds,‚Äù Hans said. ‚ÄúU.S. companies will have the same issuance needs. So they have to realize that they have to fund themselves more in other currencies.‚Äù The shift isn‚Äôt just one-sided. In July, U.S. companies issued $9 billion of euro debt, way above the average $3 billion for the month in the past three years. At the same time, European companies only borrowed a little over $2 billion in U.S. dollars, down sharply from their usual $13 billion monthly average. That imbalance is part of why U.S. dollar bond sales missed expectations in July. Wall Street dealers had forecast $100 billion in sales. Actual volume came in closer to $81 billion, Bloomberg data shows. That miss is directly tied to the rush into Europe and the pullback from overseas borrowers in the U.S. market. Still, the shift is helping U.S. bond valuations stay strong. For much of the past week, spreads on high-grade U.S. corporate bonds were at their tightest level of 2025, just 0.76 percentage points as of Thursday. That‚Äôs despite the pressures from economic uncertainty and foreign investor fatigue. The picture becomes clearer when looking at the overall supply. ‚ÄúIf you take this overarching trend of net supply being down, banks issuing less because of regulatory reform expectations as was the case this past quarter and more U.S. companies are issuing in Europe, all that does is further reinforce the positive technicals in the U.S. market,‚Äù said John Servidea, global co-head of investment-grade finance at JPMorgan Chase & Co. So far, every factor, from rate policy to global tariffs, is pushing American companies to turn to Europe for cheaper funding. Whether they‚Äôre refinancing old debt or meeting new funding needs, the euro bond market is where the money is right now.

2025-08-02 20:20:05,49439073,1754166005,Alleged Bitcoin Torture Suspect Freed on $1M Bail After 2 Months in Custody,"Crimes involving cryptocurrency are worryingly on the rise, becoming ever more aggressive and, as in this case, quite shocking. Regardless of whether alleged or not, this is the harsh reality we are currently facing in this day and age. Pleading Not Guilty According to a story from Fox News, two culprits are accused of torturing an Italian millionaire in his apartment in New York, reportedly over a stash of $100 million in Bitcoin, and one of them was released after spending two months in the Rikers Island prison. The discharged is John Woeltz, 37, on the condition of a $1 million parole, with the release coming a week after a Manhattan judge granted bond for him and an alleged accomplice, William Duplessie, aged 33. Both have pleaded not guilty, and the latter has remained in custody. The duo is accused of kidnapping and tormenting Italian crypto trader Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan. The defense attorneys on the case stated that the alleged torture very closely resembled a ‚Äúfraternity-like rite of passage.‚Äù Woeltz‚Äôs attorney, Wayne Gosnell, noted the following in a previous hearing: ‚ÄúMr. Carturan was there in the role of a pledge, he was essentially being hazed.‚Äù The alleged torturer, who was released and is also involved in cryptocurrency trading, evaded questions about whether he actually carried out the claims against him, and how he felt to be freed from custody as he was walking out of the Supreme Court building in Manhattan. As a condition to his release, the sum of which, reportedly, was a combination of cash and property put up by his father, he is subject to home arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet. He will only be allowed to leave the premises of his home for doctor‚Äôs appointments, meetings with lawyers, or in the event of an emergency. Violent and Graphic Prosecutors stated in court that the duo kidnapped Carturan and tortured him for over three weeks, supposedly relieving him of his phone and passport. The attorneys further note that both Duplessie and Woeltz reportedly had a manifesto prepared with how they plan to steal the prisoners‚Äô cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúInformant further states that the defendant and unapprehended male demanded that Informant provide the defendant with Informant‚Äôs wallet password so that the defendant and unapprehended male could take Informant‚Äôs Bitcoin,‚Äù a criminal complaint states. When the victim refused to provide the password to his crypto holdings, the two detainees allegedly subjected him to ‚Äúphysical beatings, in addition to, but not excluding, using electric shock, lacerating his head with blunt force from a firearm, and pointing said firearm at the Informant‚Äôs head several times. Further, the captive was dragged to the top of a flight of stairs, hanged over the ledge, and threatened with losing his life.‚Äù The authorities further added that there were threats against the 28-year-old hostage‚Äôs family in Italy, while he was, supposedly, humiliated by having people urinate on him and by Woeltz forcing him to take drugs. Both defendants are due to appear in court on October 15th.

2025-08-02 20:18:11,49438967,1754165891,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits Record High, Projected to Drop by 3% in August","The Bitcoin network mining difficulty reached an all-time high (ATH) of 127.6 trillion this week, representing increased competition for miners. The record may prove short-lived, however, as the difficulty is projected to decrease by around 3% to 123.7 trillion in the next adjustment on August 9, CoinWarz statistics indicate. This change in difficulty is in quick alignment with the average block time at 10 minutes and 20 seconds, slightly higher than the protocol target of 10 minutes. Why Mining Difficulty is Important Mining difficulty determines how difficult it is for the miners to come up with a valid hash for the next Bitcoin block. It is reset every 2,016 blocks to ensure new blocks around every 10 minutes regardless of the network‚Äôs amount of computing power (hashrate). A rising difficulty can strangle miner profitability, especially if Bitcoin‚Äôs price does not increase alongside. Conversely, a decline in difficulty gives miners temporary respite since rewards become easier to obtain with the same hardware. Hashrate and Difficulty: A Balancing Act Hashrate ‚Äî i.e., aggregate computing power keeping the Bitcoin network secure ‚Äî is strongly correlated with difficulty. When additional miners join, difficulty increases to maintain block time consistency. Difficulty decreases when miners leave in order to avoid production slowdown. After its drop to 116.9 trillion in early July, the difficulty kept moving along in late July, consistent with rising hashrate levels. Stock-to-Flow and Bitcoin‚Äôs Scarcity The stock-to-flow ratio of Bitcoin lies at its core. Bitcoin, with 94% of all BTC having been mined, enjoys a stock-to-flow ratio of approximately 120, which is twice gold with its ratio of 60. Scarcity through controlled issuance is the antidote to price volatility caused by oversupply. Difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures price inelasticity to production, a feature that makes Bitcoin structurally different from most commodities. Conclusion While the Bitcoin mining difficulty lately hit a record high, the projected August dip gives miners temporary respite. In the long term, the adjustment mechanism remains central to sustaining the fixed issuance schedule of Bitcoin, upholding its scarcity, and enhancing its store of value status as a deflationary digital currency.",Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,bitcoin network mining difficulty reached high ath trillion week representing increased competition miner record may prove however difficulty projected decrease around trillion next adjustment august coinwarz statistic indicate change difficulty quick alignment average block time minute second slightly higher protocol target minute mining difficulty important mining difficulty determines difficult miner come valid hash next bitcoin block reset every block ensure new block around every minute regardless network amount computing power hashrate rising difficulty strangle miner profitability especially bitcoin price increase alongside conversely decline difficulty give miner temporary respite since reward become easier obtain hardware hashrate difficulty balancing act hashrate aggregate computing power keeping bitcoin network secure strongly correlated difficulty additional miner join difficulty increase maintain block time consistency difficulty decrease miner leave order avoid production slowdown drop trillion early july difficulty kept moving along late july consistent rising hashrate level bitcoin scarcity ratio bitcoin lie core bitcoin btc mined enjoys ratio approximately twice gold ratio scarcity controlled issuance antidote price volatility caused oversupply difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures price inelasticity production feature make bitcoin structurally different commodity conclusion bitcoin mining difficulty lately hit record high projected august dip give miner temporary respite long term adjustment mechanism remains central sustaining fixed issuance schedule bitcoin upholding scarcity enhancing store value status deflationary digital currency,0.218,0.653,0.128,-0.9627,0

Arkham's analysis of on-chain data revealed that 127,426 BTC were stolen from a China-based mining pool called LuBian in December 2020. This amount was worth approximately $3.5 billion at the time, and its current value is approximately $14.5 billion. LuBian was a large mining pool with facilities in China and Iran that controlled approximately 6% of the global Bitcoin network as of 2020.

In the following days, approximately $6 million worth of BTC and USDT was stolen from a LuBian address active on the Bitcoin Omni layer on December 29. On December 31, LuBian moved his remaining assets to recovery wallets. Related News: Market Prophet Tom Lee Shares His Bullish Prediction on Ethereum (ETH) Price Neither LuBian nor the hacker has publicly acknowledged the incident to date, so Arkham's research marks the first documented case of this massive attack. Following the attack, LuBian sent OP_RETURN messages to the hacker addresses, demanding the return of the stolen BTC. These messages were transmitted in 1,516 separate transactions, totaling 1.4 BTC. Experts believe this intensive effort undermines claims that another hacker obtained the private keys through brute-force. Research indicates that LuBian used weak algorithms in private key generation, which may have paved the way for the attack. LuBian managed to preserve the remaining 11,886 BTC (currently worth approximately $1.35 billion) from the attack. However, the 127,426 stolen BTC remain under the hacker's control. The last movement of these wallets was recorded as a consolidation transaction in July 2024. The LuBian attack, with a volume of $3.5 billion at the time of the transfer, became the largest cryptocurrency theft ever recorded. Today, the attacker holds $14.5 billion in BTC, making him the 13th largest Bitcoin holder in the world, according to Arkham data, ahead of even the Mt. Gox hacker. *This is not investment advice.

In an interview on the RiskReversal Media YouTube channel, Kelly says Bitcoin could explode by around 600% from the current level if the crypto king reaches the current market cap of gold. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say all you do is use it [Bitcoin] as a substitute for gold. That‚Äôs one use case among many others‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and it takes over gold. I think the market cap of gold right now is somewhere around $15 trillion‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and Bitcoin is at what? $2.5 trillion.

So, that‚Äôs not bad.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading at $115,580 at time of writing, down by around 6% from the all-time high reached in mid-July.

That‚Äôs money mined on April 26, 2010, during Bitcoin‚Äôs earliest tests. Traders saw the shift and paused, wondering if a massive sell-off was coming after more than 15 years of silence. Related Reading: XRP ETF Approval Incoming? Analyst Eyes September-October Window Early Coins Stir According to on-chain observers, these coins came from wallets active before the famous ‚ÄúPatoshi pattern‚Äù ended. That pattern, often linked to Bitcoin‚Äôs creator, slowed down around May 2010. Moving coins from that era can send a jolt through the market, even when the total is small. Around 250 BTC made a splash in today‚Äôs headlines. Yet Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply tops 19 million coins. So far, none of the funds have shown up on public exchanges. That means any real impact on prices may be low‚Äîunless the coins suddenly head for the exit in bulk. 5 miner wallets woke up after being dormant for over 15 years and transferred 250 $BTC($29.6M) out an hour ago. These miner wallets earned 50 $BTC each from mining on Apr 26, 2010.

If those wallets start funneling coins into exchanges or over-the-counter desks, panic could spread. But wallet shuffles without selling are common among early miners who just want to consolidate or upgrade their security. Clues Point Away From Satoshi Based on reports from Whale Alert, these movements don‚Äôt match the nonce patterns tied to the roughly 1.12 million BTC once mined by ‚ÄúSatoshi Nakamoto‚Äù across blocks up to number 54,316. Experts note the mining speed and nonce range differ from what‚Äôs been linked to Bitcoin‚Äôs creator. That makes it far more likely these funds belong to other early adopters. Tightening Crypto Rules Meanwhile, reports have disclosed that Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency (FSA) has moved oversight of crypto-asset exchanges into a more powerful unit. The aim is to tighten rules, improve capital checks, and guard against money-laundering. This change brings crypto platforms under the same kind of scrutiny as banks and brokerages.

2025-08-02 20:00:35,49438320,1754164835,Donald Trump Receives Over $26M in Crypto Donations In 7 Months,"New campaign finance records have shown that the crypto industry has donated more than $26 million to support U.S. President Donald Trump this year. The donations were made to MAGA Inc., a political action committee that backs the country leader. These contributions come from some of the most well-known names in the crypto industry . This move reflects the growing relationship between President Trump and the crypto sector. Industry Leaders Back Trump‚Äôs Campaign According to a recent report, several major crypto companies and investors made large financial contributions to Trump‚Äôs 2024 presidential campaign. This financial support suggests that many in the industry believe the president will create an environment that allows digital assets to grow with fewer restrictions. Not surprising, since Trump returned to office this year, he has taken several actions in support of cryptocurrencies. Not too long ago, he signed the GENIUS Act into law , which is the first federal legislation that focuses on stablecoins. His administration is also working to pass the CLARITY Act, a proposed law that would create a clear legal framework for digital assets. The U.S. president has reaffirmed commitment to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . He released a detailed report outlining policies to support open-source crypto projects and protect user privacy. These steps have been praised by many leaders in the digital finance space, who view them as signs of strong support for innovation. Critic Raises Concerns About Personal Interests However, Trump‚Äôs growing involvement in the crypto industry has raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest . Members of his family are involved in several crypto ventures. This includes stablecoins, memecoins, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Bitcoin mining. Critics worry that the president could benefit personally from decisions made by his administration. This is especially if those decisions affect markets in which he or his relatives have investments. Some are also questioning Trump‚Äôs personal connection to digital assets, with reports saying a big part of his wealth is tied to crypto . His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group is estimated to be worth over $2 billion. Also, his broader crypto investments are believed to have gained over $600 million in recent months. Crypto Investments Within the Trump Administrative Cabinet The concerns do not stop with Trump alone. A number of officials and nominees in his administration also have significant investments in digital assets. Reports say that nearly 70 people in Trump‚Äôs administration have some kind of crypto investment, with amounts ranging from small sums to over $120 million. This group includes Vice President JD Vance and several top government officials. Some worry that these investments could influence policy decisions. Others think it sets a bad example by encouraging public officials to invest in risky assets.

2025-08-02 20:00:28,49438768,1754164828,"Florida added over 3GW of utility-scale solar in one year, surpassing California","Florida just passed California in new solar installations, adding over 3 gigawatts of utility-scale solar in one year. This marks the first time Florida has outpaced longtime leaders like Texas and California in solar capacity growth. It happened in a state that, as of 2024, removed climate change from its official state policy. ‚ÄúThis is not a fluke,‚Äù said Sylvia Leyva Martinez, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ‚ÄúFlorida is now shaping national solar growth.‚Äù The push came almost entirely from utilities. Florida Power & Light alone built more than 70% of the new solar infrastructure in the state last year. Florida skips red tape as utilities drive solar growth Developers in Florida don‚Äôt face full siting reviews for projects under 75 megawatts. That‚Äôs the result of a state-level rule that makes it easier and faster to build large-scale solar. It means lower costs and shorter construction timelines. That‚Äôs how the state added more solar than California last year ‚Äî without relying on rooftop panels. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no silver bullet,‚Äù said Syd Kitson, who created Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be almost fully solar-powered. ‚ÄúBut one thing Florida got right is acceptance. Here, people want solar. And we‚Äôre proving it works.‚Äù Babcock Ranch runs on its own microgrid, separate from the state‚Äôs big power grid. It stayed online during Hurricane Ian in 2022, even as large parts of southwest Florida lost power. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt lose power, internet, or water,‚Äù said Don Bishop, a resident. ‚ÄúThat changes how you think about energy.‚Äù Natural gas prices are rising. Demand from industry is going up. For utilities, that means solar is now cheaper ‚Äî even without subsidies. ‚ÄúUtilities aren‚Äôt building solar because it‚Äôs green,‚Äù said Martinez. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing it because it‚Äôs cheaper.‚Äù But the picture isn‚Äôt all positive. In July, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill, a law that rolls back federal tax credits for solar and wind. Homeowners lose the federal investment credit after 2025. For developers, project deadlines are tighter and sourcing rules are stricter. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt kill the market,‚Äù said Zo√´ Gaston, another Wood Mackenzie analyst. ‚ÄúBut it makes the math harder.‚Äù Rooftop solar in Florida is expected to drop by 42% in the next five years. That‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô forecast. Utility-scale growth is still going, but now grid constraints are showing up. Power companies are now investing heavily in storage, smart grid tech, and system upgrades to stay ahead of demand. At Babcock Ranch, engineers are testing new microgrid models that can be rolled out to other neighborhoods. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been testing this for years,‚Äù said Kitson. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs about scale. It‚Äôs about showing others they can do it too.‚Äù Still, the state is not moving away from natural gas anytime soon. And without clear political direction, some experts say Florida‚Äôs momentum may not last. ‚ÄúFlorida has the solar resources,‚Äù said Mark Jacobson, an engineering professor at Stanford University. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing is political consistency.‚Äù Get seen where it counts.

2025-08-02 20:00:16,49438319,1754164816,BlockDAG Surges With 200K Holders and 2.5M X1 App Users While SEI & ATOM Struggle for Direction,"Crypto markets are seeing tug-of-war movements. Cosmos (ATOM) has gained 4%, now trading above $4.84, supported by a 1.2M volume spike that may push the price toward $5 if Bitcoin strength holds. SEI, on the other hand, is showing weakness. Its price prediction points to a 4% decline below $0.31, as sellers dominate the recent choppy trading zone. While many wait for market confirmation, BlockDAG (BDAG) isn‚Äôt holding back. Over 2.5 million users are already mining via the X1 app, and 200,000+ holders are secured before any listing. With more than $358 million raised in presale and adoption growing daily, it‚Äôs not just speculation but real traction setting the tone. Unlike Cosmos and SEI, which rely on market momentum, BlockDAG‚Äôs story is powered by actual usage and strong community backing. Cosmos (ATOM) Price Action: 4% Rise Driven by Strong Volume ATOM has shown a notable price increase in the last 24 hours, climbing from $4.78 to $4.89. This upward Cosmos (ATOM) price action was supported by a clean breakout above $4.84 resistance, fueled by volume exceeding 1.2 million during peak trading times. Some market observers suggest that if Bitcoin continues its upward push past $124,000, altcoins like Cosmos may benefit with further price appreciation. For now, Cosmos is showing promising movement, giving bulls room to aim for the $5 mark and above. SEI Price Prediction: Another 4% Drop Possible SEI is struggling again under pressure. It recently dropped by 5.5%, currently hovering around the lower boundary of its recent three-week range between $0.317 and $0.37. As of now, the SEI price prediction warns of another 4% drop if it slips below the key $0.31 support zone. Despite this, some short-term traders still believe SEI might bounce back if that $0.31 level holds. A bullish block exists near that area, potentially attracting quick trades, but much of this depends on whether Bitcoin can hold its ground without sparking a broader correction. BlockDAG‚Äôs Growth Surges With 200K Holders and 2.5M X1 App Users BlockDAG is witnessing heavy momentum even before going live on exchanges. The X1 mobile miner app has crossed 2.5 million users actively mining, and over 200,000 holders have already claimed their position. This strong wave of early traction is shaping up into one of the most aggressive adoption runs seen this year. So far, BlockDAG‚Äôs presale has collected over $358 million, with 24.6 billion BDAG coins sold across 28 completed batches. Early supporters have already seen their funds grow by 2,660% since batch 1. The current price in batch 29 sits at $0.0016, available until August 11. With a forecasted launch price of $0.05, that‚Äôs a 3,025% potential return locked in for those buying now. Speculation hints at long-term price targets of $1, $10, or possibly $20 based on rising demand and shrinking coin availability. While opinions vary, the path to those figures begins with this presale window, not after listings inflate the entry price. BlockDAG‚Äôs adoption surge is backed by action, not hope. The user base continues to grow as more people engage with the network before trading even begins. This level of usage makes BlockDAG stand out among new launches. The Beat Vesting Pass offer has also been extended until August 4, further boosting buyer interest. With millions already mining and thousands holding, this momentum suggests the project is entering the market with a stronger footing than most. Those moving now are securing a position in one of the top cryptos to buy today, while delays could result in missed price windows and lost gains. Final Say! Price activity in the market paints different pictures. Cosmos (ATOM) price action reflects a stable gain, with buyers showing confidence above $4.84 and strong volume backing it. SEI price prediction, meanwhile, remains uncertain with chances of a 4% dip unless the $0.31 level holds. BlockDAG is showing a different kind of strength. With over 2.5 million active mobile miners, 200,000 holders, and $358 million raised before its market debut, adoption is already taking place. Many believe BlockDAG could be the best crypto for higher returns , offering a 3,025% jump by launch, driven by massive community activity and a rapidly closing presale phase. Those eyeing the next breakout altcoin are starting to count BlockDAG among the top cryptos to buy today. The current numbers and user growth support this belief, putting BDAG on track for big performance as 2025 continues.

2025-08-02 20:00:12,49438214,1754164812,Every Trader Must Stack These Tokens In Their Digital Portfolio For The Incoming Surge,"As digital assets gain momentum, certain tokens show signs of a promising rise. Savvy traders eye these potential growth opportunities, ready to enhance their portfolios. The upcoming article delves into which cryptocurrencies might be poised for impressive gains, providing insights into top picks that could lead the charge in the next market surge. Hyperliquid Market Performance and Key Levels Analysis Over the last month, Hyperliquid showed a moderate decline with a 1-week drop of 13.58% and a 1-month decrease of 4.24%. Over the past six months, the coin displayed strong upward momentum with a gain of 70.92%. Price fluctuations and recovery efforts have been evident as the coin moved through correction phases and short-term pressures, while broader gains suggest growing investor interest and possible accumulation among strategic buyers. The coin is currently trading in a range from $35.17 to $48.23. Nearest resistance is observed at $55.58, with support found at $29.46. Additionally, a second resistance at $68.64 and a second support at $16.40 provide clear markers for cautionary trading. Short-term indicators such as an Awesome Oscillator of -1.690 and a Momentum Indicator of -5.554, along with an RSI of 37.87, indicate that bearish activity is presently influential. The market does not display a defined trend, making tactical trades appealing within these levels. Traders may consider buying cautiously near support levels and look to take profits near immediate resistance while watching for any breakout or reversal signals to refine entry and exit decisions. Celestia (TIA): Past Trends and Key Levels in Focus TIA has managed a modest recovery over the last month with a 3.96% gain, contrasting sharply with a challenging half-year performance marked by a 50.10% drop. A one-week decline of 15.26% adds to a mixed history, highlighting volatility in the short term. Price movements reflect periods of rapid rebound interspersed with significant corrections, suggesting that market sentiment has swung widely. Traders have witnessed fluctuations indicating both opportunities and risks, particularly as price actions have reversed swiftly. These patterns reveal a market that has experienced both brief positive momentum and deeper declines over an extended period. Currently, the coin trades within a price range of $1.25 to $2.20. A resistance level at $2.72 may prove a barrier for upward moves, while a support level around $0.82 offers a safety net during dips. A second resistance level at $3.66 presents another ceiling to watch. The Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.064, and the Momentum Indicator stands at -0.292, indicating bears have the upper hand. The Relative Strength Index at 40.80 is near oversold territory but lacks a clear upward trend. A trading approach focused on the bounce from support while monitoring resistance near $2.72 could effectively manage risk and capture potential short-term recoveries in a cautious market. Toncoin Price Action: Mixed Trends with Recent Gains Toncoin posted a clear surge over the past month with a nearly 29% gain, while the six-month performance shows an 8.94% decline. The coin has experienced strong short-term rallies that lifted prices rapidly, contrasting with setbacks noted over a longer horizon. Recent weekly performance, which pushed prices up by nearly 16%, suggests that buyers were active, even though longer-term trends remain mixed. Data points indicate a dynamic yet volatile behavior, with shifts in momentum that keep traders on their toes. The current price ranges between $2.93 and $3.90, with a notable resistance marking at $4.28 and a secondary resistance at $5.25. A support level stands firmly at $2.34, backed by a second support at $1.36. Bulls have shown their force in the short term, pushing the price up as seen in the one-week and one-month gains; however, a high Relative Strength Index around 72 signals caution as the asset may be overbought.

2025-08-02 20:00:00,49439500,1754164800,DOGE targets $0.80 but newer tokens are attracting long-term whales,"Dogecoin is once more making waves in the crypto space. While DOGE is eyeing a target of $0.80, investors are questioning whether the meme-based surge can resist growing competition from emerging endeavors. One such entrant is Remittix (RTX) ‚Äî an endeavor conceptualized with real-world payment solutions in perspective. DOGE price struggles as whales explore other options Dogecoin is now $0.2060, down by a 4.94% decline over the last 24 hours. In spite of that, trading has surged to $3.06 billion, which is more than 53% higher, indicating that there remains plenty of interest surrounding the coin. DOGE boasts a market cap of nearly $31 billion and is among the biggest meme coins to ever exist. Still, its price still largely relies on social opinion and speculative trading rather than fundamentals in good DeFi projects. Even while the broader market trends towards crypto that actually has utility, long-term whales still go looking for early-stage crypto investment opportunities in payments, cross-border finance, and low gas fee crypto infrastructure. Remittix wallet launch and utility: a payment game-changer Remittix (RTX) is making a serious play at disrupting global payments. The team recently announced its beta wallet, with a Q3 2025 launch on the cards. The wallet will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, with real-time FX conversion, low gas fees, and user-friendly interface on mobile. At its core, Remittix solves a basic but massive issue ‚Äî making crypto into usable money in the physical world. It will enable individuals to send cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and USDT directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries immediately, which makes it ideal for freelancers, remote employees, remitters, and companies. With a price currently standing at $0.0895, the RTX token has already raked in more than $17.9 million in its best crypto presale 2025, selling more than 576 million tokens. The project is now within reach of its $18M soft cap, with an active 50% token bonus for early adopters. Why Remittix is gathering steam with utility-driven investors While DOGE fails to find new purpose, Remittix is finding its footing in the real-world payment market ‚Äî a $190 trillion opportunity ripe for blockchain disruption. Here‚Äôs why RTX is being considered one of the best DeFi projects 2025: Global Reach: On-demand crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Low Gas Fees: Built with speed and affordability in mind Beta Wallet Launch Q3: Real product, real roadmap $250, 00 Giveaway: Building the community and hype 50% Token Bonus: Timelimited offer before soft cap reaches With more attention from institutional and retail investors, Remittix is being touted as a new crypto token play that really delivers on usability.

2025-08-02 20:00:00,49438766,1754164800,"Dogecoin (DOGE) Wallet Surge Draws Headlines, But Could This $0.035 DeFi Gem Be the Smarter Summer Buy?","The recent spike in Dogecoin (DOGE) wallet addresses is grabbing headlines across the crypto world. While the meme coin remains a favorite of social media-driven speculation, many are beginning to question whether hype alone is enough in 2025‚Äôs maturing market. Meme tokens have seen massive attention in the past, but without deep utility, long-term sustainability remains in doubt. In contrast, one DeFi protocol currently in presale‚Äî Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äîis presenting a sharply different proposition: a functional, scalable, and income-generating ecosystem that rewards both lenders and borrowers with real-world utility. At just $0.035 in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the summer‚Äôs sleeper pick, offering far more than digital clout or viral momentum. Investors are beginning to take notice of its lending model, passive income structure, and tokenized system‚Äîall supported by a solid smart contract foundation and an ecosystem that is about to go live. DOGE Wallet Surge Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a remarkable surge in wallet activity, with over 29,000 new wallets created since early July 2025, per Santiment data, reflecting heightened community interest. On-chain metrics show a 400% spike in whale transactions, with 800 million DOGE accumulated in 48 hours, as reported on X. This follows Bit Origin‚Äôs $500 million DOGE treasury allocation, boosting institutional confidence. DOGE‚Äôs price, at ~$0.22, is down 7.89% weekly but up 39% monthly, per CoinMarketCap, with trading volume steady at $1.95 billion. The MyDoge wallet‚Äôs DogeOS proposal for zero-knowledge proofs aims to enhance utility, while ETF approval odds at 80% fuel optimism. However, a neutral RSI (~59) and heavy sell-off pressure (5B DOGE to exchanges) suggest volatility. Sustained wallet growth and bullish sentiment could push DOGE toward $0.32. Real Returns Backed by Assets, Not Memes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a lending protocol around real asset utility. Unlike meme coins that rely entirely on social buzz, MUTM‚Äôs protocol enables users to lend blue-chip assets like USDT, ADA, SOL, and LINK to decentralized pools and earn variable interest. These deposits are used to fund overcollateralized loans‚Äîwhere borrowers lock crypto like ETH or BNB to access liquidity. These loans are automatically managed by smart contracts, ensuring a non-custodial, transparent system. For example, lending $20,000 in USDT at a 15% APY would generate a passive income of $3,000 per year, without needing to trade or speculate. This interest is earned dynamically, as pool utilization rates adjust based on borrowing activity, giving lenders both flexibility and strong returns. All lending is facilitated via the protocol‚Äôs mtToken model‚Äîwhere lenders receive mtTokens representing their deposit plus interest. These mtTokens grow in value over time and can be held or staked for further MUTM rewards. On the borrowing side, users can unlock liquidity without selling their core assets. By posting overcollateralized tokens like ETH, they receive stablecoin loans while keeping price exposure‚Äîsolving a major issue for long-term holders in need of capital. What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) even more inclusive is its Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending system. Through this, users can directly negotiate terms and lend to or borrow against higher-risk tokens‚Äîincluding meme coins like DOGE and SHIB‚Äîwithout compromising the core risk-managed pool. This dual structure of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and P2P lending allows the platform to stay stable while expanding accessibility for a wider user base. Smart Contract Safety, Upcoming Beta, and 285x Early Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed through manual and automated smart contract testing with a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty now live. CertiK‚Äôs review delivered strong scores‚Äî95.00 Token Scan and 78.00 Skynet‚Äîoffering added confidence as the beta release is scheduled to coincide with the token‚Äôs listing. The project‚Äôs presale is currently in Phase 6, priced at $0.035, with over 7% of the 170 million Phase 6 tokens already taken. A 15% price jump is confirmed for Phase 7, where the token will rise to $0.040. At the final listing price of $0.06, Phase 1 investors‚Äîwho bought in at just $0.01‚Äîare already sitting on 180% gains, with projections estimating up to 285x returns if the token reaches the anticipated $3‚Äì$10 range post-CEX launch. The project has already attracted over 14,700 holders, while its social following now exceeds 12,000 followers on Twitter, with more investors joining daily. A $100,000 giveaway is also live, where 10 winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, further enhancing user engagement during presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing to launch on a Layer-2 blockchain, allowing for faster transactions and lower gas fees‚Äîa critical move for scaling its lending pools, stablecoin functions, and future integrations. While Dogecoin‚Äôs popularity continues to create noise, utility-focused investors are increasingly turning to tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äîwhere every smart contract and token mechanism is built for function, not fiction. With stablecoin lending, flexible borrowing, passive dividends, and protocol-level buybacks on the roadmap, this $0.035 DeFi gem looks set to become a far more strategic buy this summer.

2025-08-02 19:35:23,49437843,1754163323,"OPEC+ plans to increase oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in September","OPEC+ has reached a preliminary agreement to raise oil production by 548,000 barrels per day starting in September, according to Bloomberg. The plan is expected to be formally approved when the alliance meets virtually on Sunday. This increase is the final piece in reversing the 2.2 million bpd cut that eight of its members had implemented last year. It also includes an additional production bump specifically for the United Arab Emirates, which is getting phased in separately. The decision marks the continuation of OPEC‚Äôs clear pivot away from supporting prices to pumping more barrels into a market still digesting economic shocks and political pressure. This follows a string of aggressive supply increases that began back in April, right after President Donald Trump triggered market volatility with his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù trade tariff push. Oil futures had dropped to their lowest levels in four years following that announcement, and OPEC+ responded by speeding up its existing timeline to unwind cuts. Accelerated production reversal deepens global supply concerns By July, the group had already advanced its monthly production hikes, and now this planned 548,000 bpd addition for September will fully undo last year‚Äôs supply cut. But even as this round gets wrapped up, markets are already eyeing the next wave of withheld oil. There‚Äôs still 1.66 million bpd of output that remains formally shut in until the end of 2026, and traders are betting that could be brought back earlier if current trends hold. For now, more oil is on the way. And the consequences are being felt. On Friday, Brent crude dropped $2.03 to $69.67 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate fell $1.93 to $67.33, as fears of additional supply combined with weak U.S. economic data. That data came from the Labor Department, which reported the country only added 73,000 jobs in July, well below expectations. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. These numbers rattled investors already worried about softening demand. Despite the price drop, oil still gained for the week. Brent finished up nearly 6%, and WTI climbed 6.29%, thanks to strong summer demand. But that might not last long. Analysts are already warning about the possibility of a global surplus later this year. More barrels from OPEC+, combined with cooling economies, could tip the market back into oversupply. Gas prices are already falling. Benchmark retail gasoline prices in the U.S. dipped in July, and this fresh OPEC+ move could keep them sliding. That‚Äôs a short-term win for consumers, and politically convenient for Trump, who‚Äôs been hammering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Russia and Saudi Arabia reinforce OPEC+ alliance amid tensions At the same time, Trump‚Äôs team is threatening to impose secondary sanctions on any country that continues to import Russian crude unless there‚Äôs a ceasefire in Ukraine. That threat could disrupt flows and push prices back up, the exact opposite of Trump‚Äôs goal to keep energy costs down. To avoid fractures inside OPEC+, Russia‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak made a rare trip to Riyadh on Thursday, where he met with Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. The two discussed energy cooperation between their countries, reinforcing their leadership within the nearly decade-old alliance. That partnership will be key as OPEC+ navigates the next phase of production policy. While three people with direct knowledge of the group‚Äôs internal talks said the 548,000 bpd figure is likely to be locked in this weekend, one person said the final volume is still being debated and could end up slightly lower. What‚Äôs clear is that OPEC is moving quickly. After years of defending prices, the group is now focused on reclaiming market share, even if that risks another supply glut. With demand looking shaky and politics heating up, the next few months could decide how long this aggressive production strategy holds.

But while XLM price sentiment turns cautiously optimistic, a stealth ISO-20022 contender is quietly gaining serious traction. Remittix (RTX) is being dubbed the real game-changer for cross-border payments, and some believe it could outpace Stellar‚Äôs rally entirely. Here‚Äôs why investors are watching both, but betting bigger on one. Can XLM price prediction still reach $1.50? Despite recent volatility, XLM price today sits at a pivotal turning point. Stellar dipped over 5% in the last 24 hours, reflecting broader market softness. Yet behind the scenes, things are shifting. Stellar news just dropped a bombshell‚ÄîVisa has officially added Stellar to its stablecoin settlement platform, joining Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This is no minor update. It‚Äôs a clear signal that Visa sees Stellar price potential beyond just speculation. With its low-cost, high-speed design, Stellar is now a preferred rail for institutional settlements. That puts XLM news ahead of XRP, which remains excluded from Visa‚Äôs latest rollout. And in the eyes of traders, this changes the game. Analyst Ali Martinez spotted a bullish flag forming, often a sign of incoming momentum. If it breaks, XLM price prediction could aim for $0.80, with some whispering about $1.50 if institutional use deepens. This isn‚Äôt just about hype anymore. It‚Äôs about positioning. Remittix may outpace Stellar in real adoption While Stellar price prediction circles $1.50, a lesser-known ISO-20022 contender is quietly gaining speed. Remittix (RTX) doesn‚Äôt try to imitate legacy systems‚Äîit replaces them. The platform strips away the red tape of global finance and replaces it with instant crypto-to-fiat payments that settle straight to bank accounts. No delays. No nonsense. Unlike Stellar (XLM), which still relies heavily on partnerships for momentum, Remittix builds from the ground up. It supports over 30 fiat currencies, works with 50+ crypto pairs, and skips the need for centralized exchanges or hidden conversion fees. Its real value? Simplicity. Analysts now label it a stealth ISO-20022 play‚Äîone that banks on utility, not promises. The $17.9 million already raised reflects that investors are paying attention. Token demand surged past 578 million units at a base price of $0.0895, and whales are now eyeing its beta wallet launch on September 15, 2025. Here‚Äôs why Remittix is gaining steam fast: Works with crypto and fiat, no middlemen involved Avoids delays with direct-to-bank settlement Maintains flat, transparent fees unlike banks Launches beta wallet product in September 2025 The crypto market often rewards flash. But Remittix is winning over smart money with function. While XLM news highlights another big-name partnership, Remittix quietly solves what people actually care about‚Äîgetting paid. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs being called the best crypto under $1 that nobody sees coming.

Now, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is on track to deliver the next big success story. Since its CoinMarketCap (CMC) debut, Ruvi AI has stunned the market with jaw-dropping presale numbers, selling over 1 million tokens daily and achieving 70% completion of its Phase 2 presale. With an impending 33% price increase slated to push token costs from $0.015 to $0.020, Ruvi AI is pacing toward massive growth potential. Analysts are already dubbing it the next Solana, forecasting a $1 valuation that could generate life-changing returns for early investors. How the CoinMarketCap Listing Changed the Game Being listed on CoinMarketCap isn‚Äôt just a badge of credibility, it‚Äôs a gateway to visibility in the world of crypto. For Ruvi AI, the CMC spotlight provided a significant boost, opening the floodgates to crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors. This transformation didn‚Äôt just drive momentum; it established Ruvi AI as one of the fastest-selling tokens in 2025. By the Numbers: 70% of Phase 2 sold out: Over 210 million tokens have already been purchased. 1 million tokens sold daily: A metric that showcases investor demand unlike anything seen before. $2.6 million raised so far: Cementing Ruvi AI‚Äôs record-breaking presale momentum. With Phase 2 nearing completion, the subsequent 33% price increase will set the stage for even greater interest as the token price moves to $0.020. Why Ruvi AI Could Follow Solana‚Äôs Path Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt just another altcoin, it‚Äôs a project brimming with real-world applications, AI-driven innovation, and scalability. These features set it apart in today‚Äôs crypto market, where utility matters more than hype. For investors who watched Solana rise, Ruvi AI represents a golden opportunity to capitalize early on the next blockchain sensation. Key Features That Set Ruvi AI Apart 1. AI-Powered Solutions for Businesses Ruvi AI goes beyond speculative value by offering AI-driven tools that help businesses optimize marketing efforts, boost efficiency, and lower costs. These solutions integrate seamlessly with blockchain, providing transparency and real-world impact. 2. Transparent and Secure Payments for Creators Ruvi AI addresses a massive gap in the gig economy by creating fraud-proof, instantaneous payment systems for freelancers and digital creators. Unlike many altcoins, Ruvi AI solves a concrete problem, bringing the blockchain closer to practical everyday use. 3. Multi-Industry Compatibility While Solana is best known for its speed, Ruvi AI‚Äôs versatility is driving adoption in fields like education, healthcare, and finance. Its adaptable platform ensures a long-term growth trajectory far beyond the current presale buzz. By combining utility with innovation, Ruvi AI positions itself as a smart, scalable, and profitable contender that could rival Solana‚Äôs upward climb to dominance. Exclusive VIP Bonuses for Early Participants For those who want to maximize their holdings, Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP tier system offers unmatched rewards. Here‚Äôs how early investors can enhance their ROI: VIP 2: A $750 investment earns investors 50,000 RUVI tokens at $0.015 each, plus a 40% bonus, totaling 70,000 tokens. At $0.070 (the confirmed listing price), this equals $4,900, and if the tokens hit $1, this equals $70,000, a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3: A higher-tier contribution of $1,500 secures 100,000 tokens plus a 60% bonus, adding 60,000 tokens for a total of 160,000. If the token reaches $1, this investment grows to a staggering $160,000, a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5: A $7,500 investment awards 500,000 tokens and a 100% bonus, making the total 1 million tokens. With a $1 valuation, this amounts to $1 million, a 13,233% return. Leaderboard Rewards For major contributors, Ruvi AI offers leaderboard bonuses ranging from 20,000 to 500,000 extra RUVI tokens. This additional incentive makes early participation even more rewarding, especially as Phase 2‚Äôs supply runs low. Built for Security and Longevity While fast-paced growth is exciting, Ruvi AI‚Äôs foundation rests on trust and reliability. It recently passed a rigorous audit by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. Key Security Features: Protected Smart Contracts: Designed to resist tampering and vulnerabilities. Transparent Transactions: Investors can trace every token movement on the blockchain, ensuring accountability. With this solid foundation, Ruvi AI inspires confidence in its ability to achieve massive growth while safeguarding investor interests. The Time to Act is Now While Solana‚Äôs trajectory has been impressive, Ruvi AI is paving its own path with blazing success. With 1 million tokens selling daily, and Phase 2 nearing its conclusion, this opportunity may be short-lived. The upcoming 33% price increase will raise tokens to $0.020, making now the time to enter before costs rise. Will you watch from the sidelines as others capitalize, or join the movement that could redefine 2025? Take action today and secure your share of cryptocurrency‚Äôs next Solana.

Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is Your Second Best Shot As Sales Skyrocket After CoinMarketCap Listing, Over 210M Sold Tokens in No Time","Shiba Inu made headlines with its stunning 100x returns, transforming early adopters into overnight millionaires. But if you missed the boat on SHIB, don‚Äôt worry, Ruvi AI (RUVI) could be your next shot at exponential gains. Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale is making waves in the crypto market, already selling over 210 million tokens and gaining immense traction after its high-profile CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing. With 1 million tokens selling daily and a 33% price hike looming as Phase 2 ends, investors on the hunt for life-changing returns are racing to secure their piece of this explosive project. Read on to discover why Ruvi AI is shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto, and why acting fast could mean huge rewards. CoinMarketCap Listing Ignites a Frenzy Appearing on CoinMarketCap isn‚Äôt just a milestone; it‚Äôs a launchpad. Recognized globally as the most trusted crypto-tracking website, CMC‚Äôs endorsement instantly validated Ruvi AI, drawing attention from investors worldwide. The result? A rapid acceleration in token sales that few projects in 2025 can rival. What the Numbers Say 70% of Phase 2 Sold: Over 210 million tokens have already been claimed at $0.015 each. $2.6 Million Raised: A presale performance that showcases Ruvi AI‚Äôs immense investor appeal. 1 Million Tokens Sold Daily: An unrelenting pace that confirms the token‚Äôs growing demand. The window to act is shrinking fast as Phase 3 approaches, which will see prices climb 33% to $0.020. Investing now at the presale phase means maximizing your ROI potential. Can Ruvi AI Deliver Shiba Inu-Level Returns? Shiba Inu succeeded by capitalizing on hype and meme status, but Ruvi AI offers something far more substantial, real-world utility. By combining blockchain transparency with artificial intelligence, Ruvi AI stands out as a token with a purpose, appealing to long-term investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. How Ruvi AI Stands Out 1. Revolutionary AI-Powered Solutions Ruvi AI provides cutting-edge tools that help businesses optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve returns on investment. Unlike Shiba Inu, which relied purely on community-driven campaigns, Ruvi AI solves real issues across industries such as marketing, healthcare, and finance. 2. Transparent Payment Infrastructure Freelancers and digital creators often face payment delays and mismatched expectations. Ruvi AI addresses these gaps with a blockchain-secured payment system that ensures transactions are reliable, instant, and transparent. 3. Broad, Cross-Industry Applications Ruvi AI‚Äôs adaptability enables its use in various sectors, positioning it as a token with real, lasting value. Its multi-industry reach ensures there‚Äôs more to its story than speculative gains, making it a highly scalable project. Breaking Down the ROI Potential Ruvi AI‚Äôs momentum and functionality create significant growth possibilities for both its presale investors and its future community. While it builds on the excitement surrounding SHIB‚Äôs wild ride, Ruvi AI distinguishes itself as a project with practical use cases and sustainable appeal. VIP Rewards for Early Adopters To add even more value for investors, Ruvi AI offers an exclusive VIP tier system that amplifies returns for those who buy in early. Here‚Äôs how the numbers stack up: VIP 2: Investing $750 gets you 50,000 tokens at $0.015 each, along with a 40% bonus of 20,000 more tokens, bringing your total to 70,000 tokens. When the token reaches a $1 valuation, that translates to a potential return of $70,000, a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3: With a $1,500 investment, you secure 100,000 tokens and a 60% bonus, adding 60,000 tokens to your holdings for a total of 160,000 tokens. At $1 per token, your position could be worth $160,000, an ROI of 10,566%. VIP 5: The top tier rewards $7,500 investors with 500,000 tokens plus a 100% bonus, doubling total holdings to 1,000,000 tokens. If RUVI hits $1, this becomes an incredible $1 million, a 13,233% ROI. Leaderboard Rewards Add Even More For major contributors, Ruvi AI‚Äôs leaderboard offers additional incentives, rewarding top buyers with bonuses up to 500,000 extra tokens. The combination of early bird bonuses and leaderboard rewards creates a compelling reason to jump in now. Security You Can Count On While rapid sales and hyped predictions are exciting, security is key for investors seeking long-term gains. Ruvi AI has already passed a comprehensive CyberScope audit, ensuring that its smart contracts and infrastructure are tamper-proof. Key Audit Features Robust, Tamper-Proof Contracts: Designed to safeguard against vulnerabilities or fraud. Blockchain Transparency: Investors can easily trace token movements, creating accountability and trust. This extra layer of security allows Ruvi AI to stand apart from risky altcoins, giving both retail and institutional investors added confidence. Don‚Äôt Miss Your Second Chance If Shiba Inu‚Äôs meteoric rise taught us anything, it‚Äôs that timing is everything. And while SHIB investors may now be enjoying their returns, Ruvi AI is offering a rare opportunity for those who missed out. With 1 million tokens being sold daily and Phase 2 coming to a close, securing your position now could yield life-changing results. This isn‚Äôt just another speculative token, it‚Äôs an advanced blockchain project with real-world applications, global appeal, and early-stage growth that‚Äôs hard to ignore.

2025-08-02 19:14:34,49436380,1754162074,"Weekend Selloff - Here's Why Solana, Cardano And XRP Can Create Fresh Rally Wave On Monday","Crypto enthusiasts witnessed a surprising dip over the weekend, sparking curiosity about potential comebacks. Monday could bring a new wave of growth for Solana , Cardano , and XRP . This article delves into the forces behind this anticipated surge and sheds light on why these specific coins are poised for a fresh rally. Discover the compelling factors at play. Solana Price Insight: Trading Ranges and Market Behavior Solana showed an 8.36% price gain in the past month, contrasting with an 18.78% decline over the previous six months. A weekly drop of 11.52% highlighted short-term challenges while the longer-term picture indicates volatility and mixed market sentiment. Fluctuations during the half-year reveal cautious buying and selling pressure, leading to uneven momentum and sporadic rallies. The gap between recent gains and a broader downtrend suggests improvements in the near term, but the long-term outlook remains unsettled. The coin now trades within a range from $142.76 to $204.07, with resistance at $235.84 and support at $113.22. A second resistance level at $297.15 and additional support at $51.91 provide further reference points. Both bullish and bearish forces are present. The RSI near 43.90 offers little clarity on directional bias, while the Momentum Indicator of -24.25 shows ongoing selling pressure. Traders may look to buy near $113.22 or consider short-term plays around $235.84, as the lack of a clear trend necessitates careful monitoring of these key levels. Cardano (ADA) Market Review: Recent Swings and Current Key Levels Cardano experienced a 24.44% increase in the past month, but a six-month decline of 9.57% highlights the challenges in the long-term outlook. The latest week showed a drop of 10.78%, indicating short-term volatility amid this irregular behavior. Rapid price surges followed by notable pullbacks characterize Cardano's movement, reflecting a market marked by mixed sentiment. While the recent upswing contrasts with the half-year downturn, the overall picture illustrates both resilience and susceptibility to abrupt changes. Current price action places Cardano within a trading corridor from approximately $0.539 at the low end to $0.938 at the high end. Resistance levels are identified at $1.136 and $1.535, while support is noted at $0.338. The Awesome Oscillator suggests slight bullish momentum, though the momentum indicator and RSI indicate ongoing bearish pressure. Price levels between $0.539 and $0.938 present chances for re-entry and profit-taking. Caution is advised as the market lacks a clear trend, with traders advised to watch for moves beyond key levels for better positioning. XRP Rally Hinted by Key Levels and Seasonal Momentum 34.99% monthly growth coupled with a 17.01% gain over the last six months shows XRP undergoing notable price swings. Weekly activity dipped by 3.91%, highlighting short-term consolidation amidst the overall climb. Price fluctuations have demonstrated solid energy over a concentrated period, reflecting a shift from earlier stagnation to a more aggressive upward push recently. The rise in monthly performance stands out against a backdrop of mixed weekly moves, suggesting traders have been active in extracting value from short-term corrections while capitalizing on longer-term trends. Current prices range between $2.23 and $3.74, with a significant resistance level at $4.45 and a secondary hurdle at $5.97 that could signal further upside if breached. Support is clearly marked at $1.43, serving as a safety net in case of a downturn. Technical indicators show mixed sentiment; a momentum reading of -0.167 along with an Awesome Oscillator of 0.192 suggests indecision among traders. The relative strength index is nearly neutral at 51.83, indicating a balance between bullish and bearish forces. Trading within these levels calls for caution, with potential moves hinging on a decisive break above the mid-range resistance or a slide towards support. This environment offers opportunities for both scalping short-term dips and waiting for a clear trend before committing larger positions. Conclusion Monday could see fresh growth for SOL , ADA , and XRP . Despite the recent selloff, these coins have a strong potential for a rebound. The market trends suggest renewed interest and possible upward movement. Watch for increased trading activity and positive market sentiment. This could lead to new highs and overall optimism. Investors remain attentive to these coins' performance. Positive signs point to a potentially stronger start to the week. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-02 09:00:33,49410997,1754125233,Realistic Price Prediction for ADA for August 2025,"Cardano (ADA) is drawing close attention once again as market analysts reevaluate its potential heading into August 2025. After months of consolidation below the $0.50 mark, traders are now eyeing bullish signals that could send the price higher, especially with broader altcoin sentiment improving. Historical patterns show that ADA tends to lag behind Bitcoin‚Äôs rallies before staging abrupt catch-ups‚Äîa trend that could repeat in the coming weeks. With traders anticipating positive ETF rulings and more clarity around blockchain regulation, many are also watching smaller cap plays emerging under the radar. One such name that continues to gain traction across crypto forums and X (Twitter) is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-rising altcoin that‚Äôs now topping social media engagement charts and quickly climbing the meme coin ladder. What Could ADA Be Worth in August 2025? According to projections from Perplexity AI and Gemini-based models, Cardano could trade between $0.68 and $1.10 by late August, assuming Bitcoin sustains its $80K+ range and altcoin liquidity remains strong. A mid-range target of $0.89 has been assigned by technical forecasters based on support-resistance zones on the weekly chart. This would represent an 80%+ rise from ADA‚Äôs current range if confirmed. Fueling this optimism are developments in the Cardano ecosystem, including the Midnight sidechain and more frequent mentions of ADA in ETF speculation reports. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that any delay in broader market recovery could push ADA‚Äôs surge into Q4 instead. A New Contender Dominates the Meme Coin Buzz While large-cap assets like ADA wait for confirmation, one emerging altcoin is already dominating buzz metrics, with multiple trend-tracking platforms now placing it above traditional meme tokens in user mentions and engagement. The project‚Äôs early-stage phase is drawing comparisons to the explosive early days of SHIBA INU ‚Äì but with more structure and actual development milestones in place. With early-stage slots filling rapidly and round closings happening in record time, some are now calling it a top contender for 2025‚Äôs breakout altcoin. A small sum invested today could potentially mirror previous meme token surges and turn into a fortune, based on past cycles and current entry prices. Investors are watching closely as major exchange listings appear to be on the horizon. What Could Push ADA Higher? Several catalysts could propel ADA toward the upper end of its projected range. These include an ETF announcement involving Cardano, a successful Midnight airdrop event, and renewed whale accumulation patterns. Developer activity remains high, and ADA‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem has grown steadily, giving it more long-term utility than some competitors. Still, it‚Äôs the broader crypto sentiment that may ultimately determine ADA‚Äôs August performance. If Bitcoin breaks new highs and capital rotates into quality altcoins, Cardano could see a delayed but strong upside reaction. Conclusion Cardano may be on the edge of a potential rebound as technical indicators and market sentiment start to turn. With price models forecasting up to $1.10 and the altcoin market heating up, ADA remains one to watch in August 2025. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight in the meme coin space, rapidly overtaking old favorites with record-breaking activity and community growth.

2025-08-02 08:59:03,49411623,1754125143,Best presale crypto for early gains: BPENGU offers up to 75% before listing,"July 2025 marked a historic month for crypto investment funds, attracting a staggering $11.2 billion in inflows and pushing total assets under management (AUM) to around $221 billion, a clear signal that institutional excitement and retail interest are converging in unprecedented fashion. Amid this surge, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU) is emerging as a standout opportunity with its limited 30-day presale launching July 28 and a confirmed listing date set for September 2, 2025. With a hard cap of $10 million, this exclusive presale window is poised to close fast, rewarding early supporters with rising token prices every two days across 15 stages. Bitcoin Penguins is where crypto meets cool Bitcoin Penguins is where meme culture waddle meets Bitcoin‚Äôs legendary pedigree. By fusing the viral momentum of penguin-themed NFTs with Bitcoin‚Äôs status as digital gold, BPENGU is more than a token, it‚Äôs a movement. Tailored for the crypto crowd craving both fun and fundamentals, BPENGU runs on Solana‚Äôs blazing-fast blockchain, offering low fees, high scalability, and a smart presale design. The presale spans 15 stages over 30 days, each with a 5% price increase to reward early buyers handsomely. Purchase in Stage 1, and you secure tokens at $0.00100 before prices climb, potentially gaining over 75% before listing. Smart presale designed for growth Beyond its compelling narrative, BPENGU‚Äôs presale mechanics stand out as a technical feature crafted to reward early investors while maintaining sustainable demand. The 15-stage flash presale spans 30 days, with each stage lasting approximately two days and featuring a 5% price increment. Early-stage buyers benefit from significantly discounted entry, securing a low price of $0.00100 in Stage 1. By Stage 15, tokens will be priced near $0.00198, incentivizing urgent participation. The presale hard cap is set at $10 million, adding scarcity and urgency. By gradually increasing the price across presale stages, the model encourages early participation and discourages last-minute FOMO buys. It‚Äôs designed to build a strong, invested community that‚Äôs in it for more than just a quick flip. Out of the 10 billion total BPENGU tokens, more than half, 55% are set aside for presale participants. The remaining supply is split across staking, liquidity, community initiatives, and team allocations, aiming to keep things fair, transparent, and built for the long haul. Penguins, profits, and presale perks-BPENGU has it all July‚Äôs record $11.2 billion inflows into crypto funds signal growing investor confidence, especially in altcoins and Ethereum-based assets. Ethereum alone absorbed $1.59 billion in inflows, outpacing Bitcoin, which recently saw minor outflows, an early sign that altseason may be dawning. BPENGU is perfectly timed to capitalize on this shift. With Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing macro momentum and altcoin enthusiasm heating up, BPENGU‚Äôs presale offers rare access to a token that combines meme culture hype with Bitcoin-backed credibility. The confirmed September 2 listing means tokens won‚Äôt linger in limbo, while the 15-stage dynamic pricing rewards swift action. Altcoins like Solana and XRP also saw strong inflows, proving the appetite for promising projects is alive and well. BPENGU‚Äôs roadmap is ambitious, targeting a $2 price point by November 2025, implying a possible 1000x return from presale prices. Strategic partnerships, community competitions, and innovative staking programs further boost its appeal for high-risk, high-reward investors ready to ride the next wave.

Key Takeaways: Mill City plans to raise $500M to expand its SUI token treasury after a $450M initial investment. The stock dropped over 11% following the announcement, despite being up 165% since July 24. Mill City is positioning itself as the first institutional-grade Sui treasury with official backing. The announcement came just days after Mill City secured $450 million via the sale of 83 million shares to institutional investors, including Pantera Capital, Electric Capital, ParaFi Capital, and FalconX. The firm used those funds to purchase 76.2 million SUI tokens valued at $276 million. The remaining capital will support its existing short-term lending operations. Mill City Stock Sinks After Announcing $500M Equity Line Shares of the finance firm dropped 11.4% to $4.91 on Friday following the announcement, with after-hours trading extending losses by another 4.28%, according to Google Finance. ‚ÄúThis equity line is intended to give us the firepower to scale our position as the only Sui treasury on the market with an official Sui Foundation relationship,‚Äù said Stephen Mackintosh, Mill City‚Äôs Chief Investment Officer. He described the move as a step toward offering institutional-grade exposure to the Sui ecosystem through public markets. Mill City‚Äôs strategy aligns with a growing trend among public companies to diversify their crypto treasuries beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. In recent weeks, firms have added BNB, Solana, and XRP to their portfolios. Welcome to Sui, Mill City Ventures. With Mill City‚Äôs launch today, everyone can access Sui on Nasdaq. Together, we are showing what‚Äôs possible when blockchain is built for mass adoption. Public market access unlocks greater retail and institutional participation‚Äîand a stronger‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2m3UBTeZTM ‚Äî Sui (@SuiNetwork) August 1, 2025 However, Mill City is positioning itself as a specialized SUI treasury, aiming to take advantage of the layer-1 blockchain‚Äôs focus on low-latency, scalable infrastructure for AI and gaming applications. The firm‚Äôs new $500 million equity line was arranged with Alliance Global Partners and is intended to further scale its position in SUI. While investors initially reacted negatively, the broader trajectory of MCVT stock remains bullish, it‚Äôs still up 165% since July 24, when the SUI initiative was first unveiled. Galaxy Asset Management is overseeing Mill City‚Äôs SUI holdings as the official treasury manager. At the time of writing, SUI is trading at $3.45, down 2.4% on the day, mirroring the wider market downturn. Crypto Treasuries Aren‚Äôt Really Buying Crypto A growing number of publicly traded companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build crypto treasuries, but one analyst says many aren‚Äôt actually buying digital assets from the open market . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders. Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

Hines noted that the US has officially established a digital asset reserve, and that Bitcoin is considered a ‚Äúunique asset class.‚Äù The government‚Äôs goal is to ‚Äúhold as much Bitcoin as possible.‚Äù Trump officially established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and National Digital Asset Stockpile with an executive order he signed in March. However, the initiative received only brief mention in the White House's cryptocurrency policy report released this week. Speaking on Crypto in America, Hines said, ‚ÄúWe believe in the accumulation strategy. The reserve has been established. We also have a strategic national digital asset stockpile. Bitcoin is in a class of its own, and everyone recognizes that.‚Äù Related News: Is the Rally in XRP Over or Just Getting Started? Pay Close Attention to These Levels Hines emphasized that establishing the infrastructure requires time and effort, but that the process is progressing well. ‚ÄúThere's still a lot to do, but I believe people will like the direction we're heading. Concrete steps will be taken soon.‚Äù While the report cited establishing a regulatory framework to strengthen American leadership in digital financial technologies as a top priority, it did not provide details about the Bitcoin reserve. Hines, however, said the reserve plan was ‚Äústeadily progressing.‚Äù Hines, who declined to answer questions about how much Bitcoin the federal government holds, said, ‚ÄúI can't disclose that right now. There are a few reasons, but we can share them when the time comes. All I can say is, we want to own as much BTC as we can, and we're working toward that goal.‚Äù According to blockchain analysis firm Nansen, the US government is estimated to hold approximately 198,000 BTC, or approximately $2.35 billion worth of assets. *This is not investment advice.

Here Are the Details,"Ripple‚Äôs ambition to expand its financial infrastructure took a formal step with the release of Volume 1 of its Interagency Charter Application, submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman), a crypto commentator on X, shared an analysis of the document, which outlines the company‚Äôs proposal to establish Ripple National Trust Bank . This is a limited-purpose national trust bank that would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ripple Labs and be headquartered in New York. Though Ripple has been synonymous with the digital asset XRP, the application focuses more on its native stablecoin RLUSD. #Ripple ‚Äôs OCC Banking License application is now available! Vol. 1 is the public release. The application provides some clues about Ripple‚Äôs intentions and structure to consider. 1/6 pic.twitter.com/Qzr0dIASdD ‚Äî WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 2, 2025 The Purpose of Ripple‚Äôs Bank As the filing shows , Ripple is not applying for a traditional banking license involving deposit-taking or lending activities. Instead, the bank will handle fiduciary activities, enabling it to provide custody and infrastructure services in line with OCC oversight. Importantly, the trust bank will not fall under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which applies only to institutions that engage in lending or deposit activities. The application states that, ‚Äúas a national trust bank, the Trust Bank will not be subject to the CRA.‚Äù This positions the bank squarely within a business-to-business (B2B) framework, focused on custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management, rather than retail banking. WrathofKahneman drew attention to XRP‚Äôs absence from the application. He believes that this move may be an intentional separation to avoid entangling a regulated banking entity with XRP because it has faced legal scrutiny . Still, the absence does not rule out a future XRP integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Confidential Strategy and Potential IPO Another dimension to the filing relates to Ripple‚Äôs internal structure and compensation plans. The application references a confidential stock benefit plan included in an unpublished exhibit, indicating that the company will issue private stock to executives and insiders. While this practice is not unusual, WrathofKahneman noted that the confidentiality suggests a broader corporate strategy, potentially in anticipation of increased scrutiny or even a future Initial Public Offering (IPO) . Ripple‚Äôs Commitment to Experience and Expertise The Trust Bank‚Äôs operational and governance structure also reveals Ripple‚Äôs commitment to experienced oversight. The initial list of organizers includes John McDonald, a seasoned financial executive and President of Standard Custody & Trust Company, and John Zavaglia, Ripple‚Äôs Treasurer with extensive experience in corporate finance and treasury operations. It also includes Stuart Alderoty , Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, with over 35 years in regulatory and legal leadership across major financial institutions, Timothy Keaney, a former Vice Chairman of BNY Mellon, and David Puth, former CEO of CLS Group and Centre Consortium. Together, they will form the initial five-member board of directors, with Ripple retaining full ownership of the entity.

2025-08-02 08:30:32,49409727,1754123432,Realistic Price Prediction for XRP for the End of 2025,"XRP remains one of the most talked-about digital assets heading into 2025. After years of legal battles and price stagnation, the token is finally showing signs of breakout potential. With the SEC lawsuit mostly behind it and increasing interest from institutional players, XRP may be on the verge of reclaiming the momentum it once had during its all-time high days. While XRP continues to capture attention, emerging altcoins are also gaining rapid traction. One standout is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project now drawing comparisons to Dogecoin‚Äôs historic rally . Analysts note that early-stage growth, community enthusiasm, and a swelling holder base are beginning to mirror what DOGE experienced before its mainstream explosion . XRP Price Forecast: Will 2025 Be the Breakout Year? Many analysts now point to $2.50‚Äì$3.00 as a realistic range for XRP by the end of 2025, assuming regulatory clarity holds and utility adoption expands. The return of institutional trust, fueled by growing cross-border partnerships and the potential for new ETFs, could accelerate demand. One of the bullish indicators lies in the increased on-chain activity for XRP, which has risen steadily since mid-2024. Coupled with Ripple‚Äôs expansion into Asia and the Middle East, the network could gain further traction in high-volume corridors where traditional banking remains inefficient. Rapid Momentum Sparks Investor Buzz As XRP regains its footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining fast among those hunting for the next breakout. The project has seen a surge in demand, with round allocations selling out rapidly. What‚Äôs driving the hype is a combination of strong community engagement, expanding use cases, and new milestones achieved almost weekly. Some traders now speculate that early MAGACOIN FINANCE buyers could see gains rivaling DOGE‚Äôs epic run, especially with the presale stages nearing their final rounds . Momentum metrics have hit all-time highs , with analysts warning that presale access may soon vanish entirely for new participants. For those watching the next potential meme-to-mainstream story unfold, this may be the last window to get in early. What to Watch for XRP Next While XRP‚Äôs move back to $3 would represent a major victory for long-term holders, it would still leave room for additional upside should mass adoption accelerate. Analysts caution that XRP still faces headwinds from a saturated altcoin market and lingering regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. But if current trends hold, XRP could position itself as a leader in global payments once again. Conclusion XRP‚Äôs path toward a $3 valuation by the end of 2025 appears increasingly realistic as investor confidence returns and institutional interest rises. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of the year, with momentum building in ways that echo Dogecoin‚Äôs legendary climb. Both assets offer compelling narratives‚Äîbut one is still available at ground-floor levels.

According to prominent crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), the digital asset‚Äôs market cap dominance remains in what he describes as ‚Äúthe most bullish formation.‚Äù The accompanying chart illustrates a long-term bullish pennant pattern , a setup that historically carries a strong likelihood of breaking upward, typically between 60% and 65%, based on EGRAG‚Äôs notes. #XRP Dominance ‚Äì Still in the Most Bullish Formation! #XRP Dominance is currently navigating a crucial threshold!

Within this context, recent price action has moved above a key long-term resistance zone, currently undergoing a crucial retest. EGRAG CRYPTO states the importance of holding the 4.5% level, stating that maintaining this level is vital for the continuation of the bullish pennant formation. Another analyst recently drew attention to the shifting market sentiment as traders are moving away from Bitcoin to altcoins . The chart shows that XRP Dominance has tested major support zones on multiple occasions. Each of these retests preceded major upward movements. These helped it reach current levels. Now, the asset appears to be mirroring this behavior once again. Breakout Potential and Target Zones The white rectangular region on the chart, positioned around the 4.5% to 5.75% range, represents a historically significant resistance zone that could soon become support. The market is currently engaging with this region, and a successful hold above it could validate the bullish turn. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Above this area lies what EGRAG refers to as the ‚ÄúVOID,‚Äù a region lacking major historical resistance, potentially allowing XRP to shift toward a price discovery phase . Projected targets are outlined at 21% and 27%. These translate to $13.34 and $17.15, placing XRP firmly within double-digit territory . Additionally, the analyst highlighted crucial resistance levels, aligning with Fibonacci extension levels. These are 11.44% (Fib. 0.702), 15.22% (Fib. 0.786), 21.54% (Fib. 0.888), and 31.54% (Fib. 1). At current market values, these translate to $7.27, $9.67, $13.68, and $20.04. It‚Äôs also important to note that this analysis is built on a monthly timeframe. As EGRAG emphasizes, signals on this scale are typically more stable and less prone to short-term volatility. Supporting indicators such as moving averages and long-term trendlines are also integrated into the chart, showing the gradual curvature upward, supporting the notion of building bullish momentum.

The model anticipates key momentum from rising transaction volumes, network adoption, and use cases in sectors like gaming and DeFi. As more investors seek early exposure to promising altcoins, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also drawing serious attention. With interest accelerating and presale access tightening, analysts say it may represent one of the last remaining early-stage opportunities with immense potential. Solana Could Surge to $315, Says Gemini AI According to Gemini AI‚Äôs base-case projection, Solana could hit $550 by 2029, with a potential high of around $590-600 if current adoption trends hold. The platform has recently seen a spike in developer activity, increased institutional integrations, and expanding retail engagement‚Äîfactors that strengthen its long-term growth case. These predictions are supported by sustained demand for Solana-based NFT marketplaces, payment apps, and staking protocols. If the macro environment remains favorable, Gemini‚Äôs model assigns a 72% probability of Solana delivering a 2‚Äì3x return by 2030 . Presale Access Dwindles as MAGACOIN FINANCE Heats Up Amid the growing interest in altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now attracting a flood of investor activity , with many comparing its momentum to the early days of projects like SHIBA INU and even Solana itself. Presale spots are rapidly disappearing, and participation metrics show a sharp rise in new buyer engagement. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its approach to sustainable growth and ecosystem expansion. Unlike flash-in-the-pan meme tokens, this project offers actual utility, a clear roadmap, and strategic staking rewards . For those seeking to enter before the wave of exchange listings, the window to act is closing fast. What Could Fuel Solana‚Äôs Next Rally? Solana‚Äôs future depends on continued scaling and sustained user engagement. If the network can maintain uptime stability, reduce congestion, and retain its edge in low-cost transactions, Gemini AI believes the asset will remain a top performer in the Layer-1 race. With Ethereum‚Äôs scaling challenges still unresolved, Solana‚Äôs speed and ecosystem-wide upgrades could keep it front and center in the next crypto bull market. Combined with a broader shift toward utility-driven altcoins, Solana remains one of the most closely watched assets heading into 2026, but MAGACOIN is beginning to take the spotlight..

2025-08-02 08:00:24,49408236,1754121624,Bitcoin‚Äôs $115K Struggle: Is a Deeper Drop on the Horizon?,"Bitcoin (BTC) is facing renewed downward pressure as it struggles to maintain levels above $115,000. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading around $115,745, down approximately 2.2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 6% below its July all-time high of $123,000. The latest market movement has raised questions about short-term price stability, particularly amid growing concerns over weak structural support in the current trading zone. Recent data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant suggests that while long-term holders remain largely profitable, short-term sentiment has shifted. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Next Big Move? Cooling Futures Market Hints at Possible Breakout Bitcoin UTXO Data Points to Changing Investor Behavior Activity among Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), a metric that tracks coins being spent either in profit or at a loss, indicates that many investors are beginning to react to smaller price drops, potentially signaling increased market uncertainty. In a recent analysis on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform, contributor Darkfost shared insights on how UTXO activity can reflect broader market sentiment. ‚ÄúThis chart, based on UTXOs from block data, highlights the number of UTXOs spent either in profit or in loss,‚Äù the analyst wrote, noting that this approach focuses on transaction count rather than value, helping filter out price-based noise. Historically, Bitcoin has seen a dominance of UTXOs spent in profit, with patient holders benefiting from long-term appreciation. Between July 11 and 13, the ratio of profitable UTXOs compared to those spent at a loss surged above 10,000, meaning for every loss-making spend, there were over ten thousand profitable ones. However, this ratio has since declined to around 500, suggesting that some investors are now closing positions at a loss even with minor price retracements. This change, according to Darkfost, may indicate short-term selling pressure despite the overall profitable status of most holders. Weak Support Structure Adds to Downside Risk Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, highlighted structural weaknesses in Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price surge. On July 10, BTC rapidly climbed from $112,000 to $115,800, but this upward move left little on-chain support in the price range. Bitcoin Teleported from $112 to $115.8K ‚Äì But There‚Äôs Thin Air Below ‚ÄúFrom a technical point of view, there‚Äôs no past resistance or consolidation that could now act as support.

Despite years of dominating blockchain payments, Ripple‚Äôs dominance of the PayFi sector now seems to be slipping, especially with newer projects gaining traction. A hot new name is Remittix (RTX) , a crypto-to-fiat settlement network that aims to make remittances and spending everywhere easier to understand.‚Äù. With price action of XRP under intense scrutiny by investors, all eyes turn toward alternatives that really offer working products ‚Äî not legacy market share or court wins. XRP Price Dives, Market Flips XRP took a nose dive to $3.02, which is down 2.37% in 24 hours, even while witnessing a whopping $9.38 billion rise in trading volume. The actual fall has created rumors: is it that whales are reshuffling, or that sentiments have begun sifting in the market? Ripple has been way out in front of the blockchain payment push for years, but waiting on legal clarity and scaling answers has left room for new entrants. That is where Remittix enters the picture ‚Äî not as a disruptor, but as the next chapter in PayFi. Though XRP remains a front-runner, buyers now share their portfolios, going for new tokens that have usability and small entry points. With Remittix priced at just $0.0842, the upside potential seems much more appealing to early adopters. Remittix Wallet Launch May Change the PayFi Market Arriving in Q3 2025, the Remittix Wallet is used for instant fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions across 30+ countries. It enables sending BTC, ETH, or XRP straight into a local bank account ‚Äî no intermediaries, no delay. Unlike the majority of wallets, this wallet is not for storage purposes only ‚Äî it‚Äôs designed for everyday payments, business, and international remittances. From Latin America freelancers to European small businesses, Remittix is the financial link they‚Äôve been seeking. Key Remittix Wallet Features: Crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ nations Mobile-first PayFi wallet with competitive fees Real-time FX rates on every transaction 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat pairs supported Designed for global users, not just traders Remittix Project: Hype vs. Numbers The Remittix (RTX) presale is gaining momentum. With nearly $18 million in funds raised, and 578 million tokens sold, it‚Äôs clear the demand is picking up speed. Early investors now receive a 50% bonus, and this adds even more value before listings go live. The cross-chain functionality of the wallet, crypto staking, and business API plans set Remittix apart from being a hype token. It‚Äôs an operational solution with clear direction ‚Äî and that separates it from 99% of presales out there.

Recently, the broader crypto market has endured consistent downturns, keeping the price of major assets like SHIB at lower levels. The latest bloodbath happened toward the end of July, starting with the Fed‚Äôs refusal to slash interest rates.¬†U.S. President Donald Trump mounted further pressure on financial markets, including crypto, after unveiling his administration‚Äôs latest reciprocal tariff plan. That announcement ushered in a major downturn, with SHIB‚Äôs price crashing to $0.00001179.¬†Despite reclaiming $0.000012 shortly after the dip, SHIB remains far from reaching some ambitious targets, specifically the one-cent dream or $0.01 price.¬†Team Believes SHIB Can Reach $0.01¬†This price forecast has sparked a significant debate within the community, with top enthusiasts deliberating on whether SHIB could attain the target. Interestingly, Lucie, the lead of marketing at Shiba Inu, has also joined the debate.¬†The marketing lead emphasized that she has always had faith in Shiba Inu‚Äôs ultimate rally to the $0.01 target. This has been Lucie‚Äôs aspirational goal for SHIB since she became a holder in 2021.¬†Despite believing in Shiba Inu‚Äôs capacity to rally towards $0.01, she cautioned that SHIB will not reach the target immediately. Lucie stressed that everything, including SHIB‚Äôs potential surge to $0.01, requires time to materialize.¬†Lucie has been a firm believer in Shiba Inu, suggesting that the token will kick off the bull run. Her confidence stems from the team‚Äôs dedication to enhancing SHIB‚Äôs utility, which has led to the birth of several projects, such as Shibarium, ShibaSwap, non-fungible tokens, and P2E games like Shiba Eternity. The team is also intensifying efforts to reduce SHIB‚Äôs enormous supply of 589 trillion. This is evident in the team‚Äôs allocation of Shibarium gas fees to token burns.¬†Given Lucie‚Äôs knowledge of the Shiba Inu ecosystem and the things happening behind the scenes, she believes the token could reach $0.01 in its lifetime. However, she cautioned that it may take time for this prediction to materialize.¬†Debate About SHIB $0.01 Forecast Spike¬†As mentioned earlier, deliberations about the possibility of $0.01 prediction coming to fruition have not cooled off, with the community divided into two separate views.¬†One part features the likes of Lucie, Luis Delgado , and YourPOP , who believe $0.01 is a realistic target for SHIB. However, most commentators regard the $0.01 target as unattainable, given the extraordinary growth rate SHIB would need to achieve it.¬†For context, from the current price of $0.00001201, Shiba Inu would require a rally of 83,163% to reach $0.01. This estimated price is equivalent to a market capitalization of $5.89 trillion, assuming Shiba Inu‚Äôs supply remains the same at 589 trillion tokens.¬†Proponents of this theory believe that the only way SHIB can attain the $0.01 target is if it burns a massive chunk of its supply and the token attracts the attention of institutional investors. So far, no institutions have shown such interest, nor has any spot ETF been filed for the token.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,1,despite shiba inu continuous stay around region top team member express belief shib eventually hit someday recently broader crypto market endured consistent downturn keeping price major asset like shib lower level latest bloodbath happened toward end july starting fed refusal slash interest president donald trump mounted pressure financial market including crypto unveiling administration latest reciprocal tariff plan announcement ushered major downturn shib price crashing despite reclaiming shortly dip shib remains far reaching ambitious target specifically dream price team belief shib reach price forecast sparked significant debate within community top enthusiast deliberating whether shib could attain target interestingly lucie lead marketing shiba inu also joined debate marketing lead emphasized always faith shiba inu ultimate rally target lucie aspirational goal shib since became holder despite believing shiba inu capacity rally towards cautioned shib reach target immediately lucie stressed everything including shib potential surge requires time materialize lucie firm believer shiba inu suggesting token kick bull run confidence stem team dedication enhancing shib utility led birth several project shibarium shibaswap token game like shiba eternity team also intensifying effort reduce shib enormous supply trillion evident team allocation shibarium gas fee token burn given lucie knowledge shiba inu ecosystem thing happening behind scene belief token could reach lifetime however cautioned may take time prediction materialize debate shib forecast spike mentioned earlier deliberation possibility prediction coming fruition cooled community divided two separate view one part feature like lucie luis delgado yourpop believe realistic target shib however commentator regard target unattainable given extraordinary growth rate shib would need achieve context current price shiba inu would require rally reach estimated price equivalent market capitalization trillion assuming shiba inu supply remains trillion token proponent theory believe way shib attain target burn massive chunk supply token attracts attention institutional investor far institution shown interest spot etf filed token,0.026,0.794,0.18,0.9918,1

2025-08-02 07:33:56,49407046,1754120036,From $115K to $150K? The Bullish Case for Bitcoin‚Äôs Year-End Comeback,"As July closed out, Bitcoin suffered a notable pullback as it corrected to approximately $113K ‚Äì a decline of several thousand dollars from mid-month highs north of $123K. Despite the setback, the market watchers remain bullish about the world‚Äôs largest crypto asset‚Äôs prospects for the year-end. $115K Now, $150K Soon? As Bitcoin mining enters the second half of 2025, the sector‚Äôs fundamentals remain strong, but the room for errors is shrinking. The analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash predicts that the crypto asset will trade between $130,000 and $150,000 by year-end, if the ETF inflows remain and the macroeconomic backdrop remains consistent. In a statement to CryptoPotato , TeraHash said that several factors are at play. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs expected rate cut in September, along with regulatory clarity from the SEC, CFTC, and the full implementation of Europe‚Äôs MiCA framework in Q4, are expected to play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment. ‚ÄúOn-chain, hashrate is expected to reach ~1.2 ZH/s, with mining difficulty climbing toward 140T, driven by large-scale deployment of next-gen ASICs and geographic expansion into energy-advantaged regions such as Paraguay, Oman, and parts of Africa. But as costs rise and competition accelerates, miners without efficient hardware or access to low-cost energy will struggle to remain profitable.‚Äù At the same time, Hashrate-as-a-Service (HaaS) offerings are gaining traction among institutional investors, as they provide a lower-risk avenue to gain mining exposure. As the post-halving environment increasingly favors scale and strategic execution, the latter half of 2025 will test miners‚Äô adaptability. ‚ÄúBitcoin mining in late 2025 is about precision, adaptability, and staying ahead in a system that grows more competitive with every block.‚Äù Jaw-Dropping BTC Prediction While a certain cohort of investors has resorted to profit-taking, long-term bullish sentiment remains intact. For instance, Tom‚ÄØLee of Fundstrat Global Advisors came up with an even bolder prediction that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by year-end. Prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper also believes that the crypto asset could hit that milestone. Amid all the furor, financial giant Charles Schwab, as well as billionaire CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz, predict that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by the end of 2025.

Notably, this is all his ENA holdings, worth $4.62 million at the time of the transfer.Two minutes later, he transferred 38.86 billion PEPE worth $415,470 to Cumberland DRW. Arthur then started converting his wrapped Ethereum (WETH) to Ethereum for sale.Arkham shows that he unwrapped 2,095 ETH ($7.86 million) over two transactions on the Uniswap V3 pool, receiving the 1:1 reciprocal in Ethereum. Following the conversion, he transferred them to centralized trading platforms.First, he moved 1,000 ETH ($3.5 million) to B2C2, a liquidity provider and trading platform based in London. He then offloaded 1,373 ETH ($4.82 million) to Binance Deposit, bringing the total to 2,373 ETH ($8.32 million). Notably, the offset came from his outstanding Ethereum stash, currently standing at 233,444 ETH ($824,390).

2025-08-02 07:30:31,49407033,1754119831,Gemini AI Predicts XRP Price for the Next 5 Years,"Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming a tool of choice for forecasting crypto prices, and Gemini AI‚Äôs latest model has delivered a bold multi-year projection for XRP. The platform expects Ripple‚Äôs native token to outperform in the coming years, supported by institutional adoption and the rollout of tokenized financial infrastructure. Amid this surge in AI-driven interest, investors are also turning to earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which just posted its highest-ever level of weekly user interaction. The project‚Äôs momentum is fueling comparisons to the early days of many top projects ‚Äì where small investments turned into life-changing gains . XRP Forecast by Year: AI Models Suggest Steady Growth Gemini AI outlines a bullish case for XRP through 2029. In the short term, the model sees XRP revisiting its previous all-time high of $3.84 as early as 2025, with upside linked to ETF speculation and cross-border settlement use cases. By 2026, the forecast estimates a climb to $6.20, driven by banking partnerships and broader regulatory clarity. If Ripple‚Äôs legal environment stabilizes, the path toward $9.30 by 2027 becomes increasingly likely. For 2028 and 2029, Gemini AI predicts XRP could break into double digits, reaching $12.75 and $15.60 respectively. These targets are tied to broader adoption of blockchain for government-backed digital currencies and improved global remittance rails. While XRP maintains its stronghold in the top crypto ranks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exploding with fresh investor momentum. This week marked its most active community participation yet, with analysts citing record-breaking growth in engagement and funding velocity. With rising demand and a finite presale allocation, early backers are eyeing returns that could rival 2021‚Äôs biggest altcoin success stories . Conclusion If Gemini AI‚Äôs model is right, XRP could see significant growth over the next five years‚Äîbut the biggest winners may come from the projects just entering the spotlight now. With MAGACOIN FINANCE hitting historic engagement milestones, many investors are taking notice before the gates fully open.

2025-08-02 07:30:00,49407119,1754119800,2 Best Cryptos to Buy as DeFi Summer Catches Momentum,"As the DeFi summer narrative begins to heat up once again, investors are closely watching cryptos poised to ride the momentum of a revived decentralized finance ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ethereum (ETH) are capturing outsized attention. Mutuum Finance is at a price of $0.035 during phase 6 of presale. Those investing now are guaranteed a 71.43% ROI at launch. Mutuum Finance has already sold over $13.9 million and has more than 14,800 investors on board. Alongside Ethereum (ETH), Mutuum Finance is the top crypto to buy now. Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims $3,000 Amid DeFi Summer Momentum Ethereum is currently trading at $3,618. Technical signals like the breakout from a symmetrical triangle, rising open interest, and sustained ETF inflows suggest momentum is strengthening. Common 2025 price target is ranging from $4,000 to $6,000, and some bullish forecasts extend to $7,000‚Äì$8,000 if institutional demand continues to grow. In this rising DeFi environment, interest is also shifting toward emerging protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Accelerates Growth with Phase 6 Launch Mutuum Finance is performing well in presale, selling out the 5th round ahead of schedule. The project is now in round 6 valued at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is transforming the DeFi world by creating an extensible financial system with use cases in real life. The presale has gained more than 14,800 token owners and raised more than $13.9 million. $100K Worth of Tokens Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance has also launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be awarded a $10,000 prize in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is proof of how committed the project remains towards building a long-term and loyal fan base. CertiK-Backed Bug Bounty Boosts DeFi Security In another bid towards its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team will reward a maximum of $50,000 USDT to the participants who identify likely vulnerabilities in the project. The aim of the bounty program is to obtain a suitable coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is segmented into the four classes of severity; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the commitment of the team towards the security of ecosystem along with investors‚Äô trust. Next-Gen Dual-Lending Solutions Mutuum Finance is among the top DeFi projects on which the users are in absolute control of their assets. The project applies a double-lending mechanism for provision of flexibility alongside the effectiveness which comprises Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract uses a self-executing smart contract that conducts the lending automatically with no human intervention, programmed to respond to the change in market prices based on a floating rate of interest according to what exists at the time of the demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the middlemen and has a possibility of being directly linked to lenders and borrowers. It is even more common in meme coins because it has a possibility of having specified terms of a loan and flexibility based on the risk-bearing willingness of a user. Ethereum (ETH) may be reclaiming momentum above $3,600, but it‚Äôs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that‚Äôs turning heads with its early-stage growth. Currently in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, MUTM offers a guaranteed 71.43% ROI at launch price $0.06. The next price jump to $0.04 is coming soon. So far, over $13.9 million has been raised, and more than 14,800 investors are already in.

2025-08-02 07:27:37,49406867,1754119657,International Bar Association: Ripple (XRP) v. SEC Will Set a Precedent for Crypto Industry,"While regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. work to establish clearer digital asset legislation, the judiciary has taken on a more immediate role in determining how cryptocurrencies are treated under existing legal frameworks. The Ripple lawsuit , specifically its handling of XRP token sales, has become a pivotal moment in U.S. crypto law. In the recent publication by the International Bar Association (IBA), titled Digital Regulations in the Metaverse Era, the Ripple case is referenced as having significant potential to influence how courts draw boundaries in token-based transactions. The analysis focuses on how the court, under Judge Analisa Torres, made a distinction between ‚Äúdirect contractual efforts between issuers/promoters and purchasers‚Äù versus general ‚Äúmarket purchasing in the token space.‚Äù This differentiation could become the basis for future case law affecting both developers and investors across the cryptocurrency landscape. The International Bar Association affirms that the outcome of Ripple v. SEC will set a precedent for the entire cryptocurrency industry. This is documented below. https://t.co/aHaf8WoiE2 pic.twitter.com/0ZqnVG8X8t ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 XRP and the Judicial Line Drawn At the core of the case was whether XRP constituted a security under U.S. law. The court found that Ripple‚Äôs sales of XRP on public exchanges did not violate existing securities laws , though it did rule against Ripple‚Äôs direct sales to institutional investors. This decision ultimately provided Ripple with a legal win that many in the industry had anticipated for years, and opened up the U.S. market for XRP adoption. While the lawsuit extended much longer than that ruling, the decision was pivotal and remains unchanged despite subsequent developments in the lawsuit. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications Beyond Ripple and XRP In the highlighted section, it notes that rulings ‚Äúhave the potential to create a precedent in the cryptocurrency industry.‚Äù This includes how courts might interpret relationships between promoters and token buyers moving forward. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) highlighted this development with an image from the IBA‚Äôs report, reinforcing the relevance of the precedent set by XRP. That judicial distinction could have a lasting influence on how new tokens are structured, marketed, and offered in secondary markets. Ripple fought for clarity for XRP, and now market participants can draw from this outcome when crafting token strategies that minimize legal exposure. The precedent doesn‚Äôt resolve all regulatory uncertainty, but it offers a functional distinction that may influence future enforcement actions. The cryptocurrency space is finally receiving proper regulation through the recently passed GENIUS Act , and additional bills are currently being considered by the U.S. government. XRP will always hold a unique role in setting an important precedent for crypto regulation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-08-02 07:26:01,49423637,1754119561,"Uphold‚Äôs XRP to $1,000 Comments Make Waves Again","The long-standing speculation about XRP reaching $1,000 has resurfaced as a community member revisited past posts by U.S.-based exchange Uphold. Earlier today, X user HchannelX brought attention back to Uphold's past tweets speculating on an XRP price of $1,000. While the posts, dating as far back as 2020, were intended as hypothetical prompts, they continue to stir excitement among XRP holders who view the scenario as a long-term possibility.One of the tweets from Uphold, originally posted in late 2021, asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôd do if XRP reached $1,000?‚Äù Although never meant as a price prediction, these posts have repeatedly gone viral, often interpreted by some community members as indirect bullish signals. Now, with XRP trading around $3, these old tweets are gaining new relevance.A $1,000 XRP Would Be MonumentalAt the current price of $3, XRP would need to rise by 33,233% to reach $1,000. Such an increase would turn a $1,000 investment today into more than $330,000, a dream scenario for many long-term holders.The hypothetical milestone would also give XRP a market capitalization of over $59 trillion based on its circulating supply today. For comparison, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap is currently around $2.26 trillion, and the total crypto market stands just above $3.7 trillion.Despite the enormous leap required, the community‚Äôs appetite for big numbers remains strong.XRP Army Reaction to $1,000 Price OutlookResponding to Uphold‚Äôs original question about what holders would do if XRP reached $1,000 , XRP enthusiasts have shared various aspirational goals. Some joked about buying private islands, while others mentioned paying off debt, investing in businesses, or donating to charity.Yet, not everyone supports the lofty vision. Some community members urged caution, pointing out the implausibility of a $1,000 XRP under current global market conditions. At that valuation, XRP alone would surpass the GDP of most countries.However, industry leaders like EasyA founder Dom Kwok argue that it's not unrealistic for XRP‚Äôs valuation to reach the trillions or exceed the GDP of many nations. According to him, dismissing the $1,000 outlook based on current limitations may prove short-sighted in hindsight.Uphold Clarifies: No Official PredictionWhile many interpret Uphold‚Äôs XRP-to-$1,000 posts as price predictions, the exchange has consistently clarified that it does not issue official forecasts. Instead, it frames these posts as community engagement prompts, inviting users to imagine hypothetical future scenarios.However, the XRP Army, known for connecting dots, continues to speculate.

Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a technical analyst on X, recently shared this observation, highlighting the performance of both assets as they approach key resistance zones after completing similar breakout patterns. This has led many market watchers to assess whether these levels will hold or finally give way. The most important resistance level for #XRP and #XLM right now! pic.twitter.com/wBlrjhUoA8 ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 31, 2025 Identical Patterns and Shared Resistance In the analysis presented by Steph, XRP and XLM are seen on the weekly timeframe following near-identical falling wedge patterns . These patterns are typically considered bullish once broken to the upside, and both assets have now done exactly that. The chart reveals that both assets broke above the upper trendline of the falling wedge in July. After this breakout, each asset‚Äôs momentum appears to have stalled near notable resistance levels. XRP has reached an all-time high of $3.65 , and this level has so far held firm, stalling further upward momentum. Similarly, XLM has faced resistance around $0.51, with this ceiling capping its performance in July and preventing it from reaching a new all-time high, including XRP. Steph Is Crypto described these levels as the most important resistance for both assets, and overcoming them could open the door to significant gains for both assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Technical Implications of Resistance The resistance zones on both charts show a clear barrier that has not yet been broken decisively. For XRP, a clean break and close above this zone on the weekly chart would be viewed by many technical analysts as a confirmation of continued bullish momentum. Other prominent analysts have predicted that breaching the $3.65 level could send XRP toward double-digits . Until such a move occurs, the price could remain trapped below this level, consolidating or even retracing. XLM faces a similar scenario, where the breakout could potentially send it to a new all-time high, breaking the record it set in 2018. Legendary trader Peter Brandt recently shared bullish predictions for XLM , and if buying pressure increases, the asset could overcome this resistance and meet his expectations. For both XRP and XLM, this resistance zone is not just a technical level, but represents a psychological barrier, with traders closely watching for signs of strength or weakness.

2025-08-02 07:09:06,49423636,1754118546,XRP Market Cap Model Shows How Much Buy Order XRP Needs to Hit $90,"A new XRP market cap multiplier model shows how much buy volume would be necessary to send the XRP price soaring to $90. The model, which is still in development and its raw form, illustrates the predominant belief among XRP proponents that XRP's market cap could grow astronomically with modest capital inflows. It also shows just how powerful capital inflows can be when liquidity is limited.¬†XRP Surged to $90 with $10B in Buy OrdersPhil Kwok, the co-founder of EasyA, unveiled the tool in a recent disclosure . In a particular scenario, he used a $10 billion input to test XRP's response. Notably, at the time of the simulated buy, XRP traded at $2.97, with a total supply of 59.3 billion tokens, which put its market cap at $176.1 billion.After the tool applied the $10 billion order, XRP's price jumped to $90. This raised the market cap to $5.3 trillion, an increase of $5.2 trillion, or 2,930.3%. The model calculated a multiplier of 516x, showing that every $1 million worth of inflow could raise XRP's market cap by $516 million under the right conditions. XRP Market Cap Model XRP Market Cap Model To reach the $90 target, the order cleared out multiplier layers of the sell-side order book, beginning at $2.975 and steadily buying up liquidity at each level. This sweep continued until it consumed all available asks up to $90. The process showed how little XRP is available for sale at higher prices and how this scarcity can drive explosive price moves.Large Buy Orders with Thin Liquidity Could Catapult XRP to Higher TargetsInterestingly, Dom, a well-known analyst who studies order books closely, has pointed to this pattern for years. In late 2023, when XRP still traded below $1, he predicted that just $1 billion of buy pressure could push the price up by several dollars.¬†Dom encouraged traders to look directly at the order book depth to see how little resistance existed beyond the early price levels.Meanwhile, last December, when XRP surpassed $2, Dom pointed to the same mechanics behind the sharp price spike. He explained that thin liquidity allowed for steep, almost vertical price jumps as soon as serious buy pressure arrived.¬†The market expert noted that most XRP holders set extremely high price targets and likely won't sell even after big rallies, which only adds to the supply squeeze. He expected XRP to peak only when a flood of selling reappears.Moreover, three months back, Dom shared a real-time example that showed the multiplier model in action.

Bitcoin dominance is rising, sending pressure across the altcoin market. Analyst says August could define Ethereum‚Äôs path for the year. The crypto market is sending mixed signals. Despite earlier hopes for an altcoin season, Bitcoin dominance in this cycle is rising, which usually means trouble for small-cap altcoins. While a few altcoins might do well, the overall altcoin market has shown signs of weakness. So while broader altcoins face pressure from BTC‚Äôs dominance, altcoin leader Ethereum still has a shot to flip the script. Related: Bitcoin Dominance Hits 3-Year High But Faces Historical August-September Slump Ethereum‚Äôs Make-or-Break Test in August Analyst Benjamin Cowen said that August will be a decisive month for Ethereum. If Ethereum can break above $4,000 soon, it could trigger a strong rally by the end of the year.

The cybersecurity firm Zimperium says the so-called DoubleTrouble trojan ‚Äúhas rapidly evolved in both its distribution methods and capabilities,‚Äù and is now permeating channels on the social platform Discord. ‚ÄúIn its latest evolution, the malware has integrated several new and advanced features, significantly expanding its capabilities beyond earlier iterations. These enhancements enable more effective data theft, device manipulation, and evasion techniques. The new functionalities include: displaying malicious UI overlays to steal PIN codes or unlock patterns, comprehensive screen recording capabilities, the ability to block the opening of specific applications, and advanced keylogging functionality.‚Äù Researchers say the malware convinces users to download it by masking itself as an extension or an add-on, and it uses the Google Play icon to appear trustworthy. It also manipulates device functionality by exploiting Android‚Äôs Accessibility Services, allowing it to block legitimate banking or security apps with misleading ‚Äúsystem maintenance‚Äù prompts. In addition, the malicious software simulates user actions like taps and swipes, allowing attackers to remotely control infected devices and steal data, including passwords and banking details, with alarming precision. The trojan‚Äôs attacks are ongoing, primarily targeting users in Europe through phishing websites and Discord-hosted APKs. Specific victim counts remain unknown at time of publishing.

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM) have all seen strong rallies in recent weeks‚Äîbut the question now is whether that momentum can continue. At the same time, early buyers are turning attention to newer, lower-cap opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is gaining traction for its aggressive growth pace and expanding user base, with analysts suggesting a potential upside of 37x once it hits key listings. XRP Eyes Rebound After $3.55 High XRP‚Äôs recent climb to $3.55 was followed by a correction to $3.12, where it is currently consolidating. Despite the pullback, whale accumulation continues. Many analysts believe a breakout could occur if ETF approval rumors resurface. Price Prediction: XRP could trade between $3.00 and $4.75 in the coming weeks, with upside hinging on regulatory catalysts and volume recovery. Early-Stage Frenzy Builds Anticipation MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract speculative attention. Insider reports suggest new rounds are closing within hours, as buyers aim to lock in early allocations. Some projections place the potential ROI as high as 37x , making it one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this quarter. If momentum continues through launch and listings, the token could be the next frontier of the altcoin season. ADA Forecast Looks Strong into Protocol Launch Cardano currently trades around $0.76, still significantly below its previous all-time high. With the Midnight protocol and ecosystem updates approaching, long-term buyers are beginning to accumulate. Price Prediction: ADA could revisit the $1.00‚Äì$1.20 range in Q3, with room to move higher if network growth accelerates. Stellar Holds Steady After Rapid Climb Stellar (XLM) surged to $0.55 in July before correcting to its current level of $0.41. RSI remains neutral, showing indecision‚Äîbut some expect renewed movement if broader market sentiment improves. Price Prediction: If support holds, XLM may test the $0.48‚Äì$0.52 range, while a drop below $0.39 could open downside to $0.33. Conclusion XRP, ADA, and XLM are showing signs of stabilization after recent rallies, with traders watching key support and resistance levels. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as the breakout opportunity, with forecasts of up to 37x returns for early participants‚Äîfueling growing demand during its early stages.

2025-08-02 07:00:02,49405602,1754118002,"Bitcoin Plunge Below $115,000 Wipes Out $700M In Crypto Longs","Data shows the cryptocurrency derivatives market has seen more than $700 million in long liquidations as Bitcoin and altcoins have plummeted. Bitcoin Price Just Made A Low Under $115,000 Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market has witnessed a wave of bearish momentum during the past day as prices across the coins have declined. BTC went into the low $114,000 levels earlier in the day, but the coin has since bounced back above $115,000. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Here? 6 Key Metrics Show Market Shift The below chart shows how the asset‚Äôs recent performance has looked. Last week, BTC also dropped toward the $115,000 mark, but back then, it was able to quickly bounce back to resume sideways movement around $118,000. As such, it only remains to be seen whether the current deviation is a temporary one as well or if it‚Äôs the start of a real break away from the consolidation range. Most of the altcoins have taken a worse hit than the number one cryptocurrency during the past day, with some like Solana (SOL) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) exceeding losses of 5%. Crypto Derivatives Market Has Racked Up Large Liquidations A consequence of the market-wide volatility has been that liquidations have piled up over at the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector, according to data from CoinGlass. Below is a table that shows the numbers related to the latest market liquidations. As is visible above, a total of $804 million in cryptocurrency contracts have found liquidation during the past day. Out of these, $741 million of the contracts, equivalent to 92% of the total, were longs. Ethereum (ETH) led the derivatives flush with $250 million in liquidations, Bitcoin followed at $200 million. ETH topping the sector in this metric over BTC is likely a combination of two factors: its price has seen a steeper decline in the last 24 hours and speculative interest around it has been elevated due to the earlier breakout. Signs were already there that a volatile liquidation event may be coming. As this chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn on Wednesday shows, the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest was sharply climbing.

2025-08-02 06:55:11,49405435,1754117711,Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer‚Äôs Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Bitdeer‚Äôs Remarkable 63.1 BTC Weekly Success The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and few areas capture attention quite like Bitcoin mining . It‚Äôs the engine that powers the entire Bitcoin network, creating new coins and validating transactions. Recently, a significant player in this space, Bitdeer, shared some exciting news that highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset accumulation. This development offers a fascinating glimpse into the operations of large-scale miners and their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. Bitdeer, a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) cloud mining company, recently announced via X that it successfully mined a total of 63.1 BTC over the past week. This achievement not only demonstrates their operational efficiency but also provides valuable insight into their strategic asset management. The firm also sold 26.8 BTC during the same period, indicating a thoughtful approach to balancing liquidity with long-term holdings. Consequently, Bitdeer‚Äôs pure holdings have increased by 36.4 BTC, bringing their total to an impressive 1,637.8 BTC. This growth underscores the ongoing profitability and strategic importance of professional Bitcoin mining operations. What is Bitcoin Mining and How Does Bitdeer Excel? For those new to the crypto world, you might be wondering: what exactly is Bitcoin mining ? At its core, it is the process by which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation, and new transactions are added to the blockchain. This process involves powerful computers solving complex computational puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. It‚Äôs a critical function that ensures the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Bitdeer operates primarily as a cloud mining service. What does this mean? Instead of individuals buying and maintaining expensive mining hardware, they can purchase ‚Äòhash rate‚Äô from companies like Bitdeer. This allows them to participate in Bitcoin mining without the complexities of managing equipment, electricity costs, or cooling systems. Bitdeer leverages its vast infrastructure, advanced mining rigs, and optimized energy solutions to perform mining operations on a large scale. Their expertise in managing these complex systems allows them to achieve consistent mining outputs, as evidenced by their recent 63.1 BTC weekly haul. This model democratizes access to mining while centralizing the operational heavy lifting. Bitdeer‚Äôs Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: A Deep Dive into Growth Bitdeer‚Äôs recent report isn‚Äôt just about the quantity of Bitcoin mined; it also reveals a strategic approach to managing their digital assets. Mining 63.1 BTC in a week is a significant feat, but their decision to sell 26.8 BTC alongside this achievement provides a clearer picture of their operational strategy. This balancing act of accumulating new assets while liquidating a portion can be crucial for covering operational expenses, reinvesting in infrastructure, or managing market exposure. It reflects a sophisticated financial management strategy typical of large-scale crypto enterprises. The net increase of 36.4 BTC to their pure holdings, bringing the total to 1,637.8 BTC, demonstrates a clear long-term accumulation strategy. This indicates confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs future value and a commitment to growing their digital asset reserves. Understanding these movements is key to appreciating the financial health and strategic direction of a major Bitcoin mining entity. Let‚Äôs look at a simplified breakdown of their recent activity: Activity Amount (BTC) Impact on Holdings BTC Mined This Week 63.1 Increase BTC Sold This Week 26.8 Decrease Net Increase in Holdings 36.4 Positive Current Total Holdings 1,637.8 Accumulated This table illustrates the company‚Äôs dynamic management of its mined assets, highlighting a strategy that balances immediate needs with long-term accumulation. Such transparency from a major player like Bitdeer offers valuable data points for market analysts and investors. The Broader Impact of Robust Bitcoin Mining Operations The consistent success of large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Bitdeer has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Firstly, it contributes to the overall security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. The more miners there are, and the more robust their operations, the more secure the network becomes against potential attacks. Secondly, their operational scale influences the market dynamics. While mining introduces new supply, the strategic holding patterns of major miners can also impact market sentiment and available supply for trading. Furthermore, the growth of companies like Bitdeer drives innovation in the mining sector. This includes advancements in energy efficiency, the development of more powerful mining hardware, and the exploration of sustainable energy sources for mining. As the industry matures, the focus on environmental impact becomes more pronounced, pushing miners towards greener solutions. Bitdeer, like many other large players, is increasingly investing in renewable energy projects to power their operations, aligning with global sustainability goals. This shift is vital for the long-term viability and public perception of Bitcoin mining . The profitability of Bitcoin mining is also closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, as well as the network‚Äôs difficulty adjustment and the block reward halving events. With the recent halving, the block reward for miners was cut in half, making operational efficiency and strategic asset management even more critical for profitability. Companies like Bitdeer, with their established infrastructure and strong financial position, are better equipped to navigate these changes compared to smaller, less capitalized operations. Their ability to continue mining and accumulating BTC post-halving speaks volumes about their resilience and long-term vision. Challenges and Opportunities in the Bitcoin Mining Landscape While the recent figures from Bitdeer paint a positive picture, the Bitcoin mining industry is not without its challenges. Volatility in Bitcoin‚Äôs price directly impacts revenue. Energy costs, regulatory changes, and increasing network difficulty are constant factors that miners must navigate. The competition is fierce, and staying ahead requires continuous investment in technology and infrastructure. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities. The drive for greater energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources are pushing the industry towards a more sustainable future. Innovation in mining hardware continues to improve profitability and reduce operational footprints. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these dynamics is key. The strength of mining operations like Bitdeer can be seen as a barometer for the health and confidence within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Their continued accumulation of BTC signals a strong belief in the asset‚Äôs long-term value, providing a layer of stability and institutional backing to the market. The transparency provided by companies like Bitdeer, sharing their mining output and holdings, helps build trust and provides valuable data for market analysis. Conclusion Bitdeer‚Äôs recent announcement of mining 63.1 BTC and increasing its pure holdings to over 1,637 BTC highlights the robust and evolving nature of the Bitcoin mining industry. It showcases not only the company‚Äôs operational strength but also its strategic approach to asset management in a dynamic market. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the role of large-scale miners like Bitdeer becomes increasingly important in securing the network, driving innovation, and shaping the supply-side economics of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. Their ongoing success is a testament to the enduring power and potential of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is cloud mining, and how does Bitdeer fit into it? Cloud mining allows individuals to participate in Bitcoin mining by renting computing power (hash rate) from a mining farm like Bitdeer, rather than owning and operating their own hardware. Bitdeer provides the infrastructure and expertise for large-scale mining operations. Q2: Why did Bitdeer sell some of the Bitcoin they mined? Selling a portion of mined Bitcoin is a common strategic move for mining companies. It helps cover operational costs, invest in new equipment, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market prices while still accumulating a net increase in their holdings. Q3: How does Bitcoin mining impact the Bitcoin network? Bitcoin mining is crucial for the network‚Äôs security and functionality. Miners validate transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new bitcoins. This process maintains the integrity and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Q4: What are the main challenges for Bitcoin mining companies today? Key challenges include the volatile price of Bitcoin, rising energy costs, increasing network difficulty (making mining harder), and evolving regulatory landscapes. The recent Bitcoin halving also significantly reduced block rewards, increasing pressure on profitability. Q5: How does Bitdeer‚Äôs accumulation of BTC affect the market? When large entities like Bitdeer accumulate significant amounts of BTC, it can signal long-term confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs value. Their strategic holding patterns can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially influencing market dynamics and sentiment. Q6: Is Bitcoin mining becoming more environmentally friendly? Yes, there is a growing trend towards more sustainable Bitcoin mining. Many large mining operations, including Bitdeer, are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources like hydro, solar, and wind power to reduce their carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency.

2025-08-01 20:49:55,49380747,1754081395,"Trump fired BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a weak July jobs report showed only 73,000 jobs added","Donald Trump has fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, today, accusing her of distorting employment numbers in some plot to set him up. The accusation came just hours after a new jobs report revealed a steep drop in hiring over the past three months. Trump claimed the data was manipulated to make him and Republicans look weak. ‚ÄúWe need accurate Jobs Numbers,‚Äù he wrote on Truth Social. ‚ÄúShe will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can‚Äôt be manipulated for political purposes.‚Äù Trump also accused McEntarfer of sabotaging his 2024 re-election bid by publishing strong jobs growth numbers just before the election and quietly revising them downward shortly after. ‚ÄúIn my opinion, today‚Äôs Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,‚Äù Trump wrote . ‚ÄúJust like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were ‚Äòtaken away‚Äô on November 15, 2024‚Ä¶ A TOTAL SCAM.‚Äù Trump replaces McEntarfer after weak July jobs numbers The BLS reported Friday morning that the economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, far lower than what analysts had forecasted. On top of that, the agency revised May and June numbers downward by more than 200,000 jobs combined. McEntarfer‚Äôs removal came just hours after the release. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer confirmed that Bill Wiatrowski, a longtime BLS official who served under Obama, would become acting commissioner. Chavez-DeRemer said the department would begin looking for a permanent replacement immediately. She added, ‚Äúour jobs numbers must be fair, accurate, and never manipulated for political purposes.‚Äù McEntarfer had only been in the position since early 2024. President Joe Biden nominated her in July 2023, and the Senate confirmed her with an 86-8 vote in January 2024. Among the Republicans who backed her was JD Vance, who is now Vice President. Before her BLS role, McEntarfer had worked in the Census Bureau, Treasury Department, and on the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Trump claimed, without giving proof of course, that she ‚Äúfaked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala‚Äôs chances of Victory.‚Äù Trump previously celebrated the BLS‚Äôs reporting when the numbers worked in his favor. In March, while speaking from the Oval Office, he pointed to ‚Äúhow good some of these numbers are.‚Äù In April and May, the White House released statements linking strong job growth to Trump‚Äôs leadership. In June, Trump posted ‚ÄúGREAT JOBS NUMBERS‚Äù on Truth Social after the report came out. The BLS said it regularly updates figures like job growth, GDP, and inflation due to lagging survey responses. It collects data from households and businesses via phone, mail, online forms, and field visits. Officials said these lags are normal and not signs of manipulation. But Trump didn‚Äôt accept that explanation. He cited the 818,000-job correction made in August 2024 as proof that something was off. Julie Hatch Maxfield, who currently oversees the employment statistics division at BLS, will stay on. She joined the agency during Trump‚Äôs first term. Powell targeted again as $1.11 trillion wiped off the stock market Trump also revived his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell , referring to him again as ‚ÄúToo Late Powell.‚Äù Trump said Powell should be ‚Äúput out to pasture.‚Äù For months, Trump has pressured Powell to slash interest rates faster. But Powell has warned about moving too quickly. On Wednesday, he said, ‚ÄúIf you move too soon, you wind up maybe not getting inflation all the way fixed, and you have to come back. That‚Äôs inefficient. If you move too late, you might do unnecessary damage to the labor market.‚Äù This latest fight over jobs data landed hard on Wall Street. The U.S. stock market lost $1.11 trillion in value on Friday as stocks closed deep in the red. Analysts pointed to the weak jobs data and Fed uncertainty as major drivers. The BLS, founded to collect and report economic information, says its job is to ‚Äúmeasure labor market activity, working conditions, price changes, and productivity in the U.S. economy to support public and private decision making.‚Äù But Trump has now made it clear that he believes that process has been hijacked.

2025-08-01 20:30:36,49380064,1754080236,"Pump.fun's market share has drastically decreased, down from 88% just a month ago","The past couple of weeks have not been easy for Pump.fun. Not only did it finally host its IPO, which many now consider a failure, but it has also lost significant market share to its rival, LetsBonk, in the launchpad wars. LetsBonk has now become the preferred launchpad for degens, beating Pump.fun as well as other launchpads looking to capture mindshare. LetsBonk cornered Solana meme activity throughout July. Source: Blockworks Pump.fun has been on a downtrend since its IPO Earlier this year and throughout most of 2024, Pump.fun enjoyed being the golden child in the memespace and for good reason. It was the pioneer memecoin launchpad and notably made it easier for degens to tokenize their meme ideas. All that success may have made an IPO seem sensible, and Pump.fun also decided that one was necessary. The IPO drew significant attention, raising $500M in 23 minutes at a $4B valuation. However, Pump.fun‚Äôs revenue and its PUMP token have been on a consistent downtrend since its public sale, according to data from Blockworks. The IPO was a bold move. However, analysts suspect that the offering introduced Pump.fun to some challenges they have not handled very well. Factors that have influenced the downturn that has followed the IPO include regulatory pressure, the burden of public accountability, the community‚Äôs dissatisfaction with the platform, and above all, its rivalry with LetsBonk. The platform‚Äôs transition into a traded entity seems to also be working against it, as the grassroots community that has supported the project now feels left out and unheard. Did Pump.fun lose to LetsBonk? Some claim the game is far from over, but there are those who believe a winner of the launchpad wars has emerged, and it is not Pump.fun. Its rival, LetsBonk, currently stands more suitable to fill that position because while Pump.fun has faltered, LetsBonk raced ahead, securing 55% of Solana launchpad revenue according to data from Blockworks Research . The toppling of Pump.fun‚Äôs dominance can be attributed to LetsBonk‚Äôs uncanny ability to capture attention and inspire support from longtime chads of the memecoin space. It built its foundation on the good reputation the Bonk project has garnered in the Solana space and combined it with a product that was user-friendly design, came with innovative features designed to give back to the community and keep the community engaged. All those factors helped LetsBonk to distinguish itself as it was able to meet the growing demand for not just accessible and efficient launchpad solutions but also those that prioritized community. LetsBonk cornered Solana meme activity throughout July. Source: Blockworks As it stands, Pump.fun‚Äôs 24 hour launchpad revenue has fallen to around $231,000 while LetsBonk has crossed $1,000,000. LetsBonk also leads in launchpad volume with over $120,000,000 compared to Pump‚Äôs $12.4 million. Furthermore, the number of tokens launched on the Pump platform has drastically reduced, with less than 5,000 tokens recorded as launches in the past day, a meager figure compared to LetsBonk‚Äôs launches, which now exceed 17,000. In the meantime, other launchpads also continue to vie for market share, but none have been able to match LetsBonk‚Äôs current dominance.

2025-08-01 20:27:46,49379837,1754080066,BonkFun Overtakes PumpFun as Solana‚Äôs Top Memecoin Launchpad,"BonkFun has just flipped the script. It now claims the top spot in Solana‚Äôs memecoin launch market. Monthly revenue data shows BonkFun pulling ahead of PumpFun for the first time ever. Since January 2024, PumpFun dominated. It amassed over $800 million in fees in just one year. It ruled meme launches on Solana. But the game changed in July. From July 1 to July 31, BonkFun generated over $37 million in revenue. PumpFun claimed second place with $15 million. That‚Äôs a massive swing in market share‚Äîand in mindshare. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals the full picture. BonkFun has driven more than $540 million in trading volume across 175,000 token launches. That translates to roughly $34 million in fees. BonkFun now commands 55.2 percent of the memecoin launch market. PumpFun trails with 34.9 percent, having handled $341 million in volume. What sparked this meteoric rise? Two factors stand out. First, BonkFun rolled out stronger token incentives. Second, it launched an aggressive BONK buyback and burn program. Half of all platform fees go directly toward buying and burning BONK tokens. That deflationary mechanism has stoked demand‚Äîand given holders a clear reason to stay engaged. BREAKING: @bonk_fun has surpassed all other memecoin launchpads, including @pumpdotfun , in monthly revenue for the first time ever. pic.twitter.com/vQEAFxSo4A ‚Äî SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 1, 2025 BonkFun‚Äôs growth curve is steep. In just two months, it leapt from challenger to leader. Users flock to the platform for its lean fee structure and tangible token rewards. Communities buzz. Social channels light up with launch announcements and token airdrops. BonkFun Sparks Rapid Growth The top memecoin born on BonkFun is #USELESS. It now sits at over $300 million in market cap. The token‚Äôs success story exemplifies the platform‚Äôs power to incubate viral projects. As more teams choose BonkFun for their token launches, the ecosystem gains traction‚Äîand all participants stand to profit. Pump.fun vs LetsBONK.fun: Solana Meme-Launchpads, Successful Launches, Rugs, Volume And Trending Tokens To Watch Indeed, early adopters often reap the greatest rewards. With BonkFun‚Äôs buyback program accumulating BONK tokens daily, holders benefit from regular deflation. That makes the platform‚Äôs native token not just a governance tool, but a speculative asset in its own right. Figures speak louder than hype. Since July began, BonkFun‚Äôs $37 million in revenue more than doubles PumpFun‚Äôs $15 million. That surge highlights a broader shift in capital flows. Users now prefer platforms that align community incentives with tokenomics. BonkFun delivers on both fronts. What‚Äôs next for Solana‚Äôs memecoin scene? Expect even fiercer competition. PumpFun won‚Äôt surrender easily. It still boasts a massive user base and established launch pipeline. But it must now contend with BonkFun‚Äôs momentum, and the deflationary allure of BONK. For project teams, BonkFun presents a compelling value proposition. Fast launch times. Transparent fees. Immediate buyback support for their native tokens. For traders, it offers a steady drip of token burns that may buoy BONK‚Äôs price. PumpFun ruled the memecoin game since Jan 2024, pulling in over $800M in fees. Just in 1 year. But the game just changed. BonkFun flipped PF and is now the top token launchpad on Solana. pic.twitter.com/0m8rvUZhcq ‚Äî Kabuki (@kabukistory) July 31, 2025 The memecoin launchpad sector has entered a new era. BonkFun leads the charge with novel tokenomics and community-first incentives. PumpFun remains formidable, but it now plays catch-up. As the market evolves, one thing is clear: the earlier you dive into BonkFun, the more you stand to gain. With its buyback-driven deflation and explosive launch volume, BonkFun is set to dominate Solana‚Äôs token launch ecosystem, perhaps for months to come. Stay tuned. This race is only just beginning.

2025-08-01 20:15:10,49379258,1754079310,SUI DEX Volume Achieves Explosive $14.3 Billion Milestone,"BitcoinWorld SUI DEX Volume Achieves Explosive $14.3 Billion Milestone The world of decentralized finance, or DeFi, is constantly evolving, and every now and then, a blockchain ecosystem truly captures attention with remarkable growth. In a recent development that sent ripples through the crypto community, the SUI DEX volume reached an unprecedented $14.3 billion in July. This figure, as reported by DefiLlama, marks the highest level ever recorded for SUI‚Äôs decentralized exchanges, signaling a significant milestone for the relatively new blockchain. For those keeping a close eye on the DeFi landscape, this surge in SUI DEX volume is more than just a number; it represents a burgeoning ecosystem demonstrating its capabilities. It prompts questions about what factors contributed to this explosive growth and what it means for the future of SUI and the broader decentralized finance space. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into this fascinating development. What is Driving the Explosive SUI DEX Volume? The record-breaking $14.3 billion in SUI DEX volume during July is a testament to the increasing activity and confidence within the SUI ecosystem. SUI, a Layer 1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs, is designed for high performance, low latency, and parallel execution, making it particularly well-suited for high-throughput applications like decentralized exchanges. These inherent technical advantages lay the groundwork for robust trading environments. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for a central intermediary. This peer-to-peer model offers greater transparency, security, and control over assets. The substantial increase in SUI DEX volume indicates a growing preference among traders for the DEX experience offered on the SUI network. Several factors likely contributed to this impressive surge: Technological Efficiency: SUI‚Äôs architecture, which includes object-centric data model and parallel transaction execution, allows for extremely fast and low-cost transactions. This efficiency is crucial for high-frequency trading on DEXs, attracting users who prioritize speed and affordability. Ecosystem Expansion: July saw the launch and maturation of various DeFi protocols and applications on SUI. New DEXs, lending platforms, and yield aggregators emerged, providing more options and liquidity for users. As more projects build on SUI, the network effect strengthens, drawing in more users and capital. Liquidity Incentives and Campaigns: Many DEXs on SUI likely implemented attractive liquidity mining programs, airdrops, or trading competitions. These incentives encourage users to provide liquidity and engage in trading activities, directly boosting SUI DEX volume . Increased User Adoption: As the SUI ecosystem gains more recognition and its user-friendly interfaces improve, a wider audience is drawn to its platforms. Simplified onboarding processes and improved accessibility contribute significantly to user growth and, consequently, trading volume. Unpacking the Growth: Key Factors Behind SUI DEX Volume‚Äôs Ascent Beyond the fundamental advantages of the SUI blockchain, the specific dynamics of the market and the strategic moves within the ecosystem played a pivotal role in the dramatic increase in SUI DEX volume . Understanding these nuances provides a clearer picture of SUI‚Äôs rapid ascent in the DeFi world. Consider the following aspects that fueled this remarkable growth: Strategic Partnerships and Integrations: The SUI network has been actively forging partnerships and integrating with various service providers, wallets, and data analytics platforms. These integrations enhance the overall user experience and make it easier for new users to access and interact with SUI DEXs, contributing to higher trading activity. Community Engagement: A vibrant and active community is often a strong indicator of a healthy blockchain ecosystem. SUI‚Äôs community has been highly engaged, participating in governance, providing feedback, and promoting the network. This collective enthusiasm can drive organic growth in trading volume as more users discover and utilize SUI‚Äôs DeFi offerings. Developer Activity: A consistent influx of new developers building innovative applications on SUI signals a robust and forward-looking ecosystem. Increased developer activity leads to more sophisticated DeFi products and services, which in turn attracts more users and generates higher SUI DEX volume . Positive Market Sentiment: While the broader crypto market can be volatile, periods of positive sentiment often lead to increased trading across all chains. If July saw a general uptick in confidence or specific narratives favoring high-performance Layer 1s, SUI would naturally benefit from this broader trend, pushing its DEX volume higher. Factor Impact on SUI DEX Volume Technological Efficiency Faster, cheaper trades attract high-frequency traders. Ecosystem Expansion More trading pairs and DeFi opportunities. Liquidity Incentives Directly encourages trading and liquidity provision. User Adoption Wider user base translates to more transactions. The Impact of Surging SUI DEX Volume on the Ecosystem The record-setting SUI DEX volume is not just a statistical achievement; it has profound implications for the entire SUI ecosystem and its standing in the competitive DeFi landscape. This surge indicates a robust and maturing environment, signaling positive developments for all participants. What Does High Trading Volume Mean for SUI? A high trading volume on decentralized exchanges brings several significant benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Higher volume typically means deeper liquidity pools. This reduces slippage for traders, making large trades more efficient and attractive. It also ensures that there are always buyers and sellers available, leading to a smoother trading experience. Increased Developer Attraction: A thriving ecosystem with high user activity and liquidity is a magnet for developers. Projects looking to build innovative DeFi applications or integrate existing ones will be more inclined to choose SUI, further enriching its dApp landscape. Network Effect and Validation: The impressive SUI DEX volume validates SUI‚Äôs underlying technology and its promise of scalability and efficiency. This success can create a powerful network effect, drawing in more users, developers, and institutional interest, reinforcing SUI‚Äôs position as a serious contender in the Layer 1 space. Economic Boost: Increased trading activity can lead to higher transaction fees, which might contribute to the network‚Äôs economic sustainability and reward validators and stakers. It also signifies real-world utility and demand for the SUI token. Navigating the SUI DEX Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges While the surge in SUI DEX volume presents exciting opportunities, it‚Äôs also important for users and investors to understand the landscape, including both its potential benefits and inherent risks. Engaging with decentralized finance requires a degree of awareness and due diligence. What Opportunities Await Traders on SUI DEXs? For those looking to participate in the SUI ecosystem, the high DEX volume translates into several opportunities: Access to Diverse Assets: SUI DEXs offer a growing variety of tokens, including native SUI assets and bridged tokens, providing ample trading opportunities. Yield Farming and Liquidity Provision: Users can contribute to liquidity pools on SUI DEXs and earn a share of trading fees, often supplemented by additional token rewards from liquidity mining programs. Exploring Emerging Projects: The SUI ecosystem is still relatively young and dynamic, meaning early participants might discover promising new projects and tokens before they gain widespread attention. Are There Challenges or Risks to Consider? As with any high-growth area in crypto, challenges and risks exist: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. While high volume indicates activity, it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the risk of price fluctuations. Impermanent Loss: For liquidity providers, impermanent loss is a risk where the value of their deposited assets can decrease relative to simply holding them, due to price divergence between the pooled assets. Smart Contract Risks: While SUI‚Äôs Move language is designed for security, smart contracts are not entirely immune to bugs or exploits. Users should always be cautious when interacting with new or unaudited protocols. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact DEX operations and user participation. It is always advisable to conduct thorough research, understand the mechanisms of the DEXs you use, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The remarkable growth in SUI DEX volume is a positive sign, but informed participation remains key. The explosive growth of SUI DEX volume to $14.3 billion in July is a landmark achievement for the SUI blockchain. It underscores the network‚Äôs technical prowess, the rapid expansion of its ecosystem, and the increasing confidence of users in its decentralized finance offerings. This surge in trading activity is a powerful indicator of SUI‚Äôs potential to become a major player in the DeFi space, attracting more developers, users, and capital to its vibrant ecosystem. While opportunities abound, a clear understanding of the associated risks is crucial for anyone looking to engage with this dynamic environment. SUI‚Äôs journey is just beginning, and its ability to sustain and build upon this momentum will be fascinating to watch. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is SUI DEX volume?

2025-08-01 20:10:11,49379106,1754079011,Federal Reserve Impact: Decoding the Crucial Shift After Kugler‚Äôs Resignation,"BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve Impact: Decoding the Crucial Shift After Kugler‚Äôs Resignation The world of finance is constantly abuzz with news, but some developments carry a weight that resonates across every market, from traditional stocks to the volatile cryptocurrency space. One such piece of news recently broke, signaling a potentially significant shift in the United States‚Äô economic landscape: Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler is stepping down on August 8, months ahead of her term‚Äôs official end in January. This early departure creates a crucial opening for a new appointment, potentially reshaping the very core of US monetary policy and, by extension, the future of the crypto market. The immediate question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: what will be the true Federal Reserve Impact ? Kugler, an appointee of former U.S. President Biden, has been a key voice within the Fed‚Äôs Board of Governors. Her resignation, first reported by Watcher Guru on X, isn‚Äôt just a routine personnel change; it‚Äôs a strategic moment that could alter the delicate balance of opinions within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This committee is the powerhouse behind interest rate decisions and other critical monetary policies that directly influence economic growth, inflation, and investor sentiment. For those tracking digital assets, understanding this evolving situation is paramount, as the Fed‚Äôs actions often ripple through the crypto ecosystem in profound ways. What Does Federal Reserve Impact Mean for Policy Direction? To truly grasp the potential Federal Reserve Impact , it is essential to understand the institution‚Äôs role. The Federal Reserve, often simply called ‚Äòthe Fed,‚Äô serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary mandates are to promote maximum employment, maintain stable prices (control inflation), and ensure moderate long-term interest rates. These goals are achieved through various tools, most notably by adjusting the federal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs across the economy, and managing its balance sheet through quantitative easing or tightening. Adriana Kugler joined the Board of Governors in September 2022, bringing with her a background in economics and labor market research. As one of the seven governors, she held a permanent voting seat on the FOMC, making her voice influential in policy debates. Her departure opens a vacancy that, under normal circumstances, would be filled by the sitting president. However, with her early resignation occurring months before her term concludes and potentially coinciding with a presidential transition, the opportunity arises for President Trump to nominate her replacement should he win the upcoming election. This introduces a significant political dimension to what is typically an economic decision, potentially leading to a nominee with a different philosophical approach to monetary policy. A new appointment could shift the overall leanings of the FOMC. The committee is a mix of economists, bankers, and academics, each bringing their own perspectives on economic conditions and the appropriate policy response. The addition of a new Governor, especially one chosen by a different administration, could alter the consensus on critical issues like the pace of interest rate changes, the size of the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet, and even the approach to inflation targeting. This is why market participants are closely watching for any indication of who might be nominated, as their stance could signal a new era for monetary policy. Understanding the Fed‚Äôs Internal Balance and Future Direction The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is comprised of 12 voting members: the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and presidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks on a rotating basis. This structure ensures a diversity of regional economic perspectives, but the Board of Governors holds a consistent and significant sway. Within the FOMC, members are often characterized as either ‚Äòdovish‚Äô or ‚Äòhawkish.‚Äô A dovish stance typically favors lower interest rates and looser monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and employment, even if it means tolerating slightly higher inflation. A hawkish stance, conversely, prioritizes controlling inflation, even if it means higher interest rates and potentially slower economic growth. Governor Kugler has generally been perceived as leaning dovish, aligning with a cautious approach to rate hikes and an emphasis on labor market conditions. Her replacement could tip the scales. If a new appointee is more hawkish, the committee might lean towards a more aggressive stance on inflation, potentially leading to higher or more prolonged periods of elevated interest rates. Conversely, a similarly dovish replacement would maintain the existing balance. The political affiliation of the nominating president often influences this leaning, with Republican appointees sometimes perceived as more hawkish and Democratic appointees more dovish, though this is not always a strict rule. The balance of power within the FOMC directly dictates the future trajectory of interest rates, which are the bedrock of the global financial system. Here is a simplified look at the FOMC‚Äôs voting structure and how a change can ripple through decisions: FOMC Member Type Number of Members Influence on Policy Board of Governors 7 (including Chair) Permanent voting members, set overall direction and strategy. New York Fed President 1 Permanent voting member, executes open market operations. Other Fed Bank Presidents 4 (rotating) Contribute regional economic insights, influence debate and provide diverse viewpoints. How Could This Federal Reserve Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? The connection between the Federal Reserve‚Äôs actions and the cryptocurrency market might not always be immediately obvious, but it is undeniably strong. The overarching Federal Reserve Impact on the broader financial landscape inevitably spills over into digital assets. Here‚Äôs how: Interest Rates and Risk Appetite: Higher interest rates generally make traditional, less volatile investments like government bonds more attractive. When investors can earn a good return with minimal risk, their appetite for riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies, tends to diminish. Conversely, lower interest rates push investors towards higher-yielding, riskier assets in search of returns, often benefiting crypto. A shift in the Fed‚Äôs stance on rates, influenced by a new Governor, could therefore directly affect the flow of capital into crypto. Liquidity: The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet operations, like quantitative easing (QE) or quantitative tightening (QT), significantly impact market liquidity. QE injects money into the financial system, creating a more abundant supply of capital that can flow into various assets, including crypto. QT, on the other hand, withdraws liquidity, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions and downward pressure on asset prices. Any change in the Fed‚Äôs approach to its balance sheet, influenced by new committee members, would have a direct liquidity Federal Reserve Impact on crypto markets. Economic Stability and Sentiment: The Fed‚Äôs primary goal is to maintain economic stability. When the economy is perceived as stable and growing, investor confidence tends to be high, fostering a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô environment where speculative assets like crypto can thrive. Conversely, periods of economic uncertainty or recession, often influenced by Fed policy decisions, can lead to a ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô sentiment, prompting investors to pull out of volatile assets. The perceived hawkishness or dovishness of the Fed, especially with new appointments, can significantly shape this sentiment. Historical Correlation: We have seen clear correlations in the past. During periods of aggressive Fed rate hikes, such as in 2022, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market experienced significant downturns. Conversely, periods of lower rates and ample liquidity have often coincided with bull runs in crypto. While correlation does not always imply causation, the macro-economic environment set by the Fed is a dominant factor influencing the flow of capital globally, and crypto is no exception. Therefore, tracking who might replace Governor Kugler and their likely policy leanings is not just an academic exercise for crypto investors; it‚Äôs a practical necessity for understanding potential future market conditions. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for a significant Federal Reserve Impact , how should cryptocurrency investors prepare and react? Navigating periods of policy uncertainty requires a thoughtful and strategic approach rather than impulsive decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed and Monitor Appointments: Keep a close watch on news regarding the nomination process for Governor Kugler‚Äôs replacement. Research the economic views and past statements of any potential candidates. Understanding their likely stance on inflation, employment, and monetary policy tools will provide valuable clues about the Fed‚Äôs future direction. Analyze Economic Indicators: The Fed‚Äôs decisions are data-dependent. Pay attention to key economic reports such as inflation rates (CPI, PCE), employment figures (non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate), and GDP growth. These indicators provide insight into what the Fed might prioritize and how it might react, regardless of who is on the committee. Diversify Your Portfolio: While tempting to go all-in on one asset, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. This applies not only within your crypto portfolio (e.g., holding a mix of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins) but also across different asset classes. A diversified portfolio can help cushion the blow if one particular market segment is negatively affected by policy changes. Consider a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Short-term reactions to macro news, including Fed announcements, can be significant. However, for many investors, a long-term perspective focused on the fundamental technology and adoption of digital assets can help weather short-term fluctuations. Avoid panic selling or buying based solely on immediate news cycles. Risk Management is Key: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, not investing more than you can afford to lose, and regularly reviewing your portfolio‚Äôs exposure to different risks. Understanding your personal risk tolerance is crucial, especially during periods of increased market uncertainty driven by policy shifts. By proactively researching and applying these strategies, investors can better position themselves to navigate the potential shifts brought about by the evolving composition of the Federal Reserve and its ongoing Federal Reserve Impact on global markets. A New Chapter for the Federal Reserve and Crypto Markets The resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler on August 8 marks a pivotal moment for the US central bank and, by extension, for the global financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Her early departure creates an immediate vacancy, opening the door for a new presidential appointment that could significantly alter the internal balance of the Federal Open Market Committee. This shift holds the potential to influence the Fed‚Äôs future approach to monetary policy, particularly concerning interest rates and liquidity management. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding this evolving situation is not merely an academic exercise but a critical component of informed decision-making. The Federal Reserve Impact on liquidity, risk appetite, and overall economic sentiment directly translates into potential movements in Bitcoin and altcoin prices. As the nomination process unfolds and a new Governor takes their seat, the market will be keenly watching for signs of a shift towards more hawkish or dovish policies. Staying informed, diversifying portfolios, and maintaining a long-term perspective will be essential strategies for navigating the uncertainties that lie ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Adriana Kugler and why is her resignation significant for the Federal Reserve Impact? Adriana Kugler is a Federal Reserve Governor appointed by President Biden. Her resignation is significant because it creates an early vacancy on the Board of Governors, allowing the sitting president to nominate a replacement sooner than expected. This new appointment could alter the balance of opinions within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and influence future monetary policy decisions, impacting the overall Federal Reserve Impact on the economy. Q2: How does the Federal Reserve influence interest rates? The Federal Reserve influences interest rates primarily through the federal funds rate, which is the target rate for overnight lending between banks. By raising or lowering this target, the Fed affects borrowing costs throughout the economy, from consumer loans to business investments. These rate changes are decided by the FOMC, and the leanings of its members (dovish vs. hawkish) directly shape these decisions. Q3: What is the potential Federal Reserve Impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs price? The Federal Reserve Impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs price is often indirect but profound. Higher interest rates can make traditional investments more attractive, reducing demand for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, lower rates and increased liquidity (e.g., through quantitative easing) can encourage investment in cryptocurrencies. Changes in Fed policy can also influence overall market sentiment (risk-on/risk-off), which affects crypto valuations. Q4: What is the difference between ‚Äúdovish‚Äù and ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù Fed policies? A ‚Äúdovish‚Äù Fed policy typically favors lower interest rates and looser monetary conditions to stimulate economic growth and employment, even if it means tolerating slightly higher inflation. A ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù policy, on the other hand, prioritizes controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates and tighter monetary conditions, even if it might slow economic growth. Q5: When will a new Governor be appointed to the Federal Reserve? The timeline for a new Governor‚Äôs appointment depends on the nominating president and the Senate confirmation process. Given Governor Kugler‚Äôs resignation date of August 8 and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the appointment could occur relatively quickly if the current administration nominates a replacement, or it could be delayed until after the election results are clear and a new administration takes office in January.

2025-08-01 20:09:30,49379071,1754078970,Why The GENIUS Act May Benefit RWA Tokenization Companies The Most,"The GENIUS Act is the first major piece of crypto legislation to be passed by the United States Congress. The bill sets forth regulatory requirements for stablecoins and issuers in the US, finally allowing institutions and big banks to take advantage of these digital assets . Yet the GENIUS Act extends beyond benefiting large financial corporations. Technology companies that facilitate tokenization are now finally able to operate under regulatory frameworks provided by the GENIUS Act. For far too long, certain industries and American consumers have been left in the dark. That changes today with the GENIUS Act ‚Äì a bipartisan step forward that will provide regulatory clarity for payment stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/H44W25dJzh ‚Äî U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP (@BankingGOP) March 13, 2025 Tokenization Companies Gain Regulatory Clarity Dave Hendricks, CEO and founder of Vertalo, told Cryptonews that while the passage of the GENIUS Act provides large financial institutions with regulatory clearance to implement distributed ledger technology (DLT), the beneficiaries of the GENIUS Act are technology companies. ‚ÄúCompanies like Vertalo that enable institutions to issue and manage tokenized products and stablecoins are the real winners here,‚Äù Hendricks said. ‚ÄúWinning the stablecoin arms race will spur new investments in technology‚Äîand likely M&A‚Äîmostly to the benefit of builders, rather than to the banks, who may have to forego building in favor of buying.‚Äù While much attention has been given to big banks taking advantage of stablecoins due to the GENIUS Act , Hendricks shared that Vertalo‚Äîa real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform founded in 2017‚Äîfinally has regulatory clearance to implement DLT without fear of arbitrary enforcement actions. ‚ÄúBuilding distributed ledger technology platforms that comply with settled and emerging securities regulations as well as scale to enterprise volume is hard work and requires years of development,‚Äù Hendricks said. ‚ÄúIf banks and other financial institutions are looking for speed to market, they will likely need to look outside.‚Äù This appears to be the case. Walter Hessert, head of strategy for Paxos‚Äîthe blockchain infrastructure provider behind PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD stablecoin‚Äîtold Cryptonews that the GENIUS Act validates the company‚Äôs years of building compliant infrastructure alongside major enterprises like Stripe, Mastercard, and PayPal. ‚ÄúWe can immediately leverage our existing GENIUS-compliant stablecoins like USDG and PYUSD to serve institutional demand,‚Äù Hessert said. He elaborated that there is more to the GENIUS Act than just stablecoins, noting that it creates the regulated digital dollar infrastructure that makes large-scale RWA tokenization possible. Hessert pointed out that stablecoins serve as the essential on-chain settlement mechanism. With that piece now regulated, institutions can confidently tokenize RWAs at scale. This is a game-changer, especially for technology companies like Paxos that have already launched compliant stablecoin products . ‚ÄúBoth our Global Dollar (USDG) and PayPal USD (PYUSD) are compliant with the GENIUS Act‚Äôs requirements,‚Äù Hessert said. Today, @Visa announced support for Paxos‚Äëissued USDG and PYUSD in its stablecoin settlement offering. Honored to join forces with one of the world's leading payment innovators to shape the future of financial rails. pic.twitter.com/e3ReplVN0K ‚Äî Paxos (@Paxos) July 31, 2025 RWA Platforms and Financial Institutions Working Together A new opportunity has also come about, given the GENIUS Act‚Äôs impact on both technology companies and financial institutions. For instance, Hessert explained that for banks, the new piece of legislation is just as transformative. ‚ÄúBanks get regulatory clarity to custody digital assets and issue their own stablecoins through subsidiaries, all while leveraging existing relationships with corporate clients.‚Äù Yet Hessert noted that the real opportunity here is in partnerships. He explained that while banks have deep client relationships and regulatory expertise, tech companies have the blockchain infrastructure and compliance frameworks already built. ‚ÄúGlobal Dollar Network exemplifies this, as we‚Äôre partnering with traditional financial institutions to combine their distribution and trust with our stablecoin issuance technology,‚Äù Hessert said. ‚ÄúRather than a zero-sum game, GENIUS creates a collaborative ecosystem where banks and tech companies can focus on their respective strengths.‚Äù Florian N√∂ll, WW director at IBM LinuxONE, further told Cryptonews that the GENIUS Act allows stablecoin issuers to officially go after the retail payment business. ‚ÄúThis is because of stablecoins‚Äô high degree of transparency in settlement, that lowers risk and reduces fees to orders of magnitude compared to traditional rails. It ultimately opens the way for stablecoins to be a cash equivalent, but without using commercial bank money,‚Äù N√∂ll explained. He added that while commercial banks may be expected to respond with their own digital currencies (not necessarily stablecoins), tokenization providers would have to be involved in the process. ‚ÄúTheir role is pivotal in bridging traditional banking with the digital economy, ensuring compliance, interoperability, and operational efficiency,‚Äù N√∂ll commented. With this in mind, N√∂ll shared that IBM‚Äîincluding IBM Research‚Äîis building a tokenization framework for enterprise assets and bank money, addressing many existing technical and governance challenges. He added that IBM is offering differentiated capabilities for digital asset custody infrastructure for financial institutions looking to protect and manage the lifecycle of digital assets. Challenges To Consider While the GENIUS Act has created numerous opportunities for both technology companies and financial institutions, a number of challenges remain that may hold back progress . Ryan Zega, head of structured finance at Aptos Labs, told Cryptonews that a primary challenge is bridging the gap between on-chain networks and off-chain financial systems. Zega explained that for tokenized assets and programmable money to see broad adoption, integration with banks, custodians, and capital markets infrastructure needs to improve. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also a continuing need to educate policymakers, financial institutions, and the public on the practical benefits of this technology beyond headlines and speculation. That understanding will be key to long-term adoption,‚Äù Zega said. Hessert added that while compliant technology companies like Paxos may not face major challenges, the GENIUS Act requirements will prompt changes in how international jurisdictions look to regulate stablecoins . ‚ÄúPart of this will include incorporating the bill‚Äôs stablecoin reciprocity provision. This will allow stablecoins to become a global product and maximize their potential for both a modernized and inclusive global financial system,‚Äù Hessert said. Hendricks further stated that while technology companies involved in tokenization may benefit the most from the GENIUS Act, he believes the legislation will not be helpful for the overall crypto industry. ‚ÄúIn fact, the GENIUS Act could be seen as a step backward towards centralization. The GENIUS Act was a brilliant first move of this latest Congress if the goal was to provide cover to large financial institutions to expand their overall offerings, not just payment stablecoins,‚Äù he said.

2025-08-01 20:08:06,49379001,1754078886,Metaplanet to Raise Another $3.7 Billion for Further Bitcoin Purchases,"One of the many companies to convert to a BTC treasury has made adjustments to its already ambitious plans for accumulating the asset. The former hotel business has posted some impressive numbers since its transition, and it is maintaining this pace. The Issuance Strategy The publicly traded company, Metaplanet Inc., listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has released a notice stating that it plans to increase the total number of authorized shares (the maximum legal amount possible) that it can issue. The Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), led by the Board of Directors, has decided to amend the Articles of Incorporation, specifically related to the increase of these shares from 1.61 billion to 2.723 billion, allowing¬†for more flexible financing. Additionally, a shelf registration (the process of registering securities for future sale, usually with a governing body) was issued for Class A and B Perpetual Preferred Shares, up to ¬•277.5 billion ($1.8 billion), making a total of ¬•555 billion ($3.7 billion) in potential raise. Perpetual Preferred Shares are a type of stock that pays a fixed dividend to investors for as long as the company remains in business. It does not have a maturity date or a specific buyback date, and there are notable differences between the two classes. The former can be deemed ‚Äúsafer,‚Äù but are less flexible. Considered a higher priority, upon the firm making a profit, shareholders of this class receive payment first; however, selling them back to the issuing company is not possible. The latter can be described as ‚Äúriskier‚Äù but more flexible. As they are of lower priority, in the event of financial struggles for the organization, sales of Class B shares occur after those of Class A, with the key difference being that this class can be converted to regular shares and sold at a later stage, provided certain criteria are met. The Acquisition Strategy At the beginning of June, the company announced its plan to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, representing a significant upgrade from its initial goals at the start of 2025, which were to accrue 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, followed by 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. This is all part of the broader ‚Äú555 million plan,‚Äù cleverly in line with the current goal of raising ¬•555 billion in preferred stock. By mid-July, the corporation had achieved a 430.2% BTC yield, a key performance indicator (KPI) that reflects the percentage change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to fully diluted common shares. Naturally, as a result, the company‚Äôs market capitalization has also increased, and is currently up over 190% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of printing, according to data from Google Finance. Source: Google Finance On BitcoinTreasuries, the enterprise is currently ranked 7th with 17,132 bitcoins in its coffers, nearing the 18,430 stash of Trump Media, and with a noticeable lead over the 12,830 BTC held by Galaxy Digital Ltd. These amounts correspond to $197 billion, $212 billion, and $148 billion, respectively.

Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Saylor stated that this amount is potential, but that the company is not aiming to acquire all of Bitcoin. ‚ÄúI don't think we can get it all,‚Äù Saylor said. ‚ÄúThe 3% to 5% or 3% to 7% range isn't very much. But we don't want to get it all; we want everyone to have a share.‚Äù Related News: Donald Trump Announced He Will Fire the Head of the Statistics Bureau for ‚ÄúPublishing Bad Data‚Äù - Bitcoin Reacted Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy and currently traded on Nasdaq, owns just over 3% of the 19.9 million Bitcoins currently in circulation, or 628,791 BTC. This amount is currently worth approximately $72 billion at the current price of $114,692. The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, with the last BTC expected to be minted in 2140.

2025-08-01 20:00:45,49378839,1754078445,China accused the U.S. of using Microsoft Exchange flaws to hack its defense firms,"On Friday, China‚Äôs Cyber Security Association said the U.S. used a flaw in Microsoft‚Äôs messaging service to steal military intelligence and hit its defense industry. The group functions as a part of China‚Äôs Cyberspace Administration. It said in a Bloomberg report that American operators launched two significant cyberattacks against defense-related enterprises in China. While withholding the firms‚Äô identities, it added that the intruders exploited bugs in Microsoft‚Äôs Exchange platform to access the email infrastructure of a principal defense supplier for close to twelve months. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has often blamed Chinese government-backed groups for similar attacks. Back in 2021, what was believed to be a Chinese-led effort breached thousands of its Exchange servers. By 2023, a separate purported Chinese initiative had seized control of email accounts used by high-ranking U.S. government personnel. A later government assessment criticized Microsoft, stating the 2023 incident revealed a ‚Äúcascade of security failures.‚Äù In the previous month, Microsoft disclosed that hacking groups tied to China‚Äôs government had taken advantage of weaknesses in its SharePoint sharing service. ‚ÄúEvery nation state in the world carries out offensive cybersecurity campaigns against others,‚Äù said Jon Clay, vice president of threat intelligence at Trend Micro. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming at this point, because of the recent SharePoint vulnerability which was also reported by Cryptopolitan, that Microsoft attributed to China, they are coming out and saying, hey, the U.S. has been targeting us with exploits.‚Äù Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing had not offered an immediate response when contacted. China is using public hacking claims to pressure Taiwan In a recent analysis, Wiz.io‚Äôs strategic threat intelligence director, Ben Read, observed that Beijing has more frequently used open accusations of hacking to pressure Taiwan and influence global talks on cybersecurity. At the start of the year, the Chinese government claimed that groups based in Taiwan launched multiple attacks, despite the island‚Äôs autonomous governance. In April, Beijing alleged that three National Security Agency staffers attempted to infiltrate the Harbin Asian Winter Games networks, aiming to harvest extensive personal data. While the U.S. government frequently names and charges alleged Chinese hackers, China has historically held back from publicly accusing American operatives. SharePoint flaw targets over 90 U.S. agencies In another development, the Center for Internet Security, a nonprofit that helps state, local, tribal, and territorial governments share cyber threat information, noted this week that a newly disclosed SharePoint vulnerability has drawn the attention of in excess of ninety state and local agencies. It declined to identify the specific jurisdictions affected. ‚ÄúNone have resulted in confirmed security incidents,‚Äù said Randy Rose, the center‚Äôs vice president of security operations and intelligence, in an email statement. This month saw a surge of attacks targeting SharePoint instances with known vulnerabilities, stirring alarm across various government levels. Dutch cybersecurity firm Eye Security says about 400 organizations may have been hit by the SharePoint attacks. Federal agencies were among the targets , and new cases are surfacing every day. The U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory was also among the entities flagged by the scans. According to a lab spokesperson, the intruders attempted to compromise Fermilab‚Äôs SharePoint environment but were intercepted promptly, with no confidential or classified information exfiltrated. Initial coverage of the incident appeared via Bloomberg. The Department of Energy maintains that only a handful of its systems were impacted by the SharePoint flaw.

2025-08-01 20:00:44,49378746,1754078444,XRP Falling Wedge Pattern Identified. Analyst Says Big Price Breakout Is Coming,"Renowned crypto chart analyst XRP CAPTAIN has identified a classic falling wedge pattern on XRP‚Äôs 4-hour chart, signaling a potential bullish breakout on the horizon. According to his recent analysis, XRP is approaching a critical juncture, with a projected breakout target between $3.00 and $3.10, and possible upside momentum pushing the price beyond $3.60. This technical formation, marked by a converging downward trendline, often indicates a reversal in bearish momentum. In XRP‚Äôs case, the wedge reflects a tightening range and decreasing volatility, which typically precedes a sharp move to the upside. Bullish Technical Structure Strengthens Case for Rebound The falling wedge pattern identified by XRP CAPTAIN is considered one of the most reliable bullish reversal setups in technical analysis. It suggests that sellers are losing steam and that buyers are gradually regaining control . On-chain indicators further support this view, with recent data showing strong accumulation during price pullbacks and a decrease in selling pressure. #XRP Falling Wedge Pattern Identified. Breakout Is On The Horizon pic.twitter.com/2L5QlU4eE0 ‚Äî XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) August 1, 2025 Other technical analysts, including EGRAG Crypto and XRPunkie, have also flagged the same pattern, with consensus forming around an imminent breakout. Price action has repeatedly tested the upper boundary of the wedge, indicating growing bullish intent. A confirmed breakout above this resistance could unleash a strong upward move, with $3.60 emerging as the next logical target. XRP Price Update As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.04, following a daily high of $3.13 and a low of $2.91. Despite recent volatility, the asset has managed to hold above key psychological support at $3.00, keeping the bullish thesis intact. The current price marks a minor intraday loss of approximately 1.9%, which analysts attribute to normal market fluctuation within a consolidating wedge. Importantly, XRP remains up more than 60% from its mid-July lows, demonstrating sustained investor confidence amid broader crypto market uncertainty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Comes Next: Key Levels to Watch Should XRP break above the wedge resistance around $3.10 with significant volume, technical projections suggest a swift rally toward $3.50. From there, extended targets between $4.00 and $5.00 are possible, particularly if market sentiment improves and institutional demand increases, fueled by ongoing XRP ETF discussions and Ripple‚Äôs expanding global footprint. On the downside, a break below $2.30‚Äì$2.25 could invalidate the pattern, placing support near $2.10 as a key defense zone. However, most indicators currently favor a bullish resolution. With XRP hovering near breakout territory and momentum quietly building, the next few trading sessions could prove pivotal. If price breaks through with volume, it may confirm what traders have been anticipating: XRP‚Äôs next major leg up has begun . For now, all eyes are on the $3.10 level. A decisive move above it could mark the beginning of a significant price surge, validating the bullish wedge setup and propelling XRP toward new 2025 highs.

2025-08-01 20:00:34,49379684,1754078434,"Live Bets, Local Deals, and 300% Bonuses ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why Spartans Beats Betsson and DraftKings in Every Category That Matters","In a market flooded with promotions, partnerships, and platform promises, only a few betting sites are competing where it truly matters: transparency, functionality, and user-first design. Betsson has just entered Brazil with a localized platform tailored to regulatory compliance. DraftKings, meanwhile, is doubling down on live betting technology and Jackpocket integration to drive U.S. market share. Both are making smart moves, but for crypto-native bettors, neither platform checks all the boxes. Spartans does. With instant crypto payouts, 5,963 games, sportsbook access across every major league, and a 300% welcome bonus that‚Äôs clearly stated up front, Spartans blends scale, speed, and fairness in a way others don‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre comparing serious picks for the best betting website, Spartans doesn‚Äôt just compete, it wins across the board. DraftKings: Live Betting With a Wall Street Twist DraftKings remains one of the most recognizable names in digital sports entertainment. Backed by its NASDAQ listing and investor optimism, it recently reaffirmed a $46 price target from Bernstein, with analysts citing its advanced live betting capabilities and growth in average revenue per user. Much of that momentum is credited to the company‚Äôs acquisition of SimpleBet, a move that has improved DraftKings‚Äô real-time pricing and positioned it to lead the in-play wagering segment in the U.S. Another rising pillar for DraftKings is its integration of Jackpocket, a digital lottery courier. The goal is clear: cross-sell lottery products to sports bettors and vice versa, increasing lifetime value. In terms of product variety, DraftKings offers online casino games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette, alongside sportsbook access and daily fantasy sports. Still, it‚Äôs not without friction. DraftKings remains a fiat-dominated ecosystem with long withdrawal times and regional restrictions. Bonus structures can vary by state, and the fine print on promotions often requires a deep dive. For crypto users looking for instant settlement and borderless access, DraftKings may not be the best betting website just yet. Betsson: Local Compliance, Global Growth Betsson is playing the long game in rising markets. Its recent move into Brazil via a local partnership marks a major step in its South American strategy. With operations already running in Colombia and Argentina, Betsson‚Äôs approach emphasizes regulation-first expansion, supported by localized platforms offering sports betting, casino games, and virtual sports. The company has also launched a responsible gambling initiative in Brazil, including educational programs and social campaigns to reinforce safe gaming behavior. Industry analysts have praised Betsson for this approach, viewing it as a potential blueprint for how foreign operators can enter sensitive new markets ethically. However, while Betsson is building trust and infrastructure, the platform still caters more to regional fiat players than to global crypto users. Withdrawals can take time, and the bonus terms, while legally compliant, are often vague until after signup. There‚Äôs also limited visibility on RTP (Return to Player) data and game fairness mechanics, which many crypto-savvy users prioritize. Despite its strong regional foothold, Betsson hasn‚Äôt yet changed into the best betting website for players seeking speed, clarity, and crypto integration. Spartans: Crypto Clarity, Instant Access, and 5,963 Games That Just Work Spartans wasn‚Äôt built to be a legacy brand,it was built to solve the problems that legacy platforms still haven‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why crypto players are flocking to it. With 5,963 casino games, an integrated sportsbook covering everything from EPL to UFC, and a system that delivers instant crypto payouts, Spartans is designed for bettors who want speed, value, and transparency. The 300% welcome bonus is fully detailed before you deposit. Players know the 35x wagering requirement, the 7-day bonus window, and the maximum cashout amount right from the start ‚Äî no shifting terms, no buried conditions. Unlike DraftKings and Betsson, Spartans applies these terms consistently across regions, making it ideal for global users. And then there‚Äôs performance. Withdrawals in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT are processed instantly. Game fairness is supported by published RTP data and provably fair mechanics. Whether you‚Äôre spinning slots, hitting the blackjack tables, or betting live on your favorite team, the experience is seamless and consistent. Spartans also isn‚Äôt just about the games. It includes features that legacy sites overlook: mobile-first access without app installs, a transparent affiliate program (CPA, Rev Share, Hybrid), and even a Lamborghini giveaway for top-tier players. For anyone evaluating the best betting website, not based on name recognition, but on user value, Spartans delivers everything others are still promising. The Bottom Line Betsson is betting big on localization. DraftKings is doubling down on live betting and lottery integration. Both are making smart plays ‚Äî but they‚Äôre still locked into traditional models that leave gaps in speed, transparency, and crypto access. Spartans fills those gaps and then some. With over 5,900 games, a sportsbook that‚Äôs actually global, and bonus terms that are fully upfront, Spartans proves that being the best betting website isn‚Äôt about legacy ‚Äî it‚Äôs about execution. Add instant crypto withdrawals and provably fair games, and there‚Äôs no contest. For users who want betting to be fast, fair, and future-proof, Spartans isn‚Äôt just an alternative ‚Äî it‚Äôs the upgrade.

2025-08-01 20:00:20,49378690,1754078420,Bitcoin Price Plummets Toward $113K as Total Liquidations Approach $1 Billion,"The cryptocurrency markets continue bleeding out today. Bitcoin‚Äôs price dropped to a low of slightly above $113,000 while the majority of altcoins are having it much worse, as it‚Äôs almost always the case. As seen in the chart below, the price has been in a freefall since wicking to $118,000 on July 31st and has shed more than $5,000 since. Source: TradingView Data from Coinglass shows that the total liquidations for the past 24 hours have surpassed $900 million, up more than 300% since yesterday, highlighting the severity of the move. Naturally, long traders took the bigger hit, accounting for more or less $800 million of the total. Interestingly, ETH is leading the pack in liquidations with around $300 million, at the time of this writing. As CryptoPotato reported earlier, the downturn comes amid severe turbulence in international geopolitics and macroeconomics as Donald Trump continues with his tariffs policy. He imposed an additional 10% tariffs on Canadian goods and slammed 10% on goods imported from every country, aside from the countries that are subjected to higher tariffs. The drop is not isolated to crypto markets. The S&P 500 is down 1.5% today, the NASDAQ Composite lost 2.16%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also lost 1.2%.

2025-08-01 20:00:16,49379683,1754078416,"Shiba Inu Eyes $0.00001771, Injective Targets $25, But BlockDAG Delivers Full Access & 3,025% ROI Potential Before August 11!","Volatility has not disappeared; it has simply shifted. Shiba Inu is locked in a battle near $0.00001771 following a 6% daily drop, with bulls trying to reclaim control. The price prediction now depends on whether momentum returns or support levels crack under pressure. Injective is in a similar position. After a sharp run-up, the next move hinges on holding above $16. A clean breakout could push INJ toward its $25 target, but resistance still looms large on the chart. While these tokens test the limits, BlockDAG (BDAG) is following a very different path. With $358 million raised and over 200,000 holders already in, its BEAT VESTING pass gives early participants full liquidity on launch day. That kind of access, paired with a 3,025% ROI window, puts BlockDAG ahead of the waiting game. Shiba Inu Price Holds $0.0000133 as Bulls Eye August Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) is battling near the $0.0000133 support level after falling 6% in a single day. Despite gaining 16% over the past month, short-term momentum has cooled, with the token now trading below its 50-period moving average. The path forward hinges on whether bulls can reignite momentum and reclaim lost ground. Forecasts from CoinCodex place SHIB around $0.00001420 in early August, with a potential rise to $0.00001771 if volume returns. While the surge in SHIB‚Äôs burn rate supports long-term supply reduction, bearish signals are still weighing on the near-term outlook. INJ Approaches Breakout Zone With $25 Price Target in Sight Injective (INJ) has surged 40% since late June, peaking at $16.35 before cooling to $14.70. The token is now testing key resistance at $16.20, a level analysts say could open the door to higher targets. The formation of an ascending triangle adds strength to the bullish case. If INJ reclaims the $16 zone with conviction, the next move could bring prices to $25 and potentially higher. Analysts point to $26.36 and $34.32 as extended targets, with some calling for $41 if momentum continues. A drop below $12 would put that scenario on hold. BEAT VESTING Pass Ends August 4: BlockDAG‚Äôs Shortcut to Full Launch Day Access BlockDAG‚Äôs presale is not just making headlines for its $358 million raise and 24.6 billion coins sold. It is setting a new standard for early participation. With 28 batches completed and the GLOBAL LAUNCH release price fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, the stage is set for a 3,025% return when BDAG lists at $0.05. But a powerful upgrade is still available for those who want complete access right from the start. The BEAT VESTING Pass offers just that. Instead of waiting for coin allocations to unlock gradually, pass holders receive 100% of their BDAG on day one. That means the ability to trade, take gains, or reinvest without delay while the rest of the market is still stuck in a vesting schedule. It is a clear edge during the most volatile and opportunity-filled phase of a new listing. With over 2.5 million mobile miners, 200,000 holders, and 4,500 builders powering more than 300 projects, BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem is already gaining serious traction. Every new milestone adds pressure to the limited supply available under BEAT VESTING. This offer expires on August 4. As more users lock in their allocations, flexibility becomes scarce. For those looking to lead the market instead of chasing it, BEAT VESTING is the clearest way forward. Key Points Market sentiment remains divided, with Shiba Inu trading in a tight range and relying on renewed momentum to push past $0.00001771. Injective‚Äôs upside depends on buyers defending the $16 level, a move that could open the path toward $25 and beyond. Both still rely heavily on technical triggers. BlockDAG, by contrast, is offering something far more structured. Its BEAT VESTING pass allows full access to BDAG on launch day, turning early entry into a real advantage. With a 3,025% gain window still active, BlockDAG is shaping up as the smart, early-mover choice in a market full of reactive plays.

2025-08-01 20:00:03,49379681,1754078403,Solana CME Futures and Open Interest See Blowout Growth in July,"According to recent reports , the trading volume for Solana CME futures and open interest shot up dramatically in July. Recent data revealed that total Solana CME futures volume reached $8.1 billion, which is a 252% increase from June‚Äôs $2.3 billion. This surge marks the highest activity for SOL CME futures since they started trading in March 2025. The Surge Signifies Institutional Confidence in Solana Similarly, the open interest for Solana CME futures reached an average of $400.9 million, a 203% increase from June‚Äôs average of $132.3 million. Open interest shows the total value of active futures contracts. This sharp increase in trading volume and open interest reveals that institutional traders are becoming more confident in Solana. Notably, CME Group has expanded its crypto derivatives market beyond just Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The launch of Solana futures demonstrates that asset managers, hedge funds, and trading firms are seeking additional options for investing in various cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the trading volume for CME‚Äôs Bitcoin futures reached $275.3 billion in July, a 23% increase from the previous month. Average open interest also rose by 8.5% to $17.8 billion. For CME‚Äôs Ethereum futures, the trading volume surged 82% to $118.1 billion, and average open interest increased by 75% to $5.2 billion. CME Group Launches SOL Futures When the CME Group launched SOL futures in February, it was to provide investors with a way to trade Solana‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the asset. It is worth noting that these futures are settled in cash and are usually presented in two sizes. The standard contracts are equivalent to 500 SOL, while the micro contracts are only 25 SOL. The CME CF SOL-Dollar Reference serves as the backing for these prices. It presents a daily reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of Solana, usually calculated at 4:00 p.m. London time. Recall that StoneX and FalconX Digital also joined CME Group to facilitate its efforts to help institutions gain access to cryptocurrencies. In March, the digital asset broker executed the first-ever block trade of CME Group‚Äôs newly launched SOL futures product with StoneX. Future Spot Solana ETFs It is worth noting that several investment firms have moved in on SOL exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Franklin Templeton, a major asset manager , recently became the largest firm to file for a Solana ETF. VanEck and 21Shares also submitted applications, with VanEck being the first to apply to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Intriguingly, the United States‚Äô first Solana staking ETF has made a confident market entry, signaling growing interest in crypto staking-enabled ETFs among institutional investors. Solana CME futures also showed record demand following the ETF debut.

2025-08-01 19:55:10,49378484,1754078110,Curve DAO Layer-2: A Crucial Rethink of DeFi Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Curve DAO Layer-2: A Crucial Rethink of DeFi Strategy The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape is a dynamic realm, constantly evolving with new innovations and strategic pivots. At the heart of this evolution are protocols like Curve DAO, a cornerstone of stablecoin liquidity. Recently, a significant discussion has emerged within the Curve DAO community, sparking a crucial rethink of its Curve DAO Layer-2 strategy. This internal debate underscores the complex realities of scaling DeFi and the constant pursuit of efficiency and sustainability. Why is Curve DAO Now Rethinking its Crucial Layer-2 Strategy? A pivotal moment for Curve DAO arrived with a proposal from community member ‚ÄúPhil_00LLAMA.‚Äù This proposal, detailed in a report by Protos, suggests a significant shift: ceasing further development work on Curve DAO Layer-2 network integrations. The core argument is straightforward yet profound: these Layer-2 deployments are currently generating minimal network fees when compared to the robust activity and fee generation on the Ethereum mainnet. For a protocol like Curve, which facilitates high-volume, low-margin stablecoin swaps, the economics of operation are paramount. Every integration, every bridge, and every deployment incurs development, maintenance, and opportunity costs. If the return on investment in terms of fees is not substantial, then questions naturally arise about the efficiency of such expansion. This isn‚Äôt just a technical discussion about scaling; it‚Äôs an economic evaluation of where resources are best allocated to ensure the long-term health and profitability of the Curve DAO ecosystem. The proposal highlights a growing sentiment among some community members that while Layer-2 solutions offer scalability and lower transaction costs for users, they may not always translate into significant revenue streams for the protocols themselves, especially when liquidity becomes fragmented across many chains. This critical assessment of the Curve DAO Layer-2 approach is a testament to the community-driven nature of decentralized governance, where financial prudence is as important as technological advancement. Are Curve DAO Layer-2 Integrations Truly Profitable? The Hard Numbers. The central contention of the proposal revolves around the economic viability of current Curve DAO Layer-2 deployments. While Layer-2s excel at reducing user transaction fees and increasing throughput, the cumulative fees generated for the protocol often pale in comparison to those earned on the Ethereum mainnet. This disparity forces a re-evaluation of the strategic value of spreading liquidity across multiple chains. To illustrate this point, consider a simplified comparison of hypothetical fee generation: Parameter Ethereum Mainnet Typical Layer-2 (e.g., Optimism/Arbitrum) Transaction Volume (Hypothetical Daily) High Moderate to High Protocol Fee per Swap Standard Curve Fee Standard Curve Fee Gas Costs (User Perspective) High Low Cumulative Protocol Fees (Hypothetical) Significant Relatively Lower Liquidity Concentration High Fragmented This table highlights that while Layer-2s reduce user costs, the aggregate revenue for the protocol might not be as lucrative as maintaining a strong presence on the mainnet. The operational overhead of supporting multiple deployments, including bridge maintenance, security audits, and community support across different chains, adds to the cost. This rigorous financial scrutiny is essential for any decentralized autonomous organization aiming for long-term sustainability and growth in its Curve DAO Layer-2 strategy. What Happens Next? The Wider Impact of Curve DAO Layer-2 Decisions. Should the Curve DAO community vote to scale back its Curve DAO Layer-2 expansion, the implications would ripple throughout the DeFi ecosystem. Firstly, for Curve DAO itself, this could mean a more concentrated revenue stream, potentially leading to increased efficiency in its treasury management and a clearer focus on its core operations on the Ethereum mainnet. It could also free up development resources to focus on other strategic initiatives, such as new product offerings or mainnet optimizations. For existing Layer-2 networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, a major protocol like Curve rethinking its strategy could prompt their own re-evaluations. These L2s strive to attract leading DeFi protocols to bolster their ecosystems, liquidity, and user base. A reduced commitment from Curve might necessitate new incentives or different approaches to attract and retain other flagship projects. It could also influence how other protocols perceive the long-term economic benefits of deploying on various Layer-2s. From a user perspective, a shift in Curve DAO Layer-2 strategy could lead to a greater centralization of liquidity on the mainnet. While this might mean higher gas fees for some transactions, it could also result in deeper liquidity pools and potentially better swap rates due to less fragmentation. It‚Äôs a trade-off between accessibility and efficiency, and the community‚Äôs decision will ultimately shape this balance. This development also sets a significant precedent for the broader DeFi space. As more protocols mature, they will inevitably face similar questions about the economic sustainability of their multi-chain strategies. Curve DAO‚Äôs transparent and community-driven approach to this challenge offers valuable insights into how decentralized organizations can adapt to changing market dynamics and prioritize long-term value creation over rapid, potentially unsustainable, expansion. Beyond Layer-2: What Are the Strategic Alternatives for Curve DAO? If the community decides to pull back from extensive Curve DAO Layer-2 integrations, what strategic alternatives could Curve pursue? The debate itself opens doors to innovative thinking and a renewed focus on core strengths. Here are a few potential paths: Mainnet Consolidation: Curve could double down on its dominance on the Ethereum mainnet. This involves optimizing existing pools, exploring new stablecoin pairs, and enhancing user experience where the vast majority of its fee generation currently occurs. By concentrating liquidity, Curve could further solidify its position as the premier stablecoin swap platform. Selective L2 Engagement: Instead of broad expansion, Curve might adopt a more selective approach to Layer-2s. This could mean focusing only on those L2s that demonstrate significant, sustained user activity and fee generation, or those that offer unique strategic advantages, such as specific institutional partnerships or niche user bases. Interoperability Solutions: Rather than native deployments on every L2, Curve could explore more robust cross-chain interoperability solutions that allow liquidity to flow seamlessly without requiring full protocol deployments on each chain. This could reduce operational overhead while still offering users access to diverse liquidity. New Product Development: With resources potentially freed from L2 development, Curve DAO could invest in new product lines or features that enhance its core offerings or expand into adjacent DeFi verticals. This could include new types of stablecoin pools, yield-bearing assets, or innovative liquidity solutions. Enhanced Governance Mechanisms: The current debate highlights the power of community proposals. Strengthening governance mechanisms to allow for more agile and data-driven decision-making on resource allocation could be another strategic focus. This ensures that the Curve DAO Layer-2 strategy, or any future strategy, remains aligned with community sentiment and economic realities. These alternatives underscore the adaptive nature of decentralized finance. The ability of a DAO to pivot its strategy based on real-world data and community consensus is a significant strength, ensuring its resilience and long-term relevance in a rapidly evolving market. A Bold Step for Decentralized Finance The ongoing discussion within the Curve DAO community regarding its Curve DAO Layer-2 integrations is more than just an internal debate; it‚Äôs a critical examination of sustainable growth in the decentralized finance space. By questioning the economic viability of broad Layer-2 expansion, Curve DAO is taking a bold step towards prioritizing efficiency and revenue generation over mere presence across multiple chains. This strategic pivot, driven by community consensus and grounded in financial reality, could redefine how leading protocols approach multi-chain expansion. It serves as a powerful reminder that in the world of DeFi, adaptation, rigorous economic analysis, and decentralized governance are key to navigating the complexities of a constantly evolving landscape. The outcome of this proposal will undoubtedly influence the future direction of Curve DAO and provide valuable lessons for the entire blockchain ecosystem. The Curve DAO community debates the future of its Layer-2 strategy. Curve DAO Layer-2: A Crucial Rethink of DeFi Strategy Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Curve DAO? Curve DAO is the decentralized autonomous organization governing the Curve Finance protocol. Curve Finance is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) primarily focused on efficient stablecoin swaps and other pegged assets, known for its deep liquidity and low slippage. What are Layer-2 networks in the context of DeFi? Layer-2 networks are scaling solutions built on top of a blockchain (like Ethereum) to increase transaction throughput and reduce gas fees. They process transactions off the mainnet but periodically submit proofs back to the mainnet for security and finality. Examples include Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Why is Curve DAO reconsidering its Layer-2 integrations? Curve DAO is reconsidering its Layer-2 integrations primarily because a community proposal argues that these deployments generate minimal network fees for the protocol compared to the Ethereum mainnet, making their continued development and maintenance economically inefficient. What is the significance of network fees for DeFi protocols like Curve? Network fees are crucial for DeFi protocols as they often constitute a primary revenue stream. These fees can be used to fund operations, reward liquidity providers, or buy back and burn native tokens, contributing to the protocol‚Äôs sustainability and value proposition. How might a change in Curve DAO Layer-2 strategy impact DeFi users? A shift could lead to more concentrated liquidity on the Ethereum mainnet, potentially offering deeper pools and better swap rates there. However, it might also mean higher gas fees for users who prefer to transact on Layer-2s, depending on how Curve adjusts its presence on various chains. What role do community proposals play in DAOs? Community proposals are fundamental to the governance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). They allow token holders to suggest, debate, and vote on significant changes to the protocol‚Äôs operations, treasury management, and strategic direction, ensuring decentralized decision-making.

2025-08-01 19:49:19,49378296,1754077759,How Telegram Growth and Staking Drove FUNToken‚Äôs Price Surge Since April,"While many gaming tokens struggled to stay relevant this year, FUNToken ($FUN) has delivered one of the most consistent rallies in the Web3 sector. Trading around $0.0195 at the time of writing, FUN has nearly tripled since early April, when it traded between $0.005 and $0.007, according to CoinMarketCap. This surge was not the result of hype alone. Two powerful forces - the expansion of the Telegram ecosystem and the preparation for staking - worked together to drive adoption, reduce supply, and build trust across the community. Here‚Äôs a look at how these two pillars fueled FUNToken‚Äôs impressive climb. Understanding the Price Trend Since April Before we explore the drivers, it helps to see how the rally unfolded: Early April: Trading between $0.005‚Äì$0.007, as early adopters accumulated tokens and awareness started to grow. May: Fluctuating between $0.007‚Äì$0.009, supported by the launch of new games, but without breaking above $0.010. June: Pulling back closer to $0.007, as early gains cooled and broader market sentiment softened. Early July: Gaining momentum and moving above $0.010 for the first time in this rally. Mid-July: Surging to $0.0195, driven by renewed adoption, community engagement, and the Q2 25 million token burn. This steady climb showed a clear pattern of building fundamentals rather than a single speculative spike. Telegram Growth: The Daily Engine of Adoption One of the most important drivers of this rally was the rapid expansion of FUNToken‚Äôs Telegram ecosystem. The official $FUN Telegram bot became a daily habit for over 105,000 active users, offering: Hyper-casual games where players could instantly start earning FUN rewards Missions and quests that created reasons to come back every day The Wheel of Fortune, giving users the chance to win up to $500 in tokens per spin This frictionless experience meant anyone with a Telegram account could start playing in seconds, without worrying about complex wallets or technical onboarding. Meanwhile, the official Telegram channel kept the community informed with: Daily updates about new games and features Announcements of burn events and giveaways Support for new users to get started quickly This consistent engagement turned casual players into long-term participants, driving transaction volume and reinforcing confidence in the project. Staking: Preparing for Predictable Scarcity While staking officially launches later this year, the groundwork laid in Q2 has been crucial to the rally‚Äôs momentum. Here‚Äôs why staking preparations matter so much: Backend systems were completed, connecting the FUN Wallet seamlessly to staking pools and ensuring tokens can be locked up with minimal friction. Reward structures were tested, giving early visibility into how yields will be distributed and how staking will remove tokens from circulation. The upcoming mobile FUN Wallet app was announced, with a simple, integrated staking experience designed to appeal to casual gamers as well as seasoned holders. These preparations created anticipation and confidence. As users saw staking coming online, many chose to hold or accumulate more FUN tokens rather than selling, reducing market supply and supporting upward price pressure. The $5 Million Giveaway: Strengthening Loyalty The $5 million giveaway also played an essential role in connecting Telegram growth and staking readiness. This campaign rewards users for: Holding FUN tokens Completing daily missions Referring friends into the ecosystem By incentivizing consistent participation, the giveaway made it more attractive to stay engaged and retain tokens rather than cashing out. This loyalty contributed to lower sell pressure throughout the price climb. Why These Drivers Worked Together When combined, Telegram growth, staking readiness, and community incentives created a self-reinforcing cycle that has kept FUNToken‚Äôs rally durable rather than short-lived. Here is how each piece connected: New users joined through Telegram games and missions.The simplicity of the Telegram bot made it easy for anyone to start earning tokens without complicated onboarding. As more casual gamers discovered the platform, daily participation climbed steadily. More daily activity increased transaction volume and generated revenue for burns.Every mission completed and spin played created small fees that FUNToken uses to fund quarterly buybacks. This meant community engagement directly contributed to reducing circulating supply. Anticipation of staking made holders less likely to sell.As the roadmap for the FUN Wallet app and integrated staking became clearer, more users decided to hold onto their tokens in preparation. This anticipation created a natural floor for the price and helped limit volatility. The $5 million giveaway rewarded consistent engagement.Unlike a single marketing push, the giveaway has continued month after month, offering players reasons to hold, play, and invite friends. These incentives kept activity high even when markets were uncertain. Burns and staking created predictable scarcity.As tokens were steadily removed from circulation through burns and locked away in preparation for staking, the available supply shrank. This structural scarcity supported gradual upward price pressure over time. The resulting confidence attracted even more users and investors.Each successful milestone reinforced the perception that FUNToken is delivering on its promises. As confidence grew, new users were more willing to participate, creating a virtuous cycle of adoption and price appreciation. This multi-layered dynamic is why FUNToken‚Äôs rally since April has been fundamentally different from hype-driven pumps that spike and collapse. By combining real utility, strong community engagement, and disciplined supply management, the project has laid a foundation that looks sustainable over the long term. Looking Ahead: More Catalysts on the Horizon The roadmap for Q3 and Q4 includes: Launching the FUN Wallet mobile app, with staking built in Expanding to 30 live games across platforms Hosting the Global FUN Gaming Summit to showcase innovation Ongoing quarterly burns to keep reducing supply If the team continues delivering, these milestones could strengthen the ecosystem even further. Closing Remarks FUNToken‚Äôs price surge since April has been a clear example of how utility and community can drive lasting growth. With Telegram engagement scaling, staking around the corner, and a transparent roadmap in place, FUNToken is showing how a gaming token can evolve into a sustainable, vibrant ecosystem - one daily mission and burn at a time.

The prospective investments from the Alphabet subsidiary, CapitalG, and Nvidia could raise VAST Data‚Äôs valuation to $30 billion. Alphabet‚Äôs venture arm, CapitalG, and the semiconductor giant Nvidia are in advanced discussions to invest in VAST Data, a rapidly growing artificial intelligence infrastructure startup. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, the funding round could value VAST Data at up to $30B, making it one of the highest-valued AI startups globally. VAST Data is on track for a $30B valuation The New York-based company is reportedly raising about $5B from a mix of tech giants, private equity firms, and venture capital investors. While the final structure of the deal is still being negotiated, the round is expected to close within the next few weeks. Alphabet‚Äôs CapitalG‚Äôs interest marks the company‚Äôs entrance into AI infrastructure. Nvidia, on the other hand, would be consolidating its ties within the AI data stack as it is already a backer of VAST Data. VAST Data develops specialized storage solutions for AI data centers, allowing for high-speed data movement between GPUs (graphics processing units), primarily those manufactured by Nvidia. This capability is increasingly crucial as the demand for efficient, scalable AI training environments continues to rise. The startup‚Äôs technology has attracted key clients such as Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI and CoreWeave. Is VAST gearing up for an IPO? According to a separate source cited by Reuters, VAST Data reached $200M in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in January 2025. With a healthy order backlog, the company is projecting to triple that figure to $600M in ARR over the next year. VAST Data‚Äôs CEO, Renen Halak, has said that the company is free cash flow positive, which is rare among AI startups currently, as they have to burn through capital to sustain their rapid growth. Anyhow, the company is drawing speculation of a future public offering. Although it has not hinted at an imminent IPO, insiders have said that VAST Data is laying the groundwork. In 2023, the company appointed Amy Shapero as its first Chief Financial Officer. Shapero served as the CFO at the e-commerce giant Shopify, and her experience in scaling a company through a public listing is fanning the flames of Vast Data‚Äôs future fundraising plans. VAST Data has raised approximately $380M to date. Its most recent funding round in 2023 valued it at $9.1B. This surge in valuation is due to the increased interest in infrastructure providers such as chipmakers, cloud computing platforms, and storage specialists.

China‚Äôs CAC and US lawmakers raise concerns over tracking, geolocation, and remote shutdown features in advanced chips. Nvidia plans to resume H20 chip sales in China after US approval, balancing regulatory scrutiny from both sides. Nvidia Corporation has stated that its chips do not contain any backdoors that could provide third parties with access to devices, according to CNBC . In July, the company announced its intention to resume sales of H20 AI processors in China after receiving permission from the US government. Chinese regulators summoned representatives of the chipmaker for questioning to understand the potential risks associated with the chips. On July 31, Nvidia met with Beijing officials to discuss national security concerns. ‚ÄúCybersecurity is of the utmost importance to us. Nvidia chips do not have any ‚Äòbackdoors‚Äô that would allow someone to remotely access or control them,‚Äù a company spokesperson said in a statement on August 1. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has demanded that Nvidia provide clarifications and relevant documentation regarding security threats, including potential vulnerabilities and backdoors, in H20 chips shipped to the country. The regulator noted previous concerns about serious vulnerabilities in the American company's AI processors and pointed out that American legislators have called for mandatory tracking for the export of advanced semiconductors. CAC added that US AI experts have claimed Nvidia‚Äôs computing chips include advanced ‚Äútracking and positioning‚Äù technologies, as well as ‚Äúremote shutdown‚Äù features. In May, Republican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton and a bipartisan group of eight members of Congress introduced the U.S. Chip Security Act, which would require semiconductor companies like Nvidia to build security mechanisms and geolocation features into their advanced AI processors.

An old Bitcoin wallet, which had been inactive for 12 years, transferred 306 BTC (approximately $35.37 million) today. This ancient investor purchased the BTC in question for a total of $23,700 12 years ago, when Bitcoin was just $77. At today's prices, that investment is worth approximately 1,493 times. However, such profit-taking also creates a sense of caution among investors. Historical data shows that August and September are generally weak months for Bitcoin. In eight of the last 12 years, BTC prices have fallen during these two months. This suggests a 67% probability of a decline.

2025-08-01 19:30:23,49377520,1754076623,"Analyst Predicts Historical 90% XRP Crash Against Bitcoin, But This Will Happen First","XRP‚Äôs recent performance has been relatively strong against Bitcoin in the past month. Over the past few weeks, the XRP/BTC pair has been quietly pushing up above the 0.00002100 level and challenging long-standing horizontal resistance levels. Amid this movement, a new technical analysis from crypto analyst JayDee has stirred controversy on social media, with the suggestion that XRP may soon go on an explosive rally against Bitcoin before suffering a catastrophic 90% crash. Final Biblical Move To Send XRP/BTC Surging According to JayDee, XRP is entering the final phase of its multi-year structure against Bitcoin, and a dramatic breakout could be imminent. ‚Äú$XRP is on the verge of having its FINAL BIBLICAL MOVE against $BTC in the coming months,‚Äù he wrote. As shown in a monthly candlestick timeframe chart of the XRP/BTC pair, which the analyst shared on the social media platform X, XRP/BTC is currently sitting around a resistance zone after escaping a long-term descending triangle back in December 2024. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Teleport As Major Financial Players Tap In ‚Äî Opportunity Window Closing Fast A thick green box shown in the chart below suggests that the next move may be a rapid surge, which could see the XRP/BTC pair trade for as high as 0.00007. At the time of writing, XRP/BTC is trading at 0.00002649. Therefore, an increase to 0.00007 will represent a 164% increase from the current levels and put the pair trading at levels not seen since mid-2019. The green target zone will likely come into play once resistance at 0.00002700 is cleared with enough volume for XRP. A strong factor that could see XRP outperforming Bitcoin by such a massive amount is if Spot XRP ETFs are finally launched in the US. Supporting this view is a bullish crossover forming on the Stochastic RSI, which is circled on the chart. The momentum indicator is currently sitting just above the 60 line, which is another sign that the pair could be on the verge of a sharp move higher. Once this bullish cross is confirmed, the rally would be massive and go along the line of many traders expecting an intense upside in a short period of time. However, the expected price overperformance of XRP against Bitcoin comes with a twist; this euphoric phase won‚Äôt last long. The Predicted 90% XRP/BTC Crash Analyst JayDee warns that what comes after this final Biblical XRP/BTC move could be devastating for most XRP holders. ‚ÄúRight before HISTORICAL 90% crash that will wipe out most investors,‚Äù he added. Related Reading: XRP Price Showing Quiet Strength As Next Breakout Level Lies At $4.65 The predicted crash is shown in the chart image above with a massive blue arrow pointing downward into a pink zone located between $0.000009 and $0.000007. According to the structure, this drop would return XRP/BTC to retest its long-term ascending support trendline, which has held since 2017. A 90% crash in the XRP/BTC pair could happen if XRP experiences a severe price breakdown below $3 and $2. Alternatively, XRP could underperform and drive the ratio downward even without a sharp XRP price decline if Bitcoin regains dominance and begins setting multiple new all-time highs.

2025-08-01 09:30:19,49353221,1754040619,Four Russian oil tankers stalled off India‚Äôs coast,"Four oil tankers carrying Russia‚Äôs Urals crude are currently stranded off the coast of western India, as local refiners wait for directions from the government following new pressure from President Donald Trump. The vessels‚ÄîAchilles, Elyte, Destan, and Horae‚Äîloaded their cargo in late June, but have yet to dock, with plans disrupted by fresh sanctions and tariff threats out of Washington. According to reporting from Bloomberg , the ships are sitting off Jamnagar, close to Sikka port, which serves Reliance Industries Ltd. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. Trump‚Äôs White House announced this week that it was slapping new import duties on India in response to its continued purchase of Russian oil. That announcement came after the European Union issued another wave of penalties targeting Russia last month. The administration also warned that further penalties could follow if India doesn‚Äôt scale back those oil imports. India orders refiners to find alternatives as Trump escalates Achilles and Elyte, both Aframax-class tankers, were scheduled to discharge at Sikka on August 2 and 3. Each ship can carry around 700,000 barrels, and both loaded cargo at Primorsk and Ust Luga, key Russian export terminals. Both vessels have already been sanctioned by the EU and UK, adding further risk for Indian refiners caught in the middle. Following the announcement from Trump‚Äôs administration, New Delhi directed refiners to come up with new plans for sourcing oil. Government officials have asked the companies to share strategies for securing crude from countries not targeted by sanctions. The instruction signals that India is trying to avoid being directly hit by Trump‚Äôs unspecified future penalties. Destan and Horae, also Aframaxes, are floating farther from shore with Urals crude in their tanks. They picked up cargo between June 24 and July 1, based on ship-tracking information. Destan, like Achilles and Elyte, is under EU and UK sanctions. It‚Äôs expected to reach Sikka soon. Horae, on the other hand, has not been sanctioned by any major Western government. But its destination is still unclear, and the uncertainty surrounding Trump‚Äôs evolving position on Russia is forcing all players to stay cautious. Indian officials are watching closely to see if Washington moves to expand its sanctions framework further. The growing concern among refiners stems from Trump‚Äôs remarks delivered at the White House on Thursday afternoon. When asked about the situation, Trump said his foreign envoy, Steve Witkoff, would soon be heading to Russia. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to Russia, believe it or not,‚Äù Trump told reporters, revealing the trip publicly for the first time. Witkoff is currently in the Middle East discussing the conflict in Gaza, but Trump said the envoy will shift his focus to Moscow as part of the president‚Äôs push to end the war in Ukraine. Witkoff last visited Russia in April, when he held talks with President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. Those discussions did not result in any deal. Trump warns of more sanctions, doubts their impact Tensions have since escalated. Trump has grown frustrated with Putin and was blunt when asked about Russia‚Äôs latest attacks on Kyiv. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs disgusting what they‚Äôre doing. I think it‚Äôs disgusting,‚Äù Trump said, referring to missile and drone barrages launched by Moscow this week. He confirmed plans for new sanctions and repeated his earlier threat to impose them if Russia didn‚Äôt commit to a peace deal by the end of the week. But he also questioned how effective they would be. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre going to put sanctions,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that sanctions bother him. You know, they know about sanctions. I know better than anybody about sanctions and tariffs and everything else. I don‚Äôt know if that has any effect, but we‚Äôre going to do it.‚Äù The uncertainty around how far Trump is willing to go has left Indian refiners in a holding pattern. The four Russia-linked tankers near India now represent more than 2.8 million barrels of oil waiting for instructions. For now, the cargo remains onboard, and no final decisions have been made.

Market analysts are watching a bullish double-bottom or golden cross pattern, which could pave the way toward $0.30‚Äì$0.35, with some speculative targets reaching $0.40‚Äì$0.46 if momentum and volume hold. Resistance around $0.26‚Äì$0.27 may prove critical, breaking above it would open the door to wider upside, while failure to do so could keep DOGE trading in a sideways range.

SEI targets $0.49 as DeFi activity and support grow steadily. SUI near all-time high, boosted by upgrades and institutional investor interest. Forget the August slump the market has seen in past years as 2025 is shaping up to be a very different story. While the crypto market has been shaky, some altcoins are showing strong signs of bouncing back beneath the surface. With new upgrades, bullish charts, and growing investor attention, a few select tokens could be on the edge of something big this month. AltcoinBuzz has listed four altcoins that are showing promising price action. Solana (SOL) Could Be Gearing Up for a Breakout Solana has been trading in a relatively tight range between $130 and $200 over the past three months. Currently, SOL is priced at $170 and if it breaks through the $200 mark, SOL could make a sharp move higher.

2025-08-01 09:29:36,49354567,1754040576,Is MUTM the next Solana? Analysts target $3 by Q2 2026,"Analysts now see echoes of that same growth story in a rising DeFi project‚Äî Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While Solana disrupted Layer-1 infrastructure with raw speed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging with a new disruptive element: sustainable real yield at scale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a utility-first ecosystem. Its smart contract infrastructure is designed for scalability, and it enables users to lend, borrow, and stake with clear and predictable returns. This isn‚Äôt about inflated APRs that collapse in bear markets‚ÄîMutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing mechanisms like protocol revenue buybacks, decentralized stablecoin issuance, and a Layer-2 deployment that brings down transaction fees. These components have laid the foundation for a strong price trajectory. With its token still in Phase 6 of presale, priced at $0.035, analysts are forecasting a future price of $3 before Q2 2026. That‚Äôs an 85x from current levels. Protocol mechanics that drive adoption What‚Äôs attracting serious attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its upcoming innovative dual-model lending system. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) mechanism offers a low-risk, passive income path for users who want yield without needing to negotiate terms. For instance, a lender depositing 3 Chainlink (LINK) tokens‚Äîcurrently may then be worth around $42 each‚Äîearns approximately 12% APY, translating to about $15 in annual yield. This yield is generated from actual borrowing demand, not speculative incentives, creating a dependable return model. On the borrower side, the same platform allows users to access liquidity without losing asset exposure. A user holding $5,000 worth of USDC can secure a loan of $4,000 at an 80% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. There‚Äôs no forced repayment schedule; users repay when it suits them, while automated smart contracts handle liquidation based on a risk-adjusted Stability Factor. This makes Mutuum ideal for long-term holders of blue-chip assets looking to unlock capital. Beyond that, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending system is designed for higher-yield seekers and involves memcoins like FLOKI, TRUMP, and SHIB. It connects borrowers and lenders directly, enabling tailored deals with agreed interest rates and terms. It‚Äôs a more hands-on approach but gives participants more flexibility and the potential for outsized returns. Together, these models reflect a DeFi ecosystem that accommodates both risk-averse users and aggressive yield hunters, something that even established protocols often struggle to balance. Tokenomics, presale status & growth engine With utility locked in, attention is turning to the numbers‚Äîand they‚Äôre pointing up. The project is in Phase 6 of its presale, with the MUTM token priced at $0.035. So far, over 14,700 holders have joined the ecosystem, and 7% of the Phase 6 allocation has already been purchased. The next price jump, set at $0.040 in Phase 7, marks a 15% gain for those who act now. But the real advantage goes to early participants. Investors from Phase 1‚Äîwhen the token was just $0.01‚Äîare already sitting on a 250% unrealized gain. At a future $3 price target, that would translate to a 300x return. Even at the current Phase 6 price, the path to $3 means an 85x upside‚Äîa clear incentive for newcomers to enter before the presale concludes and exchange listings go live. Those listings are expected to include Binance, KuCoin, and MEXC, positioning the token for serious visibility across global retail and institutional investors. At launch, the listing price will be $0.06, which alone represents a 70% jump from the current $0.035 price. On top of all this, the protocol introduces a smart buy-and-distribute mechanism. Revenue earned from borrower interest is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These are then redistributed to mtTokens stakers in the smart contracts, which represent staked assets in the system. This model creates a consistent demand driver for the token while rewarding long-term participants with increasing value and yield. The project also features a $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens‚Äîa bold campaign to grow awareness and reward early believers. A separate $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK reinforces the project‚Äôs security-first approach. The audit includes manual code reviews, static analysis, and two key metrics: a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. Final words Solana succeeded by solving a core problem of blockchain speed and scalability, and early adopters were rewarded exponentially. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to replicate that trajectory, this time in the lending and borrowing arena. Its combination of real-world yield, flexible borrowing, and upcoming Layer-2 deployment has already attracted the attention of thousands. As exchange listings approach, the $0.035 presale entry point won‚Äôt last much longer. When MUTM goes live at $0.06 and starts climbing, the chance to enter early, just like Solana, it will be gone.

2025-08-01 09:25:10,49353053,1754040310,Binance Alpha Unveils Exciting Toshi (TOSHI) Addition,"BitcoinWorld Binance Alpha Unveils Exciting Toshi (TOSHI) Addition The cryptocurrency world is constantly evolving, with new projects emerging daily. For many enthusiasts, the thrill lies in discovering these early gems before they hit the mainstream. This is precisely where platforms like Binance Alpha come into play, offering a curated glimpse into the future of decentralized finance. Recently, the buzz amplified with the announcement that Binance Alpha , an innovative platform within the Binance Wallet ecosystem, has officially added Toshi (TOSHI) to its showcase. This move is more than just a new listing; it signifies a strategic step in bringing promising, community-driven projects directly to a wider audience, facilitating seamless on-chain trading. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter? Binance Alpha is not your typical exchange listing platform. It functions as a dedicated space within the Binance Wallet, designed to spotlight early-stage crypto projects that show significant potential. The selection process for these tokens is meticulous, focusing heavily on robust community engagement and alignment with emerging market trends. This approach allows Binance to act as a discovery engine, providing its vast user base with early access to tokens that might otherwise remain undiscovered by many. By integrating on-chain trading directly into the Binance Wallet and Exchange, Binance Alpha simplifies the user experience, making it easier to engage with these nascent assets. Consider the landscape of crypto project discovery. Traditionally, finding promising early-stage tokens often involved navigating complex decentralized exchanges, dealing with high gas fees, and sifting through numerous unvetted projects. Binance Alpha aims to streamline this process, offering a more accessible and somewhat curated environment. This distinction is crucial for both project developers seeking visibility and investors looking for opportunities. Aspect Binance Alpha Approach Traditional Exchange Listing Project Stage Early-stage, emerging More established, proven Selection Criteria Community engagement, market trends Volume, market cap, regulatory compliance Trading Method On-chain via Binance Wallet/Exchange Centralized exchange order books Risk Profile Higher (potential for high reward) Lower (more stability) Toshi (TOSHI) Joins the Ranks: What Makes it Stand Out? The addition of Toshi (TOSHI) to Binance Alpha has naturally drawn attention. Toshi is a cat-themed meme coin operating on the Base blockchain, gaining traction through its active community and humorous branding. While meme coins often carry a speculative nature, Toshi has managed to build a noticeable presence within its niche. Its inclusion on Binance Alpha suggests that the platform recognizes the power of strong community backing and the potential for rapid growth that such projects can exhibit. TOSHI‚Äôs journey highlights the evolving criteria for project visibility. Beyond just technological innovation, factors like viral potential, active social media presence, and community-driven development play a significant role. For Binance Alpha, identifying projects like Toshi is about tapping into the pulse of the crypto community and offering what‚Äôs trending and engaging. Toshi (TOSHI) joins Binance Alpha, expanding early-stage crypto access. Unlocking Potential: How Does Binance Alpha Benefit Investors? For investors, the arrival of projects like Toshi on Binance Alpha presents several compelling advantages. The primary benefit is early access. Investing in projects at their nascent stages can offer substantial returns if the project gains wider adoption and its value appreciates. Binance Alpha‚Äôs curated selection process, while not a guarantee of success, does provide a layer of initial vetting that can help users navigate the often-risky early crypto market. Key benefits for investors include: Early Discovery: Access to projects before they become widely known, potentially leading to higher returns. Streamlined Access: Direct on-chain trading integration within the familiar Binance Wallet and Exchange environment, simplifying the process of acquiring and managing these tokens. Community-Driven Focus: Projects selected often have strong, engaged communities, which can be a vital indicator of long-term viability and growth potential. Reduced Friction: Eliminates the need to navigate multiple decentralized platforms for early-stage investments. Navigating the Waters: What Are the Risks of Early-Stage Crypto on Binance Alpha? While the potential rewards are significant, it is crucial for investors to understand the inherent risks associated with early-stage crypto projects, even those featured on Binance Alpha . The very nature of ‚Äòearly-stage‚Äô implies a higher degree of volatility and uncertainty. Projects can fail, liquidity can be low, and market sentiment can shift rapidly. Meme coins, in particular, are highly speculative and their value can be driven more by social trends than fundamental utility. Here are some considerations for navigating this space: High Volatility: Prices can fluctuate wildly, leading to rapid gains or losses. Project Failure: Not all early projects succeed; some may even be abandoned or prove to be scams. Liquidity Issues: Early tokens might have limited trading volume, making it difficult to buy or sell large amounts without impacting the price. Market Hype: Decisions based purely on hype without fundamental research can lead to poor outcomes. It is paramount for any investor to conduct their own thorough research (DYOR) before committing capital. Diversifying investments and only investing what you can afford to lose are fundamental principles in this high-risk, high-reward environment. The Future Landscape: What‚Äôs Next for Binance Alpha and Early Crypto Adoption? The strategic move by Binance to expand its Binance Alpha platform and include projects like Toshi underscores a broader trend in the crypto industry: the increasing focus on user accessibility and the democratization of early-stage investment opportunities. As the crypto market matures, platforms that can efficiently bridge the gap between innovative new projects and a global investor base will play a pivotal role. Binance Alpha could evolve into a primary gateway for emerging blockchain technologies and tokens, fostering innovation by providing crucial visibility and liquidity to projects that are still in their foundational phases. This not only benefits the projects themselves but also allows the wider crypto community to participate in the growth of the next big trends, from DeFi to NFTs and beyond. The future of early crypto adoption looks set to be more integrated and user-friendly, with platforms like Binance Alpha leading the charge. Conclusion The addition of Toshi (TOSHI) to Binance Alpha marks a significant development for both the project and the broader crypto community. It highlights Binance‚Äôs commitment to fostering innovation and providing early access to promising digital assets through its Wallet ecosystem. While the allure of early-stage investments is strong, potential participants must approach these opportunities with a clear understanding of the associated risks and a commitment to thorough due diligence. As Binance Alpha continues to evolve, it stands poised to shape the landscape of early crypto discovery and on-chain trading, making the journey into new frontiers of decentralized finance more accessible for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Binance Alpha? Binance Alpha is a platform within the Binance Wallet ecosystem designed to showcase and facilitate on-chain trading for early-stage crypto projects selected based on community engagement and emerging market trends. How are projects like Toshi selected for Binance Alpha? Projects are chosen based on criteria such as strong community engagement, alignment with current market trends, and their potential for growth, as determined by Binance‚Äôs internal assessment. Is Toshi (TOSHI) available for trading on the main Binance exchange? Currently, Toshi (TOSHI) has been added to Binance Alpha, which focuses on early-stage projects and facilitates on-chain trading via the Binance Wallet. Its availability on the main Binance exchange would be subject to separate listing decisions. What are the risks of investing in early-stage projects on Binance Alpha? Early-stage projects carry higher risks, including significant price volatility, potential for project failure, and lower liquidity compared to more established assets. Investors should conduct their own research and understand these risks. How does on-chain trading work within Binance Wallet? On-chain trading within Binance Wallet allows users to directly interact with decentralized protocols and smart contracts using their wallet funds, enabling direct token swaps and other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities without needing to transfer assets to a centralized exchange‚Äôs order book.

2025-08-01 09:21:43,49354566,1754040103,"Key SOL price levels to watch out for as $180 support holds, are traders pivoting to early-stage plays like RTX?","Solana Price held firm over the critical $180 support level this week, even as minor corrections provoked volatility across top altcoins. While its price oscillated at $177.15, this resilience has spurred new interest in Solana‚Äôs performance behind the scenes. Some crypto traders are quietly concentrating, though, on early DeFi plays‚Äîparticularly those with real-world utility, such as Remittix (RTX). Solana price holds steady amid market churn Solana‚Äôs recent fall of 0.69% hasn‚Äôt been enough to break its strong $180 support level. In fact, Solana Price appears to be holding steady amidst general macroeconomic uncertainty and market drops due to Bitcoin. Its present market capitalization is standing at $95.31 billion, with daily trading volume rising by nearly 5%, to $5.63 billion. This reflects continued interest among retail traders as well as institutional investors. But others in the crypto universe are seeking elsewhere for plays‚Äîespecially crypto with real utility and payment infrastructure that can scale. That‚Äôs where a new cross-chain DeFi project is starting to gain traction. Early-stage crypto investment gains momentum While most top assets like Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin post incremental gains, investors are seeking early-stage crypto investments that hold more than speculative value. The quest for the next big crypto launch or top crypto presale 2025 that solves real problems is on. Remittix (RTX), priced at a paltry $0.0895 per token , has flown under the radar to get past the $17.9 million funding milestone, selling over 577 million tokens. The project offers global crypto-to-bank payments‚Äîa utility that makes it stand out right away. When the hype narrative subsides to realities, projects like Remittix fall under the high-upside, low cap crypto gems meant for real-world use. Remittix: solving real problems with global crypto payments Remittix is essentially a cross-chain DeFi initiative through which users can transfer cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and XRP directly into bank accounts across over 30 nations. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, it aims to replace clunky remittance systems with real-time transfers. The pi√®ce de r√©sistance? Its Q3 2025-launched beta wallet, boasting a beautiful mobile-first interface with real-time FX conversion, low gas fees, and decentralised exchange integration and support for crypto staking. It‚Äôs also one of the few soon-to-launch crypto projects with passive income potential, and its 50% token bonus is live now through the $18Million soft cap. Why Remittix is gaining steam Real Utility: Send crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries Beta Wallet: Launching Q3 with mobile-first features Deflationary Tokenomics: Long-term holder rewards $250,000 Giveaway: Enter the giveaway during presale 50% Bonus: Active now before soft cap marker You can buy the RTX token directly from the official Remittix website, with early buy offering special benefits. Why traders are watching beyond Solana price right now As big as Solana Price is a watchlist stock, more and more are diversifying into problem-solving crypto. With decentralised exchanges keeping it more in control and Layer 2 solutions ruling the day, Remittix is offering something different. As a leading DeFi altcoin prospect and leading crypto under $1, Remittix is shaking things up for its ability to bridge crypto with traditional finance‚Äîwithout sacrificing decentralisation. Momentum is not fueled by a roadmap, but by a functional product.

2025-08-01 09:21:30,49354565,1754040090,ETH price prediction: how high can it go if institutions are buying billions?,"For many crypto natives, yesterday‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee meeting didn‚Äôt go as planned. The FOMC decided to keep the rate cuts between a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, despite President Trump‚Äôs call for a cut and a growing bias towards risk-on assets. The market reacted swiftly, with Bitcoin cooling off with a 2% intraday dip while altcoins fell harder. ETF inflows ensured alts like Ethereum quickly bounced back, making Ethereum price prediction a hot topic within crypto circles. Last week alone, Ethereum benefited from $1.9B in ETF inflows, and the pace of institutional money hasn‚Äôt slowed down. Institutional money keeps moving into Ethereum, and bulls might now be eyeing higher upside for the blue-chip this cycle. Meanwhile, there is an ETH token in the name of Remittix (RTX), seeing aggressive buy activity from whales and retail investors. Let‚Äôs get into the details. EFT inflows pushing a bullish narrative for Ethereum price prediction The FOMC‚Äôs decision to maintain rates for the fifth time in a row hasn‚Äôt dampened institutional enthusiasm. Ethereum has shown strength, all thanks to institutional money and increased whale activity. Source: TradingView Last week alone, ETH attracted $1.9 billion in inflows, part of a record 19-day ETF inflow streak totaling $5.38 billion. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA stays on top, seizing roughly 80% of that volume. A few other points worth mentioning include: Ethereum now has over $22 billion locked in ETF holdings, representing 4.7% of the circulating supply. Corporate treasuries hold over $10B in ETH, a new high that even surpasses the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs reserves. Ethereum‚Äôs open interest dominance has climbed to 40%, the highest in two years, signaling strong conviction among leveraged traders. Source: X As of today, more ETH is now sitting in institutional vaults and long-term treasuries, and the market, in turn, is preparing for a supply shock, a scenario where reduced circulating supply could drastically push prices up. Analysts eye $4,000+ Ethereum price prediction in the near term, especially if ETF inflows continue at this pace. Whales bet on Remittix to hit the ground running Remittix (RTX) is another project seeing aggressive buy activity from whales and retail investors. Remittix‚Äôs big value proposition lies in its real-world utility. As a cross-border payments protocol, it aims to simplify how people send and receive money globally. Remittix bridges crypto and fiat payments through a PayFi framework that integrates instant transactions and standardised rails for direct fiat conversion in 30+ countries. Investors, including whales, have started pivoting toward RTX for several reasons, namely: Remittix targets the global remittance and payment market valued at $190T. The big market players see this entry as a bold yet timely move, and they are willing to place their bets on it. Over $17.9M has already been raised, and the project is now inches away from its $18M soft cap, a milestone that could trigger heightened visibility and post-launch demand. RTX‚Äôs deflationary mechanics, staking rewards, and emissions routed to liquidity pools mean it has an architecture that incentivises long-term holding.

2025-08-01 09:20:49,49353306,1754040049,Are Traders Done With Ether? Options Market Now Prices Higher Risk for ETH Than BTC,"It's become more expensive to use derivatives to insure against a decline in ether (ETH) than in bitcoin (BTC), indicating that market sentiment has shifted against the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, data from Deribit shows. The sentiment shift comes after weeks of big money favoring ether over its larger peer. According to data from Amberdata, ether's 25-delta risk reversals for options expiring in August and September were trading at -2% to -7%. That means put options, which provide protection against drops in price, carry a 2% to 7% premium over call options, reflecting an apparent concern about a potential downside risk. In comparison, bitcoin's short-term put options traded at 1%-2.5% premium to calls, suggesting relatively restrained downside fears. A put option gives the purchaser the right to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified future date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, seeking to hedge spot market holdings or profit from a price decline. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. The 25-delta risk reversal is an options strategy that comprises a long put position and a short call option¬†(or vice versa)¬†with a 25% delta, meaning the strike price for both options is relatively far from the underlying asset's market rate. Risk reversals are widely tracked in the FX markets to gauge sentiment across time frames. Positive values represent bullish sentiment, while negative values suggest the reverse. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain surged 48% in July, reaching a seven-month high of $3,941 and outperforming BTC's 8% gain by a wide margin. Most of the advance, however, occurred in the first half of the month, with the rally losing steam on concerns it stemmed purely from corporate adoption and lacked support from on-chain activity. Ether was recently trading at $3,600, down more than 6% over 24 hours, while bitcoin had lost 3% to $114,380, according to CoinDesk data .",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Markets|Deribit|Options|News,EN,0,become expensive use derivative insure decline ether eth bitcoin btc indicating market sentiment shifted cryptocurrency market cap data deribit show sentiment shift come week big money favoring ether larger peer according data amberdata ether risk reversal option expiring august september trading mean put option provide protection drop price carry premium call option reflecting apparent concern potential downside risk comparison bitcoin put option traded premium call suggesting relatively restrained downside fear put option give purchaser right sell underlying asset predetermined price specified future date put buyer implicitly bearish market seeking hedge spot market holding profit price decline call buyer implicitly bullish market risk reversal option strategy comprises long put position short call option vice versa delta meaning strike price option relatively far underlying asset market rate risk reversal widely tracked fx market gauge sentiment across time frame positive value represent bullish sentiment negative value suggest reverse ether native token ethereum blockchain surged july reaching high outperforming btc gain wide margin advance however occurred first half month rally losing steam concern stemmed purely corporate adoption lacked support activity ether recently trading hour bitcoin lost according coindesk data,0.139,0.692,0.169,0.872,1
2025-08-01 09:18:55,49362763,1754039935,Cardano Founder Predicts the Global Crypto Market to Hit $10 Trillion After CLARITY Act Passes,"Cardano founder says the next phase of crypto growth depends on Washington's regulatory clarity and the entry of tech giants into the industry. In a recent interview , Charles Hoskinson said the CLARITY Act could open the door to a massive market expansion, led by stablecoins, real-world assets, and major tech firms.Regulatory Clarity Could Drive Market ExpansionHoskinson pointed to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, commonly known as the CLARITY Act, as a potential turning point for the industry. The bill, which passed in the House of Representatives on July 17, aims to establish a clear regulatory structure for digital assets, including classification, trading, and oversight responsibilities. Cardano cofounder predicts stablecoin surge Cardano co-founder predicts stablecoin surge The proposed law would define which agency, either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), regulates different types of assets. It would also introduce compliance standards for trading platforms and offer legal certainty for developers and investors.Hoskinson Expects Entry of Big Tech and RWAsHoskinson said the passing of the bill could prompt entry from the so-called MAG7 companies, which include Microsoft, Apple, Google‚Äôs parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla. These firms, he believes, may begin exploring or investing in blockchain and crypto assets once legal boundaries are clearly defined.He also emphasized the growing role of real-world assets (RWAs), which are blockchain representations of tangible or financial assets like real estate or bonds.¬†Predicting the growth in the industry, Hoskinson noted that when the CLARITY Act passes, the stablecoin market will surge above $1‚Äì2 trillion. Hoskinson is also very bullish on the global crypto market cap, expecting an uptick above $10 trillion.¬†For context, the global crypto market cap stands at $3.803 trillion, after a massive 8.1% decline in the past day. Bitcoin dominance stands at 61.2% with a market cap of $2.80 trillion. A surge of the global crypto market cap to $10 trillion will push Bitcoin's market cap to $6.12 trillion at this dominance rate, translating to a price of over $300,000 per BTC.Stablecoin Growth Continues to AccelerateMeanwhile, recent data supports Hoskinson‚Äôs outlook for stablecoins. The Kobeissi Letter reported that stablecoins now hold $149 billion in U.S. Treasuries, up 64% since Q1 2023. The total stablecoin market cap has doubled over the same period, reaching an estimated $240 billion.This growth has positioned stablecoins as one of the largest external holders of U.S. debt. Analysts at Apollo noted that rising demand for dollar-based stablecoins could translate into greater demand for short-term Treasury bills.The GENIUS Act, another federal initiative, has further supported the stablecoin market by allowing greater interoperability between digital currencies and the traditional financial system.In furtherance of this act, Trump‚Äôs crypto adviser, Bo Hines, projected that the digital asset market could grow to between $15 trillion and $20 trillion in the coming years, up from its current $3.81 trillion valuation.¬†Hines noted that the passage of the GENIUS Act could drive massive capital inflows. He believes the act lays the groundwork for innovations like tokenized public securities and 24/7 financial markets, with dollar-backed stablecoins becoming central to U.S. capital market access.",Market|Charles Hoskinson News,EN,1,cardano founder say next phase crypto growth depends washington regulatory clarity entry tech giant industry recent interview charles hoskinson said clarity act could open door massive market expansion led stablecoins asset major tech clarity could drive market expansionhoskinson pointed digital asset market clarity act commonly known clarity act potential turning point industry bill passed house representative july aim establish clear regulatory structure digital asset including classification trading oversight responsibility cardano cofounder predicts stablecoin surge cardano predicts stablecoin surge proposed law would define agency either security exchange commission sec commodity future trading commission cftc regulates different type asset would also introduce compliance standard trading platform offer legal certainty developer expects entry big tech rwashoskinson said passing bill could prompt entry company include microsoft apple google parent alphabet amazon meta nvidia tesla firm belief may begin exploring investing blockchain crypto asset legal boundary clearly also emphasized growing role asset rwas blockchain representation tangible financial asset like real estate bond predicting growth industry hoskinson noted clarity act pass stablecoin market surge trillion hoskinson also bullish global crypto market cap expecting uptick trillion context global crypto market cap stand trillion massive decline past day bitcoin dominance stand market cap trillion surge global crypto market cap trillion push bitcoin market cap trillion dominance rate translating price per growth continues acceleratemeanwhile recent data support hoskinson outlook stablecoins kobeissi letter reported stablecoins hold billion treasury since total stablecoin market cap doubled period reaching estimated growth positioned stablecoins one largest external holder debt analyst apollo noted rising demand stablecoins could translate greater demand treasury genius act another federal initiative supported stablecoin market allowing greater interoperability digital currency traditional financial furtherance act trump crypto adviser bo hines projected digital asset market could grow trillion trillion coming year current trillion valuation hines noted passage genius act could drive massive capital inflow belief act lay groundwork innovation like tokenized public security financial market stablecoins becoming central capital market access,0.015,0.731,0.255,0.9974,1

He shared his hopes for the network‚Äôs future as Ethereum celebrated its 10th anniversary since its launch on July 30, 2015. During the anniversary livestream, Buterin recalled that the original plan was to create an open space for global developers. He said he wanted to develop a space where anyone could freely build applications and express their creativity. Buterin believes Ethereum will continue to grow The Canadian computer programmer maintained that Ethereum‚Äôs core mission is to continue advancing human progress and safeguarding people‚Äôs digital autonomy. He believes that feat requires the network to remain online and never go down. Buterin added that the network has to be programmable if it wants to be open to people building their own things on top of it. He reiterated that the core of Ethereum is enabling applications that continue to move humanity forward and improve our ability to cooperate. Ethereum supporter and Oxbow co-founder, Zak Cole, said that the network‚Äôs most incredible feature is that it refuses to go down. He highlighted that ETH has managed to go against all odds, through forks, failures, regulatory attacks, and civil wars. Cole added that the network was caught off guard by the DAO hack, DeFi summer, and the NFTs explosion, but they still managed to build through it. Ethereum co-creator Joseph Lubin also said that Consensys has been instrumental in shaping the network‚Äôs infrastructure. The company revealed in its latest report that it has outlined an ambitious roadmap for Ethereum‚Äôs future. Chief economist at Rice University, Mallesh Pai, believes that the network will transition from a smart contract platform to the base layer of the future global economy over the next 5-10 years. He mentioned in the report that the growth will be driven by the digitization of assets such as stablecoins . He added that assets migrating on-chain depend on both current contributors and a new generation of institutional and commercial builders. GameSquare‚Äôs CEO, Justin Kenna, said the company invested in ETH because they believed it‚Äôs the most credible long-term virtual currency aligned with where the internet is headed. He added that the network is evolving into the financial backbone of the internet, powering global payments, entertainment IP, gaming economies, and digital identity. ‚ÄúOver the next 10 years, every large enterprise will move on-chain, and most will vertically integrate into their own infrastructure on top of Ethereum.‚Äù ‚Äì Sam McIngvale, Head of Product at Optimism Labs. Nemil Dalal, head of Coinbase, argued that Ethereum‚Äôs builder community will determine its long-term success in the next 10 years. He also sees the network transforming into the foundation for new use cases as the builders keep experimenting. Corporate treasury firms signal Ethereum‚Äôs growing institutional adoption The world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency and blockchain network has seen an influx of corporations recognizing it as the next emerging treasury asset. BitMine Immersion Technologies holds roughly 625,000 and ranks as the largest ETH treasury firm. The company also recently revealed plans to acquire up to 5% of Ether‚Äôs supply. Sharplink also holds around 438,190 ETH as its treasury reserve asset. The company added around $290 million in ETH last week at an average price of $3,756. Bit Digital follows with a total of 100,603 ETH in its holdings. The firm also announced on July 7 plans to transition to an Ethereum treasury strategy. The plan includes a $172 million public equity raise and a conversion of its assets from Bitcoin to Ether. BTCS holds roughly 70,028 ETH in its holdings, with plans to close a $10 million convertible note issuance program.

According to the blockchain tracker Whale Alert, the two addresses that were previously active in April of 2010 have now transferred a total of slightly over $11.8 million in Bitcoin. The relatively older address among the two initially received 50 Bitcoin on April 18th of 2010, when BTC was trading at $0.00547.

2025-08-01 09:15:10,49352582,1754039710,USDCAD Forecast: UBS Predicts Crucial Decline Towards 1.34-1.35 by Mid-2025,"BitcoinWorld USDCAD Forecast: UBS Predicts Crucial Decline Towards 1.34-1.35 by Mid-2025 In the dynamic world of finance, where digital assets like cryptocurrencies often capture headlines with their rapid movements, it is easy to overlook the foundational shifts happening in traditional markets. Yet, understanding macroeconomic trends, especially in the foreign exchange (Forex) market, is crucial for anyone navigating the broader financial landscape. Just as Bitcoin reacts to global liquidity, major currency pairs like USDCAD are influenced by central bank policies, economic data, and geopolitical events. Recently, a significant USDCAD forecast from UBS has caught the attention of market watchers, predicting a notable decline in the pair by the second half of 2025. This projection suggests a strengthening Canadian Dollar relative to the US Dollar, a development with far-reaching implications for traders and investors alike. What is UBS Predicting for USDCAD‚Äôs Future? UBS, a leading global financial services company, has issued a compelling outlook for the USDCAD currency pair. Their analysis suggests that by the latter half of 2025, the pair is expected to trend downwards, potentially reaching the 1.34-1.35 range. For those unfamiliar, a decline in USDCAD signifies that it will take fewer Canadian Dollars to purchase one US Dollar, effectively meaning the Canadian Dollar is strengthening against the US Dollar. This forecast is not merely a random guess but is rooted in a comprehensive assessment of various economic indicators and central bank policies from both Canada and the United States. This prediction offers a valuable directional bias for traders and investors, highlighting a potential long-term trend rather than short-term volatility. Understanding the rationale behind such a significant forecast can provide a strategic edge, whether you are directly involved in Forex trading or simply monitoring global economic shifts that indirectly impact other asset classes, including the crypto market. Why the Anticipated Decline? Analyzing the Canadian Dollar Outlook The core of UBS‚Äôs USDCAD forecast lies in the anticipated strength of the Canadian Dollar. Several factors contribute to this optimistic Canadian Dollar outlook . Canada‚Äôs economy, heavily reliant on commodity exports, particularly oil, stands to benefit from a potentially stable or rising commodity price environment. Here are some key drivers supporting a stronger CAD: Bank of Canada (BoC) Policy: The Bank of Canada has shown a willingness to adjust its monetary policy based on domestic economic conditions. If inflation remains sticky or economic growth proves more resilient than expected, the BoC might maintain higher interest rates for longer, or even embark on further rate hikes. Higher interest rates typically attract foreign capital, increasing demand for the Canadian Dollar. Commodity Prices: As a major oil producer, Canada‚Äôs currency is often correlated with crude oil prices. A sustained period of higher oil prices would boost Canada‚Äôs export revenues, improve its terms of trade, and generally support the CAD. Global demand trends and geopolitical stability play a crucial role here. Economic Fundamentals: A robust Canadian labor market, stable housing sector, and steady GDP growth would provide a strong foundation for the CAD. If Canada‚Äôs economic performance outpaces that of the US, it naturally creates upward pressure on the Canadian Dollar. These elements, combined, paint a picture of a Canadian economy that could see its currency appreciate over the coming year, driving the USDCAD pair lower. Understanding the US Dollar‚Äôs Role in Forex Market Analysis While the strength of the Canadian Dollar is one side of the coin, the other is the potential weakening of the US Dollar. The US Dollar‚Äôs trajectory is equally critical in any comprehensive Forex market analysis for the USDCAD pair. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) monetary policy, US economic performance, and global risk sentiment are pivotal factors. Here‚Äôs what could contribute to a softer USD: Federal Reserve Policy: The market widely anticipates the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates as inflation moderates and the economy potentially slows down. Lower interest rates in the US would reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, leading to capital outflows and a weaker dollar. The pace and depth of these cuts will be key. US Economic Growth: While the US economy has shown remarkable resilience, signs of slowing growth, increased unemployment, or a potential recession could diminish confidence in the US Dollar. A divergence in growth trajectories, where Canada‚Äôs economy performs relatively better, would favor the CAD. Global Risk Appetite: The US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty. If global economic conditions stabilize or improve, investors may shift away from safe-haven assets towards riskier investments, thereby reducing demand for the US Dollar. UBS‚Äôs forecast likely factors in a scenario where the US Dollar‚Äôs strength, which has been prominent for some time, begins to wane as global economic conditions normalize and central banks adjust their policies in response to evolving inflation and growth dynamics. How Does This Impact Your Currency Trading Strategies? For traders and investors, a clear USDCAD forecast from a reputable institution like UBS provides actionable insights that can be integrated into various currency trading strategies . Understanding this long-term outlook can help in formulating positions and managing risk effectively. Potential Opportunities: Shorting USDCAD: The most direct implication is the opportunity to short the USDCAD pair, betting on its decline. This involves selling USDCAD with the expectation of buying it back at a lower price. Longing CAD-denominated Assets: Beyond direct currency trading, a stronger Canadian Dollar could make Canadian bonds, equities, and other assets more attractive to foreign investors, potentially increasing their returns when converted back to their home currency. Hedging Strategies: Businesses with exposure to CAD or USD can use this forecast to refine their hedging strategies, protecting against adverse currency movements. Key Considerations for Traders: Entry and Exit Points: While the long-term direction is indicated, precise entry and exit points remain crucial. Traders should use technical analysis alongside fundamental insights to time their trades. Risk Management: Even with a strong forecast, market conditions can change rapidly. Employing stop-loss orders and managing position sizes are vital to mitigate potential losses if the forecast does not materialize as expected. Monitoring Data: Continuously monitor economic data releases from both Canada and the US, as well as statements from the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve. Any significant deviation from expected data could alter the forecast. This long-term perspective allows for more strategic planning, moving beyond the noise of daily fluctuations to capitalize on a potentially significant trend. Beyond the Numbers: Broader UBS Economic Predictions The USDCAD forecast is part of a broader set of UBS economic predictions that paint a picture of the global financial landscape. These predictions are not made in isolation but are interconnected with global growth prospects, inflation trends, and the overall trajectory of central bank policies worldwide. UBS likely anticipates a period where global inflation gradually recedes, allowing central banks, including the Fed, to ease their restrictive monetary policies. This shift from tightening to easing cycles often leads to a recalibration of currency valuations. Furthermore, UBS‚Äôs outlook may consider the potential for a soft landing for major economies, avoiding a severe recession while inflation returns to target levels. In such an environment, growth differentials between countries become more prominent, influencing capital flows and currency strength. The nuanced interplay of these macro factors forms the bedrock of their currency projections, providing a holistic view of the forces shaping the future of major currency pairs. Challenges and Risks to the Forecast While UBS‚Äôs forecast provides a strong directional bias, it is important to acknowledge that financial markets are inherently unpredictable, and various factors could alter this outlook. Potential challenges and risks include: Unexpected Economic Data: A sudden surge in US inflation or an unexpected downturn in the Canadian economy could lead to policy reversals by central banks, impacting the USDCAD pair differently than projected. Geopolitical Events: Major geopolitical conflicts or crises can trigger safe-haven flows into the US Dollar, regardless of economic fundamentals, temporarily or even permanently altering its trajectory. Commodity Price Volatility: A significant and sustained drop in oil prices, perhaps due to oversupply or a global recession, would negatively impact the Canadian Dollar, challenging the forecast. Policy Divergence: If the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve adopt significantly different monetary policy paths than currently anticipated, it could lead to unexpected currency movements. Therefore, while the UBS forecast offers a valuable guide, continuous monitoring of market developments and a flexible approach to trading strategies are essential. A Compelling Summary UBS‚Äôs projection for USDCAD to decline towards 1.34-1.35 by the second half of 2025 signals a significant shift in the currency landscape. This forecast is underpinned by expectations of a strengthening Canadian Dollar, driven by factors such as the Bank of Canada‚Äôs policy stance and commodity price trends, alongside a potentially weakening US Dollar influenced by anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and evolving US economic conditions. For those engaged in currency trading strategies , this outlook presents potential opportunities for short positions on USDCAD or investing in CAD-denominated assets. However, it is crucial to approach this with a robust understanding of risk management and to remain vigilant to economic data and geopolitical developments that could influence the Forex market analysis . Ultimately, staying informed about expert UBS economic predictions and broader macroeconomic trends is key to navigating the complexities of the global financial markets, ensuring you are prepared for what lies ahead.

Whales sold $28M daily, after 310M XRP were accumulated ahead of the recent rally. Exchange balances had also declined recently. Analysts see $3.23 as key resistance and $2.80 as a crucial short-term bullish zone. XRP Faces Sharp 24-Hour Decline Ripple (XRP) dropped 8% in the last 24 hours, sliding from a session high of $3.17 to a low of $2.9. The steepest move came during the midnight trading window on August 1, when the token fell 3% in one hour on 259.21 million units traded, nearly four times its usual hourly volume. At press time, XRP trades at $2.91 with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.4 million. Over the past seven days, the token is down 5%. Its market capitalization stands at $174 billion, based on a circulating supply of 59 billion XRP. Analyst Notes Bullish Monthly Candle Crypto analyst CRYPTOWZRD said the daily candle closed bearish, while the monthly candle finished strongly bullish. He explained that XRP holding above $2.80 remains a bullish area, and a push beyond $3.30 could lead to a rally toward $3.65. XRP Daily Technical Outlook: $XRP closed bearish. However, the Monthly candle printed strongly bullish. I‚Äôll look for more short-term volatility from here to scalp opportunities.

Trading above it could support long positions, while a drop below $3 keeps conditions bearish. The analyst expects short-term volatility, with Bitcoin and its dominance likely to guide market direction. Market Structure and Whale Activity A double bottom pattern may be forming as XRP bounced twice from the same support level. A confirmed break above the pattern‚Äôs resistance would open the way for a new attempt at recovery. On-chain data shows mixed whale behavior. Large holders have sold roughly $28 million worth of XRP per day over the last 90 days. At the same time, over 310 million XRP tokens, valued at nearly $1 billion, were accumulated during the recent correction as exchange balances fell, showing movement toward off-exchange storage.

2025-08-01 09:11:47,49352422,1754039507,New Meme Coin ‚ÄòMaxi Doge‚Äô Raises $150k In Presale On Launch Day - Next 100x Crypto?,"While large caps like Bitcoin and Ethereum are taking a breather, low-cap meme coins continue to offer explosive gains. Smart money investors continue to hunt for small-cap meme tokens for life-changing gains. For instance, a new DOGE-themed meme coin, Maxi Doge (MAXI) , is already going viral on the first day of its presale, having already raised nearly $150k within 24 hours of launching its website. MAXI isn‚Äôt one of those meme coins that are trying to deceptively trying to sell themselves on utility. Instead, the project is all about meme culture, degenerate lifestyle and 1000x trading. Indeed, Maxi Doge is portrayed as the gym-bro, caffeine-chugging alpha cousin of Dogecoin, blending comic-level absurdity with raw pump power. The new meme coin has already caught the attention of several prominent influencers and analysts, with some even calling it the next 100x crypto. Maxi Doge - New Dog Meme Coin On The Block As described in both the official site and its whitepaper , Maxi‚ÄØDoge is ‚Äúthe locked-in meme coin degen trading on 1000√ó leverage‚Äù, a fully satirical portrayal of traders who want fast charts, big pumps, and no distractions. You‚Äôre not buying utility; you‚Äôre buying the vibe. It‚Äôs a Dogecoin parody transformed into a shredded, pre-workout-fueled beast flexing on weak hands. The whitepaper leans into crazy bro-energy: describing Maxi‚ÄØDoge as a 240‚Äëlb canine juggernaut made to ‚Äúlift, trade, and repeat.‚Äù In the very first image on the project website, the shredded Maxi Doge is chugging Red Bull while printing green candles. His bloodshot eyes are a sign that the ‚Äúno sleep season‚Äù is likely ongoing. On his desk, a monitor flashes the question that haunts every trader: ‚ÄúHow to retire at 22?‚Äù Like any true crypto degen, Maxi‚ÄØDoge lives on social media. His Discord alter ego, Pump Daddy, recently claimed he sold his house to go all-in on leverage, a move that perfectly sums up the project‚Äôs spirit. Surprisingly, our gym-bro dog does find time to read books. His collection includes masterpieces like ‚ÄúThe Degen‚Äôs Manifesto‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Only Buy Green‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNo Risk, No Ramen‚Äù. In his dreams, Maxi Doge wields green candles like a lightsaber, fighting the ultimate villain, ‚ÄúDarth Fader‚Äù. Maxi Doge is a comedic portrayal of the crypto degen lifestyle. Surprisingly, projects like these tend to do significantly better than meme coins trying to peddle utility and AI. Inventors have woken up to the latter and understand that fundamentals do not matter in the meme coin sector. Some of the biggest meme coins, Dogecoin, Pepe and Fartcoin, are just tokens based on a popular meme. Maxi Doge is nothing different. However, this new meme coin does promise to help its followers find their next 1000x trades. It promises exclusive access to ‚Äúcommunity alpha,‚Äù leveraged trading strategies and weekly competitions. MAXI Token Presale USPs: Community-Centric Tokenomics, High APY Staking, Smart Contract Audits While Maxi Doge leans heavily into its meme-fueled identity, it does have sound fundamentals. The project‚Äôs tokenomics are deliberately designed to favour long-term community growth over early exits. A substantial portion of the supply is earmarked for marketing, staking rewards, and liquidity, with no separate allocation made for any private sale. Staking is another key feature drawing investor attention. Maxi Doge offers high-yield staking, with the current APY in the four-digit range. However, the yield percentage is set to decline as an increasingly higher number of coins are staked into the pool, which rewards early buyers. Crucially, Maxi Doge‚Äôs smart contract has undergone a full audit by Coinsult and Solid Proof , adding a layer of credibility in a market rife with rug pulls and scam presales. For instance, the Coinsult audit did not find any vulnerability or security risk associated with the MAXI smart contract. Moreover, the owner of the smart contract cannot blacklist addresses, set high fees or mint new tokens. There is also no honeypot feature. The team has made the audit publicly available, which may reassure retail investors wary of meme coin volatility. Combined, these elements give Maxi Doge sound fundamentals that tend to attract whales and smart money investors. Is Maxi Doge The Next 100x Crypto? Do not underestimate the degen culture. The Maxi Doge meme coin is designed to give meme coin traders, low-cap hunters, and crypto influencers a laugh, which is the mark of a successful project. Moreover, it could emerge as an excellent beta bet on Dogecoin, considering both are DOGE-themed memes. With DOGE expected to hit $1 this bull cycle, its lower-cap alternatives like MAXI could offer outsized returns as well. Some prominent crypto analysts are already bullish on Maxi Doge‚Äôs upside potential, even calling it the next 100x crypto. Interested buyers can visit the maxidogetoken.com project website and use the OTC widget to invest in MAXI. Alternatively, they can buy the meme coin seamlessly via the Best Wallet app. Investors can also get the latest updates about the project via its X and Telegram accounts.

2025-08-01 09:10:10,49352417,1754039410,Corporate Crypto Investment: Nasdaq-Listed Cemtrex Unleashes Bold $10M Plan,"BitcoinWorld Corporate Crypto Investment: Nasdaq-Listed Cemtrex Unleashes Bold $10M Plan In a surprising and significant move, Nasdaq-listed electronics manufacturer Cemtrex (CETX) has boldly announced a $10 million strategic corporate crypto investment plan. This announcement sends ripples through both the traditional finance and digital asset sectors, signaling a growing trend of established companies embracing the cryptocurrency space, often seen as volatile and cutting-edge. What Exactly is Cemtrex‚Äôs Bold Move in Corporate Crypto Investment ? Cemtrex, a company with a long-standing presence in industrial and electronics solutions, has made a decisive step into the digital asset arena with a substantial commitment. This initial foray into cryptocurrencies involved a notable purchase of Solana (SOL), a high-performance blockchain platform known for its speed and efficiency. The company‚Äôs press release via Globe Newswire detailed this initial acquisition as part of a larger, carefully considered investment strategy. Initial Purchase: Cemtrex acquired 5,500 SOL tokens, demonstrating a tangible entry into the crypto market. Value at Purchase: This initial acquisition was valued at $1 million, representing a significant portion of their announced $10 million plan. Average Price: The average purchase price per SOL token was $181, indicating the market conditions at the time of their entry. Future Focus: Solana is explicitly earmarked to remain the largest component of Cemtrex‚Äôs future crypto holdings. This long-term perspective suggests a belief in Solana‚Äôs underlying technology and ecosystem growth rather than short-term speculation. This decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity highlights a growing confidence among publicly traded companies in the viability and potential long-term returns of digital assets. It also showcases a willingness to explore beyond just Bitcoin, embracing promising altcoins with strong technological fundamentals like Solana. Why Solana? Understanding the Strategic Choice for Corporate Crypto Investment Cemtrex‚Äôs choice to make Solana a cornerstone of its crypto portfolio is a strategic one, reflecting a careful assessment of the blockchain landscape. Solana has rapidly emerged as a leading contender in the decentralized space, primarily due to its innovative architecture and impressive performance metrics that cater to the demands of institutional investors and large-scale applications. Feature Benefit for Corporate Investment High Throughput (TPS) Capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second, enabling efficient and scalable operations for large entities. Low Transaction Fees Minimal costs per transaction make it economically viable for frequent or large-volume operations and long-term asset management. Robust Developer Ecosystem A rapidly expanding network of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT), and Web3 applications provides diverse avenues for future engagement and value growth. Scalability and Innovation Designed from the ground up to handle enterprise-level demands without compromising on speed or decentralization, indicating strong future potential. For a company like Cemtrex seeking not just a store of value but an asset with significant growth potential tied to technological advancement, Solana offers a compelling blend of performance and future-proof design, positioning it as a strong candidate for a substantial corporate crypto investment . Is This the Start of a New Wave of Corporate Crypto Investment ? Cemtrex‚Äôs announcement, while notable, is certainly not an isolated event in the corporate world. Over the past few years, a growing number of publicly traded companies have begun to integrate cryptocurrencies onto their balance sheets. While MicroStrategy remains arguably the most prominent pioneer in this space with its extensive Bitcoin holdings, other companies across various sectors have also explored this new frontier for their treasury management strategies. This evolving trend signifies a broader maturation of the crypto market and a significant shift in perception. Digital assets are increasingly being viewed less as speculative, niche investments and more as legitimate asset classes with strategic implications. Companies are now actively considering cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against inflationary pressures, a valuable tool for portfolio diversification, and even a strategic alignment with future technological and economic paradigms. The underlying motivations for this increasing corporate interest are complex and varied: Inflation Hedge: In an environment of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, cryptocurrencies with fixed or predictable supplies, like Bitcoin, are seen by some as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies. Portfolio Diversification: Crypto assets often exhibit low or negative correlation with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds, which can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Innovation & Future Growth: Investing in blockchain technology and digital assets allows companies to position themselves at the forefront of emerging technologies, fostering innovation and potentially opening new revenue streams. Attracting Talent & Investors: Embracing digital assets can project an image of a forward-thinking and innovative company, appealing to a new generation of tech-savvy employees and investors. Cemtrex‚Äôs $10 million commitment underscores this evolving corporate mindset, where digital assets are no longer just a fringe interest but a serious consideration for long-term financial health and strategic positioning. What are the Benefits and Challenges of Corporate Crypto Investment ? While the potential rewards of digital asset exposure are significant, companies embarking on such ventures must carefully navigate a landscape filled with both opportunities and inherent risks. A thorough understanding of these factors is paramount for any firm contemplating a similar path to Cemtrex‚Äôs. Benefits: Potential for High Returns: Cryptocurrencies, despite their volatility, have historically demonstrated periods of extraordinary growth, offering a compelling upside for early or strategic investors. Portfolio Diversification: The often uncorrelated nature of crypto assets with traditional financial markets can provide robust diversification benefits, potentially enhancing risk-adjusted returns for a corporate treasury. Technological Alignment: Direct investment in digital assets positions a company to better understand and integrate with cutting-edge technologies like Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi), and NFTs, fostering future business opportunities. Enhanced Brand Image: A forward-thinking stance on digital assets can signal innovation and adaptability, potentially enhancing a company‚Äôs brand appeal to a new demographic of customers, partners, and talent. Challenges: Significant Price Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their rapid and unpredictable price swings, which can lead to substantial unrealized losses on a company‚Äôs balance sheet and create financial reporting complexities. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for digital assets is still fragmented and in constant flux, posing compliance challenges, legal uncertainties, and potential policy shifts that could impact valuations. Heightened Security Risks: Storing large amounts of digital assets necessitates sophisticated cybersecurity protocols and cold storage solutions to mitigate the risk of hacks, theft, or loss due to operational errors. Complex Accounting and Tax Implications: Integrating crypto into corporate balance sheets introduces novel accounting standards and tax considerations that require specialized expertise, potentially increasing operational overhead. Cemtrex, by committing a substantial $10 million, is clearly demonstrating that it has meticulously weighed these factors and determined that the strategic benefits and potential rewards align with its long-term corporate vision, despite the inherent risks. How Does Cemtrex‚Äôs Move Impact the Broader Market and Future of Corporate Crypto Investment ? Each major corporate announcement concerning cryptocurrency investments adds another layer of institutional validation and legitimacy to the digital asset class. When a Nasdaq-listed company with Cemtrex‚Äôs profile makes such a significant and public commitment, it often serves as a powerful signal, inspiring confidence and encouraging other traditional firms to conduct their own due diligence and potentially follow suit. This increasing institutional adoption can have several profound effects on the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased Institutional Interest: The entry of more established companies like Cemtrex encourages a domino effect, prompting other corporate treasuries and institutional investors to seriously consider crypto as part of their investment portfolios. Boost in Market Liquidity and Stability: Large corporate holdings can contribute to the overall liquidity of the crypto market, potentially leading to greater price stability over time as more capital flows into the space. Pressure for Regulatory Clarity: As more traditional entities engage with cryptocurrencies, there is an increased demand and pressure on governments and regulatory bodies to provide clearer, more consistent frameworks, which could foster further mainstream adoption. Validation of Specific Projects: Cemtrex‚Äôs explicit focus on Solana provides a strong endorsement for that particular blockchain, potentially attracting more developers, users, and further investment into its rapidly expanding ecosystem. The strategic investment by Cemtrex therefore not only speaks volumes about its own foresight but also underscores a growing belief in the long-term value proposition of digital assets and their integral role in the evolving global economy. It‚Äôs a testament to the fact that cryptocurrencies are no longer just a niche for tech enthusiasts but a serious consideration for corporate treasuries worldwide. Cemtrex‚Äôs $10 million corporate crypto investment plan, spearheaded by its significant Solana acquisition, marks a pivotal moment for both the company and the broader digital asset landscape. It exemplifies a growing confidence among traditional businesses to explore and integrate cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies. While the path ahead for corporate crypto adoption involves navigating volatility and regulatory complexities, Cemtrex‚Äôs bold move highlights a clear vision for diversification and future growth. This development serves as a compelling indicator of how established industries are increasingly looking towards the decentralized future, signaling a potentially transformative era for corporate finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Cemtrex‚Äôs initial investment in cryptocurrencies? A1: Cemtrex initially invested $1 million to purchase 5,500 SOL tokens, making Solana the largest component of its current crypto holdings. Q2: Why did Cemtrex choose Solana for its corporate crypto investment?

2025-08-01 09:08:34,49362762,1754039314,Binance‚Äôs CZ to  JPMorgan CEO: You Will Use Crypto Sooner or Later,"Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao reacted to the changing tone of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, as he shared that the bank would offer Bitcoin and crypto services. Dimon shared on live television on Thursday that he is a fan of blockchain technology and stablecoins. While he still expressed slight skepticism towards Bitcoin, his comments suggest a gradual shift in sentiment towards the crypto sector.Meanwhile, this caught the attention of Zhao, popularly known as CZ, who responded with ‚Äúyou will use crypto sooner or later."" Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether he directed his comment at Dimon or if it is one of his pro-crypto statements predicting widespread Bitcoin adoption.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1950966485125570948¬†JPMorgan to Offer Bitcoin and Crypto Services: CEODimon told CNBC that JPMorgan would venture into stablecoins, a plan the firm had earlier disclosed. This builds on his earlier statement that JPMorgan will offer Bitcoin and crypto services to its customers.Notably, JPMorgan has increasingly exposed itself to the digital asset industry lately, a strategy to tap into the promising sector. For context, the $4 trillion financial institution announced a partnership with Coinbase on July 30 to allow clients to link their bank accounts directly with the Coinbase wallet.This would also enable JPMorgan customers to fund their Coinbase wallets directly from the bank and use their Chase credit cards on the trading platform. Per the announcement, the former will start in 2026, while the latter will debut in the fall of this year.Remarkably, Dimon had also disclosed in May that its customers will soon be able to buy Bitcoin. However, he noted that JPMorgan will not provide custody services for the digital assets.Stablecoins Have Some Upside Over Traditional CashThe JPMorgan CEO reiterated his support for stablecoins yesterday, stating that he believes in the digital currency and blockchain technology as a whole. He compared stablecoins to mutual funds, noting that both could share similar rules.Furthermore, Dimon highlighted that stablecoins may have some advantages over fiat, as they offer certain utilities that their traditional counterpart doesn‚Äôt. He noted that it is ‚Äúprogrammable‚Äù and allows for automated transactions.Nonetheless, he reaffirmed that he is not a personal believer in Bitcoin but noted that JPMorgan will ‚Äúaccommodate those things.‚Äù The CEO emphasized that the company‚Äôs focus is on servicing its customers over its personal preferences.Notably, Dimon has been a long-standing Bitcoin skeptic. He once called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" and a ""decentralized Ponzi scheme"" and even asked for the shutdown of the crypto industry in 2023.A core fuel for this antagonism is his belief that Bitcoin supports illegal activities like money laundering and sex trafficking. However, Bitcoin has thrived regardless, with its widespread adoption forcing Dimon's hand to allow customers exposure.Moreover, Dimon‚Äôs stablecoin acceptance echoes that seen in the United States. Congress passed the GENIUS Act on July 17, with Donald Trump signing the legislation a day later.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Changpeng Zhao (CZ) News Today|Latest Stablecoin News Today,EN,1,binance changpeng zhao reacted changing tone jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon shared bank would offer bitcoin crypto service dimon shared live television thursday fan blockchain technology stablecoins still expressed slight skepticism towards bitcoin comment suggest gradual shift sentiment towards crypto caught attention zhao popularly known cz responded use crypto sooner later meanwhile remains unclear whether directed comment dimon one statement predicting widespread bitcoin jpmorgan offer bitcoin crypto service ceodimon told cnbc jpmorgan would venture stablecoins plan firm earlier disclosed build earlier statement jpmorgan offer bitcoin crypto service jpmorgan increasingly exposed digital asset industry lately strategy tap promising sector context trillion financial institution announced partnership coinbase july allow client link bank account directly coinbase would also enable jpmorgan customer fund coinbase wallet directly bank use chase credit card trading platform per announcement former start latter debut fall dimon also disclosed may customer soon able buy bitcoin however noted jpmorgan provide custody service digital upside traditional cashthe jpmorgan ceo reiterated support stablecoins yesterday stating belief digital currency blockchain technology whole compared stablecoins mutual fund noting could share similar dimon highlighted stablecoins may advantage fiat offer certain utility traditional counterpart noted programmable allows automated reaffirmed personal believer bitcoin noted jpmorgan accommodate ceo emphasized company focus servicing customer personal dimon bitcoin skeptic called bitcoin fraud decentralized ponzi scheme even asked shutdown crypto industry core fuel antagonism belief bitcoin support illegal activity like money laundering sex trafficking however bitcoin thrived regardless widespread adoption forcing dimon hand allow customer dimon stablecoin acceptance echo seen united state congress passed genius act july donald trump signing legislation day later,0.059,0.791,0.15,0.9726,1
2025-08-01 09:08:03,49354563,1754039283,Famous crypto analysts back this $0.035 coin to hit $3 before Q2 2026,"Some prominent voices in the space are going so far as to project a $3 valuation by Q2 2026‚Äîan ~85x move from today‚Äôs price. What makes such a forecast more than just hype is the growing credibility of the protocol‚Äôs mechanics. Unlike typical presales fueled by buzz and nothing more, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building out real infrastructure for DeFi lending, borrowing, and passive income‚Äîcore functions that drive protocol-level revenue. As more investors seek platforms that offer both scalability and real-world yield, this emerging ecosystem is becoming harder to ignore. Utilities that fuel the $3 forecast A key driver behind bullish price expectations is the protocol‚Äôs upcoming beta launch, which will go live alongside the official listing. Designed to run on a Layer-2 network, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer cheaper and faster transactions without sacrificing decentralization. This makes the platform more suitable for everyday DeFi users who want reliable, cost-effective access to lending markets. One standout feature is the stablecoin system directly tied to borrowing. Whenever a user takes a loan, a stablecoin is minted, and once repayment is complete, the token is burned. This design ensures tight supply control, drastically reducing inflation risk. Unlike other DeFi stablecoins that over-issue supply, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures that every dollar in circulation has a lending action behind it. The platform‚Äôs P2C (Peer-to-Contract) lending system will offer users a streamlined way to earn predictable returns. For example, a user who deposits 100 SOL (~$7,000) into the lending pool can expect to earn around 10.5% APY, translating to $735 annually in passive income. This model attracts both new investors and long-term crypto holders looking to maximize yield without needing to time market exits. For more advanced users, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also include a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) lending path. Here, users can negotiate loan terms directly, targeting exotic collateral or higher-yield opportunities. This opens up access to tokens not traditionally supported in pooled contracts, making it ideal for lenders willing to take on more risk for higher returns. Presale snapshot and time-sensitive opportunity The presale is now in Phase 6, with tokens priced at $0.035 and only 7% of the 170 million allocation sold so far. Momentum is growing rapidly, with over $13.8 million already raised and more than 14,700 individual holders onboard. When Phase 7 kicks in, the price will climb to $0.040‚Äîa 15% jump that creates an obvious incentive to act now rather than later. Earlier backers who entered during Phase 1 at just $0.01 are already up 250%, and those who exchanged assets like AVAX during that period now hold over 3x gains, even before the token hits exchanges. With a listing price set at $0.060, Phase 6 buyers stand to gain over 70% at launch, and the upside only compounds beyond that. Post exchange listing like on Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, the platform will gain more traction, and more users will be aware of the real utility shared by this project, ultimately increasing the MUTM demand and hence driving the price up. Beyond price action, the project is also investing heavily in security and community. The $50K CertiK bug bounty program is live, and audit scores are impressive: a 95 on Token Scan and a 78 on Skynet. A $100K giveaway is also underway, where 10 winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, helping to fuel buzz across its growing audience. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now boasts over 12,000 Twitter followers, signaling early-stage community strength and viral potential ahead of full launch. With whales already accumulating and analysts calling for a future valuation near $3, the opportunity here feels less like speculation and more like smart positioning. At $0.035, even a conservative $0.60 listing would mean 17x‚Äîare you really going to watch it from the sidelines?

2025-08-01 09:06:09,49362761,1754039169,SEC Chair Vows to Establish Clear Crypto Rules in ‚ÄòProject Crypto‚Äô Overhaul,"The SEC Chair Paul Atkins has vowed to establish a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets, highlighting this as his top priority to position the U.S. as a global blockchain leader. The 34th United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Paul Atkins, noted that the ""Project Crypto"" initiative aims to modernize outdated securities rules and secure the U.S.‚Äôs position as a global leader in blockchain innovation. Atkins announced this on Thursday during a policy address in Washington.Bringing Clarity to Crypto RegulationHe emphasized the need for ‚Äúbright-line rules‚Äù that allow businesses to determine whether their crypto assets fall under securities laws or other classifications such as digital collectibles, commodities, or stablecoins.Atkins emphasized that being designated as a security should not be viewed negatively, as it can give investors added benefits such as voting rights and access to distributions.¬†As part of the reform, the SEC plans to introduce specific disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors for token offerings, including ICOs, airdrops, and network-based rewards.Rebuilding Domestic Crypto MarketsThe SEC Chair criticized the trend of crypto projects moving offshore to avoid legal uncertainty in the U.S. He said the SEC aims to reverse that by encouraging innovation within American borders.Furthermore, the SEC plans to support the tokenization of traditional financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds. Atkins revealed that many firms, including Wall Street giants and Silicon Valley tech startups, are ready to enter the U.S. crypto market if regulatory clarity improves.More Options for Custody and TradingMeanwhile, another central goal is to expand investor choices for where and how to hold and trade crypto assets. Atkins emphasized the importance of self-custody and directed the SEC staff to modernize custody rules for registered intermediaries.He also criticized past SEC policies like SAB 121 and ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0,‚Äù which limited the number of qualified custodial providers. New guidance could offer relief and reduce regulatory friction.Paving the Way for Super-AppsAtkins also wants to make it easier for platforms to operate as ‚Äúsuper-apps‚Äù offering multiple financial services under one regulatory structure.A broker-dealer, for example, should be able to offer trading in crypto securities, non-security tokens, traditional stocks, lending, and staking, all with a single license. He said the SEC would work with other regulators to streamline licensing and avoid duplicative compliance burdens.Unlocking On-Chain InnovationAs part of the project crypto, the SEC will also update rules to accommodate decentralized finance (DeFi) and other on-chain software systems. Atkins said both centralized and decentralized protocols should have a place in U.S. markets.He also suggested revisiting Regulation NMS to enable on-chain trading of tokenized securities, arguing that legacy frameworks should not stifle innovation.Creating Space for Risk-Taking and New IdeasMeanwhile, to foster faster innovation, the SEC Chair proposed a new ‚Äúinnovation exemption.‚Äù This would allow startups to go to market quickly under principles-based rules rather than rigid regulatory requirements.Conditions could include regular reporting, use of compliant token standards, and restricted distribution to verified users. The goal is to ensure that business models with economic potential can launch without being blocked by red tape.Atkins concluded by affirming the SEC‚Äôs commitment to transforming U.S. capital markets to accommodate blockchain technology and digital assets. The SEC is expected to release additional guidance and proposals in the coming months as Project Crypto takes shape.Meanwhile, Atkins had earlier noted that crypto is now firmly part of the U.S. financial system , pointing to President Trump‚Äôs signing of the GENIUS Act as a key step toward regulatory clarity. He called it a major shift from past policies and noted that stablecoins could modernize the country‚Äôs outdated settlement system.",Market|Latest SEC Cryptocurrency News,EN,1,sec chair paul atkins vowed establish clear regulatory framework crypto asset highlighting top priority position global blockchain leader united state security exchange commission sec chair paul atkins noted project crypto initiative aim modernize outdated security rule secure position global leader blockchain innovation atkins announced thursday policy address clarity crypto regulationhe emphasized need rule allow business determine whether crypto asset fall security law classification digital collectible commodity emphasized designated security viewed negatively give investor added benefit voting right access distribution part reform sec plan introduce specific disclosure exemption safe harbor token offering including icos airdrop domestic crypto marketsthe sec chair criticized trend crypto project moving offshore avoid legal uncertainty said sec aim reverse encouraging innovation within american sec plan support tokenization traditional financial instrument stock bond atkins revealed many firm including wall street giant silicon valley tech startup ready enter crypto market regulatory clarity option custody tradingmeanwhile another central goal expand investor choice hold trade crypto asset atkins emphasized importance directed sec staff modernize custody rule registered also criticized past sec policy like sab operation chokepoint limited number qualified custodial provider new guidance could offer relief reduce regulatory way also want make easier platform operate offering multiple financial service one regulatory example able offer trading crypto security token traditional stock lending staking single license said sec would work regulator streamline licensing avoid duplicative compliance innovationas part project crypto sec also update rule accommodate decentralized finance defi software system atkins said centralized decentralized protocol place also suggested revisiting regulation nm enable trading tokenized security arguing legacy framework stifle space new ideasmeanwhile foster faster innovation sec chair proposed new innovation would allow startup go market quickly rule rather rigid regulatory could include regular reporting use compliant token standard restricted distribution verified user goal ensure business model economic potential launch without blocked red concluded affirming sec commitment transforming capital market accommodate blockchain technology digital asset sec expected release additional guidance proposal coming month project crypto take atkins earlier noted crypto firmly part financial system pointing president trump signing genius act key step toward regulatory clarity called major shift past policy noted stablecoins could modernize country outdated settlement system,0.049,0.721,0.23,0.9964,1
2025-08-01 09:05:33,49352141,1754039133,Analyst to XRP Holders: This Is My Final Warning. We‚Äôre About to Get Extremely Rich,"The altcoin market appears to be entering a new phase of momentum, and one analyst believes XRP is positioned for significant gains. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a seasoned market analyst on X, posted a chart highlighting the shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins. The chart suggests that XRP could benefit from what he identifies as a developing altcoin season. He accompanied the image with a message directed at XRP investors, writing, ‚ÄúThis is my final warning. We‚Äôre about to get extremely rich.‚Äù Dear #XRP holders, This is my final warning. We're about to get extremely rich. pic.twitter.com/8NsdPJJXLM ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 31, 2025 Altcoin Index Indicates Market Shift The chart Steph posted is based on the Altcoin Year chart, which measures the percentage of top-performing altcoins that are outperforming Bitcoin. The scale runs from 0 to 100. A value below 25 indicates Bitcoin season, meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. A value above 75 signals altcoin season , when the majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Currently, the index is at 29, just above the Bitcoin year threshold. This suggests that while Bitcoin dominance remains strong, a shift toward altcoin outperformance is beginning. Steph views this movement as a precursor to significant altcoin gains, and he believes XRP will be a major beneficiary of this trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Identified as a Leading Token in the Cycle Steph has previously shared similar charts tracking the Altcoin Season Index . This latest update aligns with his ongoing thesis that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is weakening, while altcoins, especially XRP, are poised to outperform. Although much of the market‚Äôs momentum this year has been driven by Bitcoin, this shift suggests that altcoins will soon take over the market. His chart also suggests that XRP will play a crucial role as momentum shifts toward altcoins. While Ethereum has been the most prominent altcoin for years, XRP has outperformed it for much of 2025 . If XRP can sustain this momentum, it may flip Ethereum , regaining its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency and largest altcoin, and pushing the market into a new altcoin year. XRP Investors Are Watching for a Breakout Opportunity Steph‚Äôs post has placed XRP in the spotlight as market conditions begin to favor altcoins. With the altcoin year index starting to rise, investors are monitoring XRP closely for signs of upward momentum. The current positioning suggests that XRP could move early in the next phase of the cycle, and holders are watching for a clear breakout to confirm this potential shift.

A white-label blockchain platform is a pre-built, customizable solution that lets you launch blockchain services under your own brand. From exchanges and wallets to NFT marketplaces and even full blockchain networks, these providers handle the tech, while you focus on branding and user experience. It‚Äôs perfect for companies without in-house developers. Most platforms include APIs, admin dashboards, token creation tools, and essential security features. Many also offer extras like fiat on-ramps, compliance modules, and liquidity integrations. Why Use a White-Label Blockchain Solution? Throughout the past couple of years, I‚Äôve noticed that white-label platforms are gaining popularity. Here‚Äôs why they make sense: Faster Launches: Go live in weeks instead of months. Lower Costs: Skip the hefty R&D and infrastructure spend. Full Customization: Tailor everything from branding to features. Built-In Compliance: Many include KYC/AML tools and legal frameworks. Effortless Scalability: Easily onboard users and expand across regions. Whether you‚Äôre building a DeFi platform, a GameFi app, or a crypto payment system, I think that white-label solutions can potentially help you get there faster. 5 Pro Tips for Choosing the Right White-Label Blockchain Platform Not all white-label platforms are built the same. Here are five key factors to consider before making your pick: Look Beyond the Basics A good platform should offer more than just swaps or wallets. I think it‚Äôs important to prioritize solutions with scalable features like staking, NFT support, fiat integration, and multi-chain compatibility. The broader the toolkit, the better your chances of future-proofing your product. Security Comes First Security should always come first and features mean nothing without it. It‚Äôs critical that you make sure the provider is following best practices. These include cold wallet storage, two-factor authentication, DDoS protection, as well as regular smart contract audits. Does it Follow Regulations? Regulations vary by region, so choose a platform that takes compliance seriously. Remember ‚Äì you are taking their solution and using it as is. Therefore, I would suggest considering solutions with built-in KYC/AML tools, audit logs, and access to legal support, especially if you‚Äôre targeting global markets or fiat integrations. Customer Reviews are Important Don‚Äôt just take the company‚Äôs word for it. Take a proper look at client reviews, case studies, and testimonials to determine whether the platform is stable and if the post-launch quality is up to your own standards. After all, this is what your own customers will be using, so it‚Äôs paramount that you‚Äôre fully aware of all of its bells and whistles. Responsive Support Matters No matter how great the tech is, things will eventually break. A knowledgeable, responsive support team can make or break your launch timeline. Look for platforms that offer 24/7 technical help and real onboarding assistance, not just a ticket system or an AI-based chatbot that will respond automatically, providing little to no help at all. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How much does it cost to use a white-label blockchain platform? Prices can range from as low as $5,000 for basic API-based tools to over $100,000 for fully featured exchange infrastructure. The cost depends on your use case, customization needs, and technical complexity. Can I create my own crypto exchange? Yes. With a white-label solution, you can launch a crypto exchange in just a few weeks using pre-built trading engines, liquidity integrations, and user management systems. What is the cheapest white-label blockchain platform? Platforms like HollaEx and Coinsclone are popular for their affordability. Open-source options (like HollaEx) often come with lower upfront costs but may require more hands-on setup. What is the best white-label blockchain solution provider? It depends on your project. ChangeNOW is good for quick, non-custodial swaps. Blockchain App Factory is great for full-scale exchange and NFT infrastructure. Velmie suits fintechs and remittance platforms. Choose based on your business model, target users, and technical resources.

2025-08-01 09:01:48,49353261,1754038908,Mutuum Finance forecast: can a $200 investment in MUTM help you retire by 2029?,"Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing rapid growth in its presale, now in phase 6 of 11, with tokens priced at $0.035. This phase is selling out quickly, offering investors a final opportunity to secure tokens before a 14.3% price hike to $0.04 in phase 7. The project has raised $13,800,000, with over 660 million tokens distributed among 14,700 holders. Buying now guarantees a 71% return on investment at the $0.06 launch price. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders. This initiative is fostering strong community engagement. Transitioning to its innovative features, the project‚Äôs lending model sets it apart. Innovative lending and security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a dual-lending ecosystem, combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models on a layer-2 blockchain. This structure is reducing gas fees significantly, enhancing accessibility for users. Lenders can pool assets like BTC or stablecoins, earning up to 12% annual percentage yield, while risk-tolerant investors can negotiate terms using memecoins as collateral. The platform‚Äôs overcollateralized stablecoin system ensures stability by minting and burning tokens based on loan activity. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, achieving a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities detected. A $50,000 bug bounty program, split across severity tiers, further strengthens its security framework. This robust foundation supports the project‚Äôs growth potential, leading to its price outlook. Price prediction and historical comparison Analysts are forecasting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $2.50 by 2029, driven by its capped 4 billion token supply and increasing demand in the crypto market. A $200 investment at $0.035 secures 5,714 tokens, potentially worth $14,285 at $2.50, a 7,042% return. This projection mirrors Cardano (ADA) during 2020-2021, when it soared from $0.03 to $3.10 in 18 months, delivering a 10,233% return on investment. While Cardano benefited from broader market trends, its growth relied on speculative hype rather than Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs tangible lending utility. The layer-2 efficiency and stablecoin system position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for sustained growth. Furthermore, a $100,000 giveaway , split among 10 winners, is boosting community excitement, requiring a $50 minimum presale investment to participate. These factors underscore Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs promising trajectory. Path to massive returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a compelling opportunity in the crypto investment space. Its presale momentum, innovative lending model, and robust security measures are driving investor confidence. A $200 investment could yield significant returns by 2029, potentially helping you retire rich, given the projected $2.50 price target. The project‚Äôs appeal is being increased by its layer-2 efficiency and community incentives, such as the $100,000 giveaway and rewards for the top 50 holders.

Prices have climbed steadily, and some traders think a fresh wave of buying could push XRP far above current levels. The move in Ethereum and BNB has set the stage. Now everyone is watching whether XRP can follow. Related Reading: Don‚Äôt Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You‚Äôve Made‚ÄîExpert Tight Range Could Fuel Breakout According to analyst Zach Rector, XRP has been trading in a narrow band just above $3.00. It recently sat around $3.15, giving it room to spring higher. Rector points out that a push above $3.25 could send XRP into the $4‚Äì$5 range ‚Äúany day now.‚Äù $4-$5 XRP any day now. $7-$15 by 9/7. pic.twitter.com/75Brfp06pQ ‚Äî Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) July 27, 2025 That jump would be about a 50% gain from today‚Äôs price. He even marks out a window from August 23 to September 7 for a bigger run toward $7 or higher. Ethereum‚Äôs surge is helping set the tone. Its price has climbed to about $3,940 while the market cap hit nearly $500 billion. BNB also made a splash, topping $850 for the first time. Those moves often drag other coins upward, and many believe XRP is next in line. Fibonacci Projections Based on weekly charts shared by Tony Edward of the Thinking Crypto Podcast, XRP has clear Fibonacci levels ahead. His targets range from $4.5 to $9.1. Those marks match up with Rector‚Äôs range, lending more weight to the idea that XRP is setting up for a big move. If XRP follows those lines, each level could act as a stepping stone. While Fibonacci is just one method, its overlap with Rector‚Äôs targets creates a story that traders can follow. It gives them clear numbers to watch and simple goals to aim for as the market moves. Related Reading: XRP ETF Approval Incoming? Analyst Eyes September-October Window Anything Can Happen Other market observers take a different take. They look back at XRP‚Äôs past rallies and figures current cycles could average out to about $20 per coin. In 2017, XRP rose a whopping 2,500%, which would imply a $30 peak today. In 2021 the altcoin jumped 500%, pointing to $7.70 as we speak. By averaging those two, a $20 target for this season could be on their crosshair. Even with bullish charts, risks are still there. Regulatory news around Ripple and the SEC can send prices tumbling overnight. If Bitcoin cools off or global markets turn sour, altcoins like XRP could get hit hard. Big holders also have power. If they decide to sell into strength, any rally could stall quickly.

Details","After a record-breaking performance in July, XRP has begun August on a more uncertain footing. The asset is now trading at $2.92, below the critical $3 support level identified by many traders. This recent 7.3% drop from the previous day has fueled renewed concern among community members, especially given the asset‚Äôs stalled momentum over the past two weeks. The chart shared by crypto analyst Steph (@Steph_iscrypto) on X outlines this decline, emphasizing the importance of the $3 zone as a key support. The analysis suggests that XRP‚Äôs failure to hold that level could weaken its bullish structure if not quickly reclaimed. Despite the current pullback, Steph‚Äôs projection still points toward significant upside potential. A sharp upward arrow in the chart indicates a long-term bullish trajectory that remains intact if conditions stabilize. #XRP losing support.. Should we worry? pic.twitter.com/7KtfZJ0wSU ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 1, 2025 A Look Back at 2025 Performance The year has been undeniably strong for XRP. It began the year in the middle of a remarkable rally and hit a multi-year peak of $3.39 in January. An extended consolidation phase followed, but the asset experienced another sharp breakout in July, reaching a new peak of $3.65 . Yet, the speed and height of the recent rally have also prompted caution among some traders. Some have interpreted the lack of follow-through after the breakout as a sign of potential exhaustion. While the current price action is not unusual within volatile crypto cycles, it contrasts sharply with the explosive move that preceded it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Temporary Weakness or Structural Breakdown? Despite the sharp correction, several analysts remain optimistic about XRP‚Äôs near-term outlook . Historical behavior shows that XRP has experienced multiple pullbacks below key levels, only to regain strength shortly after. After reaching its all-time high, XRP experienced a brief pullback but quickly regained the $3 level. The community expects it to do the same now. Some community members weighed in, advising others to buy the dip with the expectation that the asset will recover soon. Moreover, the broader macro environment could still favor digital assets. With interest rate cuts expected from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the asset‚Äôs long-term trajectory seems bullish, as liquidity may return to high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. This is not the first time the asset has slipped below a major level only to recover shortly after. XRP has historically demonstrated an ability to reclaim lost support and reestablish bullish momentum, even after brief periods of weakness.

2025-08-01 09:00:18,49352056,1754038818,"BlockDAG, ENA, HBAR, & XLM: Top-Performing Crypto Under $1 You Shouldn‚Äôt Overlook","Those looking for major upside at affordable price levels are finding plenty of action in 2025. Names like BlockDAG, Ethena (ENA), Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar (XLM) have started to draw more attention, thanks to strong technical setups, expanding ecosystems, and consistent momentum. Some are riding multi-week rallies, while others are gaining ground during presale phases that rival even post-listing activity. Although all are trading under a dollar, their fundamentals, rising volumes, and breakout patterns put them ahead of many higher-priced coins. If you‚Äôre tracking the top-performing crypto under $1, these four are well worth your attention. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0016 Until August 11 with $1 Targets Post Launch Currently priced at $0.0016 through August 11, BlockDAG (BDAG) isn‚Äôt just another low-cost crypto trying to get noticed. It‚Äôs showing one of the strongest setups in the under-$1 range. With over $356 million raised, 24.4 billion BDAG coins sold, and 28 batches completed, this presale is hitting record territory. Early participants have already captured a 2,660% return in batch 29. However, those buying now can still lock in a 3025% ROI by launch, due to the limited-time $0.0016 offer. Once the presale ends, BDAG will list at $0.05, securing that 3025% return. And that‚Äôs just the beginning. Forecasts after launch are looking toward the $1 mark, a move that would mean a 62,400% jump from its current price. This potential is not just speculation, it‚Äôs backed by actual adoption. BlockDAG uses a layer 1 structure powered by DAG technology, which enables faster transactions by running them in parallel instead of sequentially, cutting both time and cost. Its community is already growing fast, with more than 200,000 holders and 2.5 million users mining BDAG on the X1 mobile app. It‚Äôs not a project hoping for relevance after its exchange debut, it‚Äôs scaling before that ever happens. For those hunting top-performing crypto under $1, BlockDAG is one project not waiting to gain traction. It‚Äôs already gaining it. 2. Ethena (ENA): Heavy Trading Volume Pushes Price Toward $0.50 Ethena (ENA) has made its way back onto trader radars after nearly doubling in value, rising 98% in the past month. It‚Äôs now closing in on the $0.50 level, a zone that often triggers further action as psychological resistance comes into play. What makes ENA‚Äôs move stand out is the $2 billion in trading volume in a single day, a rare number for a crypto in this price category. This isn‚Äôt just random interest, that volume shows strong commitment. Even if ENA cools off in the short term, its current activity earns it a solid place among the top-performing crypto under $1 worth monitoring closely. 3. Hedera (HBAR): Quietly Climbing with Nearly $1B in Daily Volume Hedera (HBAR) is trading near $0.2740 after building a 95% gain over the past month, reclaiming price levels it hadn‚Äôt touched in a long time. It‚Äôs not just the price rise that matters here. Daily volume has climbed to just under $1 billion, indicating that buyers aren‚Äôt just retail traders chasing spikes. HBAR‚Äôs recent move suggests the market is giving more attention to its hashgraph-based system, which provides an alternative to blockchain by improving speed and consensus methods. Broader trends might still shape its pace, but HBAR is making a serious case to be ranked among the top-performing crypto under $1 gaining steam this summer. 4. Stellar (XLM): A Clean Breakout from Long-Term Stagnation After a long stretch of flat trading, Stellar (XLM) is finally showing signs of strength. It‚Äôs now up more than 95% over the past 30 days and is testing the $0.50 ceiling. The move has been supported by rising volume, which recently came close to $900 million in 24-hour trades. XLM has broken above a lengthy consolidation range, a technical shift that may point to a deeper change in market sentiment. If it clears the $0.50 mark decisively, the door could open to new bullish setups. Within the group of top-performing crypto under $1, Stellar appears ready to start a more active phase. Which of These Is Really Breaking Through the Noise? Ethena‚Äôs volume push, Hedera‚Äôs ongoing price lift, and Stellar‚Äôs breakout all bring something to the table. But BlockDAG‚Äôs massive presale progress, $356 million raised, 200,000 holders, and a 3025% return window, resets the conversation. It‚Äôs also the only layer 1 crypto in this group that‚Äôs still in presale and priced this low at just $0.0016 until August 11. All four coins are showing promise among top-performing crypto under $1, but BlockDAG is already generating the kind of movement that usually happens only after listings.

2025-08-01 09:00:14,49352104,1754038814,"Apple‚Äôs China revenue hits $15.4 billion, beating expectations","Apple recorded its first sales increase in China in two years, driven by rising demand for Mac computers and iPhones. In the June quarter, the tech giant‚Äôs China revenue rose 4.4% to $15.4 billion, slightly ahead of the $15.2 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Chinese consumers drove double-digit growth in Apple‚Äôs Mac category by snapping up the MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro. CEO Tim Cook said the Air was China‚Äôs top-selling notebook, with the Mini leading among desktops. Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh also stated the iPhone was a top performer in urban China, referencing data from Worldpanel. Cook noted that government subsidies on smartphones and other electronic devices may have supported consumer demand. In January, China extended its national trade-in program that initially targeted home appliances and vehicles, including personal electronics like smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. He also confirmed that new consumers in China were particularly drawn to the Mac, iPad, and watch, rather than its flagship iPhones. He commented, ‚ÄúAcross Mac, iPad, and Watch, most customers in mainland China were first-time buyers. So lots of good things there.‚Äù Nevertheless, according to the IDC, Apple only saw a 1.3% drop in iPhone shipments in China last quarter, outperforming the broader market‚Äôs 4% decline. Tariffs and trade-in programs shape Apple‚Äôs earnings outlook Apple‚Äôs overall revenue in the June quarter surged 9.6% to $94 billion , beating Bloomberg‚Äôs average of $89.3 billion. The company also estimated that its revenue would rise by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage for the current quarter, topping the 3% growth anticipated by analysts. According to Cook, the revenue growth in the June quarter was attributed to increased product sales in Greater China and other emerging markets. He added that US tariffs drove up their spending costs, although they also boosted sales last quarter as consumers hurried to buy ahead of anticipated price hikes. The Cupertino, California-based company had estimated a $900 million tariff burden with only modest revenue growth for the last quarter. The company later reported that the tariffs cost them $800 million. Apple, however, anticipates a bigger expenditure, about $1.1 billion in related expenses from the levies imposed for the current quarter. Services and iPhones drive record revenue amid AI concerns Nonetheless, the services division continues to lead the company‚Äôs growth, posting a 13% year-over-year increase to $27.4 billion in the June quarter. However, the unit is under increasing pressure. Global regulators are targeting App Store practices that could diminish income from apps and subscriptions. At the same time, a US Justice Department case may jeopardize its lucrative default search deal with Google, which earns the company about $20 billion annually. The company also accrued over $44.6 billion from iPhone sales during the June quarter, topping estimates of $40.1 billion. However, the firm is concerned that consumers could eventually gravitate toward screen-free AI devices, potentially undermining the iPhone‚Äôs dominance. Cook remarked, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to see a world where iPhones are not living in it, and that doesn‚Äôt mean that we are not thinking about other things as well, but I think that the devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitution.‚Äù Meanwhile, the iPhone maker made $8.05 billion from its Mac sales, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $7.3 billion.

2025-08-01 09:00:12,49351905,1754038812,US Dollar Surges: A Crucial Week for Global Economy and Non-Farm Payrolls,"BitcoinWorld US Dollar Surges: A Crucial Week for Global Economy and Non-Farm Payrolls The financial world is abuzz as the US Dollar marks an extraordinary milestone, poised for its best weekly performance in three years. This significant surge is not just a headline for currency traders; it sends ripples across every corner of the financial landscape, including the volatile realm of cryptocurrencies. For those invested in digital assets, understanding the underlying forces driving this dollar dominance is paramount, as macro-economic shifts often dictate the ebb and flow of capital in and out of riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. What‚Äôs truly driving this impressive run, and how will the highly anticipated Non-Farm Payrolls report shape its future trajectory and the broader global economy ? Understanding the Unprecedented US Dollar Surge The recent ascent of the US Dollar has been nothing short of remarkable, captivating analysts and investors alike. Its journey to becoming the strongest performer among major currencies this week is a culmination of several powerful economic and geopolitical factors. This isn‚Äôt just about a single event; it‚Äôs about a confluence of circumstances that have positioned the dollar as a preferred asset globally. What are the primary catalysts behind this impressive Dollar strength ? Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve‚Äôs proactive stance on monetary policy has played a pivotal role. While other major central banks, like the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, have maintained a more cautious or dovish approach, the Fed has been relatively more aggressive in its efforts to combat inflation. Higher interest rates in the US make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors seeking better returns. This creates a ‚Äòcarry trade‚Äô opportunity, where investors borrow in low-interest currencies and invest in higher-interest dollar assets, driving up demand for the greenback. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of heightened global uncertainty, whether stemming from geopolitical tensions, economic slowdown fears in major economies like China or Europe, or financial market volatility, the US Dollar traditionally acts as a safe haven. Investors flock to the dollar, US Treasuries, and other dollar-denominated assets as a store of value, perceiving them as less risky during turbulent periods. This flight to quality inherently boosts dollar demand. US Economic Resilience: Despite global headwinds, the US economy has shown surprising resilience. Robust labor market data, consistent consumer spending, and relatively stable corporate earnings have painted a picture of an economy that, while facing challenges, is performing better than many of its global counterparts. This relative strength makes the US an attractive destination for foreign investment, further bolstering the dollar. Comparing the dollar‚Äôs performance against other major currencies, such as the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound, highlights this divergence. The Euro has grappled with recession fears and energy crises, the Yen with ultra-loose monetary policy, and the Pound with its own set of inflation and growth challenges. Against this backdrop, the dollar‚Äôs relative appeal has intensified, cementing its position as a dominant force in the forex market. The Pivotal Role of Non-Farm Payrolls : What to Expect? While the factors above provide a foundation for the dollar‚Äôs current strength, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. This monthly release from the US Department of Labor is arguably one of the most anticipated and impactful pieces of economic data on the global calendar. What exactly are Non-Farm Payrolls? The NFP report provides a comprehensive snapshot of the health of the US labor market, specifically measuring the number of new jobs created in the non-agricultural sectors during the previous month. It also includes crucial details such as the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings, which are key indicators of wage inflation. For policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the NFP is a critical input for their monetary policy decisions, as a strong labor market can signal inflationary pressures, potentially prompting further interest rate hikes. The market‚Äôs hypersensitivity to the NFP data stems from its direct implications for interest rates. A robust NFP report, indicating strong job growth, often leads to expectations of higher interest rates, which in turn strengthens the dollar. Conversely, a weak report can signal economic slowdown, leading to expectations of lower rates or even rate cuts, thereby weakening the dollar. Let‚Äôs consider the potential scenarios for the upcoming NFP report and their likely impact: NFP Result Interpretation Expected Dollar Reaction Fed Policy Implication Strong NFP (Above Expectations) Robust job growth, potential inflationary pressure. Significant Dollar strength , bond yields rise. Increases likelihood of further rate hikes. Weak NFP (Below Expectations) Slowing job market, economic slowdown concerns. US Dollar weakness, bond yields fall. Decreases likelihood of rate hikes, raises possibility of cuts. Mixed NFP (e.g., strong jobs, weak wages) Nuanced outlook, market uncertainty. Initial volatility, then reaction based on dominant factor. Fed maintains ‚Äòdata-dependent‚Äô stance, market seeks clarity. The market will not only focus on the headline jobs number but also scrutinize average hourly earnings, as wage growth is a direct indicator of inflationary pressures. A higher-than-expected wage growth, even with moderate job creation, can still fuel dollar strength by signaling persistent inflation. Beyond Payrolls: How Broader Economic Data Fuels Dollar Strength While Non-Farm Payrolls capture immediate attention, the dollar‚Äôs sustained strength is also deeply rooted in a broader array of economic data . These indicators collectively paint a comprehensive picture of the US economy‚Äôs health relative to the rest of the global economy , influencing investor sentiment and capital flows. What other crucial economic indicators are at play? Inflation Data (CPI, PPI): The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) measure inflation at the consumer and producer levels, respectively. Persistent high inflation figures in the US, especially when compared to more subdued inflation in other major economies, reinforce the Federal Reserve‚Äôs need to maintain a hawkish stance, supporting the dollar. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth: GDP measures the total economic output of a country. Strong GDP growth indicates a healthy and expanding economy, which attracts foreign investment and strengthens the national currency. If the US consistently outperforms other major economies in terms of growth, it naturally bolsters the dollar. Retail Sales: This report tracks consumer spending, a significant component of GDP in consumer-driven economies like the US. Robust retail sales suggest strong consumer confidence and economic momentum, contributing to positive economic outlook and dollar appreciation. Manufacturing and Services PMIs: Purchasing Managers‚Äô Indexes (PMIs) for both manufacturing and services sectors are leading indicators of economic activity. Strong PMI readings suggest expanding business activity, job creation, and future economic growth, providing further support for the US Dollar . Consumer Confidence: Surveys measuring consumer sentiment about current and future economic conditions can provide insights into spending patterns. High consumer confidence often translates to increased spending, contributing to economic growth. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs approach is often described as ‚Äòdata-dependent.‚Äô This means their decisions on interest rates and monetary policy are heavily influenced by the latest incoming economic statistics. If the aggregate of these data points suggests persistent inflation and a resilient economy, the Fed is more likely to continue with tighter monetary policy, which, in turn, underpins Dollar strength . Conversely, signs of significant economic weakness across these indicators could prompt a pivot towards a more dovish stance, potentially softening the dollar‚Äôs rally. Understanding this intricate web of economic indicators is essential for anyone tracking the dollar, as it‚Äôs not just about one report but the cumulative weight of all data points shaping the Fed‚Äôs outlook and, consequently, the dollar‚Äôs value. The Ripple Effect: How Dollar Strength Impacts the Global Economy and Your Portfolio The formidable Dollar strength we are witnessing does not occur in a vacuum; its effects reverberate throughout the entire global economy , creating winners and losers, and significantly influencing various asset classes, including the increasingly interconnected cryptocurrency markets. How does a strong dollar ripple through the global financial system? Impact on Emerging Markets: Many emerging market countries and corporations have dollar-denominated debt. As the dollar strengthens, the cost of servicing and repaying this debt increases significantly in their local currencies. This can lead to financial strain, capital outflows, and even sovereign debt crises in vulnerable economies. Commodities Pricing: Major commodities like oil, gold, and industrial metals are typically priced in US Dollars. When the dollar strengthens, these commodities become more expensive for buyers using other currencies, which can lead to a decrease in demand and, consequently, lower commodity prices in dollar terms. This inverse relationship is a critical dynamic for commodity-exporting nations and global inflation. International Trade: A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing demand for American goods and services. Conversely, it makes imports cheaper for US consumers, which can lead to an increase in imports and potentially widen the US trade deficit. Corporate Earnings for Multinationals: US-based multinational corporations that generate a significant portion of their revenue overseas often see their foreign earnings devalued when converted back into a stronger dollar. This can negatively impact their reported earnings and stock performance. Is Your Crypto Portfolio Prepared for Sustained Dollar Dominance? For cryptocurrency investors, the dollar‚Äôs ascendancy is a particularly important trend to monitor. While crypto markets often operate on their own unique narratives, they are not immune to macro-economic forces. A strong dollar typically correlates with a ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô sentiment in global markets. Risk-Off Sentiment: When global economic uncertainty rises and the dollar acts as a safe haven, investors tend to reduce their exposure to riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, despite their innovative nature, are still largely perceived as high-risk, high-reward investments. This means capital can flow out of crypto into more traditional, safer assets like the dollar and US Treasuries. Liquidity Drain: A strong dollar can absorb liquidity from other markets. If investors are selling assets denominated in other currencies to buy dollars, or simply holding cash in dollars, it can reduce the available capital for investment in more speculative markets, including crypto. Stablecoin Dynamics: While stablecoins like USDT or USDC are pegged to the US Dollar , their underlying collateral and the regulatory environment surrounding them are still subject to scrutiny. A strong dollar doesn‚Äôt directly impact their peg but highlights the reliance of the crypto ecosystem on the stability of fiat currencies. Understanding these correlations is vital. While Bitcoin has often been touted as ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô and an inflation hedge, its performance in recent periods of dollar strength suggests it still largely behaves as a risk asset, sensitive to broader macroeconomic shifts. Navigating a Dominant US Dollar : Actionable Insights for Investors In a world where the US Dollar is demonstrating formidable Dollar strength , investors across various asset classes must adapt their strategies. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned forex trader, an equity investor, or deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding how to navigate this environment is key to protecting and growing your capital. For Forex Traders: Monitor Interest Rate Differentials: Keep a close eye on central bank policies globally. The widening gap between US interest rates and those of other major economies will continue to be a primary driver of dollar movements. Technical Analysis: While fundamentals drive long-term trends, technical analysis can help identify entry and exit points. Look for key support and resistance levels for dollar pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY). Risk Management: Volatility can be high around major economic data releases like Non-Farm Payrolls . Employ strict stop-loss orders and manage position sizes to mitigate potential losses. For Equity Investors: Focus on Domestic Revenue: Companies that generate a significant portion of their revenue domestically may be less impacted by a strong dollar, as their foreign earnings won‚Äôt be subject to adverse currency conversions. Defensive Sectors: Consider sectors traditionally viewed as defensive, such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, which tend to be less sensitive to economic cycles and currency fluctuations. Hedging Strategies: Larger institutional investors or corporations with significant international exposure might consider currency hedging strategies to mitigate the impact of dollar appreciation on their foreign investments or revenues. For Crypto Investors: Understand Macro Correlations: Recognize that while crypto has unique drivers, it is not entirely decoupled from traditional financial markets. A strong dollar and risk-off sentiment can put downward pressure on crypto prices. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio beyond just cryptocurrencies. Holding a portion of your assets in stablecoins, or even traditional safe-haven assets, can provide a buffer during periods of high dollar strength. Long-Term Conviction vs. Short-Term Volatility: If you believe in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies, short-term macro-driven pullbacks can be viewed as accumulation opportunities. However, be prepared for sustained volatility. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making large lump-sum investments, DCA involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of market fluctuations. This strategy can help mitigate the risk of investing all your capital at an unfavorable exchange rate against the dollar. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global macroeconomic trends, central bank announcements, and key economic data releases. This knowledge empowers you to make more informed decisions about your crypto investments within the broader context of the global economy . Ultimately, navigating a period of dollar dominance requires vigilance, adaptability, and a comprehensive understanding of how interconnected global financial markets truly are. The ability to pivot strategies based on evolving economic realities will be crucial for success. The US Dollar ‚Äòs impressive surge, marking its best week in three years, underscores its pivotal role in the global economy . Driven by proactive interest rate policies, its enduring safe-haven appeal, and the relative resilience of the US economy, the dollar‚Äôs strength is a defining characteristic of current financial markets. The impending Non-Farm Payrolls report looms as a critical determinant, with its outcome poised to significantly influence Federal Reserve policy and further shape the dollar‚Äôs trajectory. Beyond NFP, a broad spectrum of economic data continuously informs the dollar‚Äôs valuation, from inflation figures to GDP growth and consumer confidence. This sustained Dollar strength sends widespread ripples, impacting emerging markets, commodity prices, international trade, and, crucially, the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For investors across all asset classes, understanding these intricate dynamics and adapting strategies accordingly ‚Äì whether through diversification, vigilant monitoring of macro trends, or thoughtful risk management ‚Äì is essential to navigate this powerful currency shift successfully. The dollar‚Äôs journey is far from over, and its continued dominance demands careful attention from all market participants.

Strategy‚Äôs market positioning is stark‚Äîninth in operating income among S&P 500 firms but ranked 96th by market cap. Meanwhile, Saylor joined calls for a clear crypto regulatory taxonomy, very similar to other industry-wide demands for legal clarity as the US prepares to debate the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act in September. Strategy the Most Misunderstood Stock? Strategy, the Bitcoin-focused company that was co-founded by Michael Saylor, reported a record $10 billion in profit for the second quarter of 2025, yet its shares slipped 1.4% in after-hours trading. CEO Phong Le defended the company‚Äôs position by calling it ‚Äúthe most misunderstood and undervalued stock in the market.‚Äù Strategy stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Operating income surged an eye-popping 7,100% year-on-year to $14 billion, fueled in part by the firm‚Äôs adoption of fair value accounting, which includes unrealized gains from its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy holds 628,791 BTC, which is now valued at approximately $73.3 billion, and reported a 25% increase in its BTC yield. This metric compares its Bitcoin holdings to its assumed diluted shares. Additionally, the company saw a $13 billion gain in BTC value. In a bold move to increase its crypto treasury even more, Strategy announced plans to raise $4.2 billion via its Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, trading under the ticker STRC. The capital will be used to buy more Bitcoin as part of the company‚Äôs ‚Äú42/42‚Äù plan to accumulate $84 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. This follows a recent $2.5 billion raise through STRC earlier in July, which funded the purchase of 21,021 BTC . At current prices, the new raise could add another 36,128 BTC to Strategy‚Äôs balance sheet. Phong Le pointed out that Strategy now ranks ninth in estimated operating income among S&P 500 companies, yet only holds the 96th-largest market cap and has one of the lowest P/E ratios in the index. He argued that these disparities prove just how undervalued the market perceives Strategy to be. Despite modest revenue from its software business arm‚Äî$114 million for the quarter‚ÄîStrategy is doubling down on its Bitcoin-centric strategy by raising its full-year targets for BTC yield and dollar gain to 30% and $20 billion, respectively. According to Le, ‚ÄúAny company that is able to double their targets throughout the course of the year, you would consider that a success.‚Äù Michael Saylor Also Pushes for Crypto Clarity Strategy's Michael Saylor also recently added his voice to the growing calls for the United States to establish a clear legal framework for digital assets. During Strategy‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call , Saylor placed a lot of emphasis on the need for a formal crypto taxonomy that will define the distinctions between tokenized securities, digital commodities, and digital assets without issuers. ‚ÄúIt will be beneficial to the market if they nail down the digital assets taxonomy,‚Äù he said, mentioning the regulatory ambiguity that continues to hamper innovation and clarity across the industry. Michael Saylor The push for clarity is taking place during a time of pressure from crypto leaders and increasing momentum in Washington. The White House Working Group on Digital Asset Markets recently urged regulators to move faster when it comes to establishing rules around custody, trading, and token issuance. SEC Chair Paul Atkins acknowledged that regulatory hurdles are driving tokenization innovation overseas, but also pointed out that US companies are ‚Äúlined up at our doors‚Äù seeking approvals. Additionally, Atkins indicated that the SEC will offer regulatory relief where appropriate to ensure that the US stays competitive in the digital asset landscape. Speech from Paul Atkins (Source: SEC ) Congress is now preparing to review the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 in September, a bill that Saylor believes could unlock massive potential for businesses to participate in blockchain-based financial systems. He envisioned a future where ‚Äú40 million businesses could issue a token in four hours for $40,‚Äù which drastically lowers the barrier to on-chain finance. Robinhood is already capitalizing on this trend. CEO Vladimir Tenev revealed an aggressive push into tokenizing private market assets. Tenev said the goal is to democratize access to high-value investments like private equity, traditionally reserved for institutional players. The company already issued tokens in Europe tied to firms like OpenAI and SpaceX. However, these moves did already attract some regulatory scrutiny , including a legal inquiry in Lithuania and criticism from OpenAI, which stated that Robinhood‚Äôs token has no affiliation with its actual equity.

Penguin-themed tokens are already flying high, with PENGU emerging as one of the top-performing assets in the meme coin space.

Bitcoin‚Äôs rally, fueled by unprecedented institutional inflows this year, has lifted the entire market. And the altseason index makes it clear: the next major capital rotation is underway. PENGU has been an early winner, but after a 130% surge in the past month, the upside may be limited. That‚Äôs where Bitcoin Penguins steps in; the token offers fresh upside potential in a market that‚Äôs actively chasing the next breakout. With meme coin sentiment red-hot, the altcoin market pumping, and a clear roadmap ahead, Bitcoin Penguins looks like an ‚Äúall gas, no brakes‚Äù opportunity.

A strict 30-day cap is in place, and its September 2nd listing is already confirmed, adding a ticking clock to this rare opportunity. The appeal is obvious. Each of the 15 presale stages increases the token price by 5%, meaning early backers are already looking at massive gains before the token even lists. It‚Äôs clean, aggressive, and engineered for FOMO. Why now? The stars look aligned Bitcoin just closed July at $115,644, its highest monthly close in history. But with its momentum momentarily slowing, the altcoin gates are wide open. That‚Äôs what usually happens when BTC consolidates‚Äîaltcoins flood in to soak up risk appetite, and meme coins lead the charge. Throw in $5.4 billion of fresh capital flowing into ETH ETFs, and the signal couldn‚Äôt be clearer: the market is hungry for rotation.

2025-08-01 08:55:11,49351749,1754038511,Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking Truth Behind Market Crashes,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking Truth Behind Market Crashes The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic and often unpredictable arena, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye. Recently, the digital asset space witnessed a significant event that sent ripples through the trading community: a massive wave of Crypto Futures Liquidation . In a startling display of market volatility, major exchanges saw over $102 million worth of futures contracts liquidated in just one hour, contributing to a staggering $751 million in liquidations over a 24-hour period. These figures are not just numbers; they represent the sudden closure of trading positions, often leading to substantial losses for individual traders and a dramatic shift in market sentiment. Understanding what drives such events is crucial for anyone navigating the complex world of crypto. What is Crypto Futures Liquidation and Why Does It Happen? At its core, Crypto Futures Liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader‚Äôs margin, the collateral held by the exchange to cover potential losses, falls below a required maintenance level. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. The allure of futures often lies in the ability to use leverage, which means borrowing funds to amplify potential returns. While leverage can magnify profits, it equally magnifies losses, making it a double-edged sword. Leverage Amplification: Traders can open positions much larger than their initial capital, using borrowed funds. This increases exposure to price movements. Margin Requirements: Exchanges require a minimum amount of collateral (initial margin) to open a leveraged position. As the market moves against a trader‚Äôs position, their equity in the trade decreases. Maintenance Margin: If the equity falls below a certain threshold, known as the maintenance margin, the exchange issues a margin call, demanding additional funds. If the trader fails to add more capital, the position is automatically liquidated to prevent further losses to the exchange. Sudden Price Swings: Rapid and significant price movements, often triggered by major news, economic data, or large sell-offs, are primary catalysts for mass Crypto Futures Liquidation events. The Shocking Scale: $102 Million in an Hour, $751 Million in 24 Hours The recent figures highlight the extreme volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. A $102 million liquidation in a single hour is a clear indicator of a sharp, unexpected price movement that caught a significant number of leveraged traders off guard. Expanding that to $751 million over 24 hours demonstrates a sustained period of market pressure or multiple large price swings within a day. These numbers primarily represent long positions (bets that prices will go up) being liquidated during a market downturn, or short positions (bets that prices will go down) being liquidated during a sudden upward surge. The majority of liquidations typically occur on long positions during market corrections. To put these figures into perspective, consider the following breakdown of recent liquidations: Recent Crypto Futures Liquidation Data Across Major Exchanges Exchange Amount Liquidated (Past Hour) Amount Liquidated (Past 24 Hours) Primary Direction Binance ~$45M ~$300M Long Bybit ~$28M ~$200M Long OKX ~$15M ~$150M Long Other Exchanges ~$14M ~$101M Mixed The table illustrates how widespread the impact of Crypto Futures Liquidation can be across various platforms, indicating a systemic market movement rather than an isolated incident on a single exchange. The sheer volume underscores the heightened risk associated with high leverage, especially during periods of increased market volatility. Navigating the Volatility: How Can Traders Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks? While the prospect of mass Crypto Futures Liquidation can seem daunting, understanding its mechanics empowers traders to adopt strategies that can protect their capital. Prudent risk management is not just a recommendation; it is an absolute necessity in the leveraged trading environment. Prudent Leverage Usage: The most straightforward way to avoid liquidation is to use lower leverage. While higher leverage promises larger gains, it drastically reduces the margin for error. A small price swing can wipe out an entire position with high leverage. Implementing Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes a position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting potential losses. This is a critical tool for managing risk and preventing a full Crypto Futures Liquidation . Effective Position Sizing: Never allocate an excessively large portion of your capital to a single trade. Diversifying your portfolio and keeping individual position sizes manageable ensures that no single liquidation event can devastate your entire trading account. Monitoring Funding Rates: Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions in perpetual futures contracts. Positive funding rates indicate more long positions, and negative rates indicate more short positions. Extreme funding rates can sometimes signal an impending price correction that could lead to liquidations. Staying Informed: Keeping up with market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis can provide valuable insights into potential price movements, allowing traders to adjust their strategies proactively and avoid unexpected Crypto Futures Liquidation events. Maintaining Sufficient Margin: Always ensure your trading account has sufficient margin to withstand market fluctuations. Consider maintaining a buffer above the minimum maintenance margin. The Broader Market Impact of Mass Crypto Futures Liquidation Beyond individual traders, large-scale Crypto Futures Liquidation events can have significant ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency market. When positions are forcibly closed, exchanges often execute market orders, which can add selling pressure during a downturn or buying pressure during an upturn. This can create a cascading effect, where one liquidation triggers another, exacerbating price movements and leading to even more liquidations. Increased Volatility: The forced buying or selling during liquidations can amplify price swings, leading to periods of extreme volatility. Market Sentiment Shift: Large liquidation events can erode investor confidence, leading to panic selling and a general bearish sentiment. Impact on Spot Markets: While liquidations occur in the derivatives market, the forced selling can sometimes spill over into spot markets, influencing the price of the underlying asset. Liquidity Challenges: In extreme cases, rapid liquidations can strain market liquidity, making it harder for traders to execute orders at desired prices. Case Studies and Examples of Crypto Futures Liquidation To better illustrate the concept of Crypto Futures Liquidation , let‚Äôs consider a hypothetical scenario. Imagine a trader, Alex, opens a Bitcoin (BTC) long position with 50x leverage. Alex buys $10,000 worth of BTC futures with only $200 of their own capital (the initial margin). If BTC drops by just 2% from Alex‚Äôs entry price, Alex‚Äôs $10,000 position would lose $200. Since this $200 represents 100% of Alex‚Äôs initial margin, the position would be automatically liquidated by the exchange to prevent further losses. Alex loses the entire $200 initial capital. Another example could involve a broader market event. Suppose a major regulatory announcement causes a sudden 10% drop in the overall crypto market. Traders who had opened highly leveraged long positions on various altcoins, expecting continued upward momentum, would suddenly find their margin levels plummeting. Exchanges would then automatically close these positions, leading to a cascade of Crypto Futures Liquidation across multiple assets and exchanges, contributing to the kind of multi-million dollar figures we observed recently. These examples highlight the critical importance of understanding not only the potential rewards but also the significant risks associated with leveraged trading. The market does not discriminate; it simply reacts to supply and demand, and liquidations are a mechanical response to insufficient collateral. Conclusion: Mastering the Waves of Crypto Futures Liquidation The recent $102 million hourly liquidation, culminating in $751 million over 24 hours, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rapid movements within the crypto derivatives market. Crypto Futures Liquidation is a mechanical process designed to protect exchanges from bad debt, but it often comes at a significant cost to individual traders who over-leverage or fail to manage their risk effectively. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of amplified losses is equally potent. For traders, the key takeaway is clear: knowledge is power. By understanding the mechanisms of leverage and margin, implementing robust risk management strategies like stop-loss orders and prudent position sizing, and staying informed about market dynamics, you can better navigate the volatile currents of the crypto market. The goal is not to avoid risk entirely, as risk is an inherent part of trading, but rather to manage it intelligently. Only then can you hope to weather the storms of Crypto Futures Liquidation and potentially emerge stronger in this exciting yet challenging financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? Crypto Futures Liquidation is the forced closure of a trader‚Äôs leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below a certain threshold. This occurs to prevent the trader‚Äôs losses from exceeding their available collateral, protecting both the trader and the exchange. Why did $102 million worth of futures get liquidated in an hour? Such a large liquidation volume in a short period typically indicates a rapid and significant price movement against the dominant position (often long positions during a price drop). Traders with high leverage who couldn‚Äôt meet margin calls had their positions automatically closed by exchanges. How can I avoid Crypto Futures Liquidation? To avoid Crypto Futures Liquidation , use lower leverage, always set stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes carefully, maintain sufficient margin in your account, and stay informed about market conditions and potential volatility triggers. Are all liquidations bad for the market? While large-scale liquidations can cause temporary price volatility and negative sentiment, they are a necessary mechanism in leveraged trading to ensure market stability and prevent systemic risk for exchanges. They can also ‚Äòreset‚Äô the market by flushing out over-leveraged positions. What is the difference between initial margin and maintenance margin? Initial margin is the amount of collateral required to open a leveraged position. Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of collateral that must be maintained in your account to keep the position open. If your equity falls below the maintenance margin, you face a margin call or liquidation. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network on social media!

The P2C approach allows users to lend stablecoins like USDC or major tokens like ETH, earning steady returns such as 12% annual percentage yield on mtTokens. Conversely, the P2P model supports riskier assets like memecoins. This flexibility caters to diverse investors, enhancing the platform‚Äôs appeal. Moreover, the integration of Layer-2 technology is reducing gas fees, making transactions faster and more affordable. This efficiency is driving demand positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leading DeFi protocol. Presale Momentum and Security Assurance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently moving through phase 6 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. This phase is selling out rapidly, offering a fleeting opportunity to secure tokens before a 14.3% price hike to $0.04 in phase 7. Investors purchasing now are guaranteed a 71% return at the $0.06 listing price. The project has finalized a CertiK audit, achieving an impressive 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities detected in its smart contracts. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program with CertiK, rewarding discoveries across critical, major, minor, and low severity tiers, reinforcing its commitment to security. Price prediction and Solana comparison Analysts are projecting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $5 by 2026, driven by its capped 4 billion token supply and growing DeFi adoption. The platform‚Äôs stablecoin system, minted only during loans and burned upon repayment, ensures economic stability, boosting token demand. For context, Solana (SOL) in 2020 traded at a low of $0.50 before soaring to $260 by November 2021, delivering a 520x return in 18 months. While Solana benefited from broader market trends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leveraging targeted DeFi utility and Layer-2 scalability. This positions it to outpace competitors, with a potential 142x return from $0.035 to $5, making it a top cryptocurrency to invest in. Community engagement and incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fostering a vibrant community through a $100,000 giveaway , awarding $10,000 in MUTM tokens to each of 10 winners. Participation requires a $50 minimum presale investment and completing specific quests, including submitting a valid wallet address. Additionally, the team has introduced a dashboard showcasing the top 50 token holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. These initiatives are strengthening investor loyalty and driving presale momentum. Furthermore, the project‚Äôs Layer-2 framework is enhancing crypto investment accessibility, reducing costs, and attracting users seeking efficient DeFi solutions, further solidifying Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs market position. Pathway to future growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a distinct niche in the crypto market with its innovative lending model and robust security measures. The presale‚Äôs rapid progress, with only a limited token supply remaining, underscores its appeal as a top cryptocurrency to invest in. The guaranteed 71% return at listing, coupled with a projected $5 valuation by 2026, offers compelling opportunities for early investors.

2025-07-31 22:30:11,49325059,1754001011,Reddit‚Äôs Astounding AI Revenue Surge: A Deep Dive into Advertising and Data Licensing,"BitcoinWorld Reddit‚Äôs Astounding AI Revenue Surge: A Deep Dive into Advertising and Data Licensing In an era where artificial intelligence is reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace, Reddit, the self-proclaimed ‚Äòfront page of the internet,‚Äô has emerged as a prime example of successful AI integration. Its recent second-quarter earnings report painted a picture of impressive financial health, largely attributed to its strategic pivot towards AI. For anyone following the dynamic interplay between technology, finance, and user engagement, Reddit‚Äôs journey offers compelling insights into how a platform can leverage cutting-edge AI to drive significant Reddit AI revenue . How Are AI Advertising Tools Driving Reddit‚Äôs Growth? Reddit‚Äôs financial success in the second quarter was undeniably anchored by its robust advertising business, which accounted for a staggering 93% of its total revenue, bringing in $465 million. This isn‚Äôt just about more ads; it‚Äôs about smarter ads, powered by sophisticated AI. The company has made substantial investments in developing advanced AI advertising tools that empower marketers to reach their target audiences with greater precision and impact. These innovations are transforming how brands interact with Reddit‚Äôs vast user base, turning conversations into conversions. Two key features launched recently highlight this commitment: Reddit Insights: This powerful tool taps into the colossal volume of posts and discussions on the platform. By analyzing billions of data points, Reddit Insights identifies emerging trends and provides real-time, actionable intelligence for campaign strategies. Imagine a brand launching a new product and instantly knowing what topics are trending among their target demographic, allowing them to tailor their ad content for maximum relevance. This data-driven approach ensures advertisers aren‚Äôt just guessing; they‚Äôre operating with informed strategies. Conversation Summary Add-ons: Moving beyond traditional ad formats, these add-ons allow advertisers to seamlessly integrate actual Reddit user discussions directly into their advertisements. This feature offers an authentic glimpse into public opinion about products or brands, fostering trust and credibility. Seeing genuine user sentiment can be incredibly persuasive, providing social proof that resonates deeply with potential customers. These AI-powered enhancements are not merely incremental improvements; they represent a fundamental shift in how advertising is executed on the platform, making campaigns more effective and, consequently, more valuable to advertisers. The Strategic Brilliance of Reddit Data Licensing While advertising remains the primary revenue driver, Reddit‚Äôs ‚Äòother revenue‚Äô category, which primarily includes its burgeoning data licensing business, is quickly gaining traction as a significant long-term income stream. This category saw a remarkable 24% year-over-year jump, climbing to $35 million from $28.1 million in the same period last year. This growth underscores the immense value Reddit‚Äôs vast trove of user-generated content holds for the burgeoning AI industry. The concept of Reddit data licensing involves agreements with major AI providers, granting them access to Reddit‚Äôs extensive and diverse dataset for training their AI models. Imagine the richness of human conversation, opinions, and knowledge contained within Reddit‚Äôs forums ‚Äì a goldmine for AI developers seeking to create more nuanced, intelligent, and human-like AI systems. Reddit has already secured landmark content licensing agreements with industry titans like Google and OpenAI, signaling the strategic importance of its data. These deals, though relatively new, have already begun contributing a steady income stream. The potential for exponential growth in this area is substantial, as the demand for high-quality, real-world data to train advanced AI models continues to skyrocket. Reddit is effectively monetizing the very fabric of its platform ‚Äì its user conversations ‚Äì transforming it into a valuable asset for the global AI ecosystem. How is AI Content Monetization Shaping User Experience? Beyond direct revenue streams, Reddit is also leveraging AI to enhance the core user experience, which in turn supports long-term engagement and indirectly contributes to AI content monetization . A prime example is the Reddit Answers tool, launched in December. This innovative feature offers users answers in a conversational interface, making information retrieval more intuitive and interactive. Its success has been phenomenal, attracting 6 million weekly users, a considerable leap from just 1 million users in the preceding quarter. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman emphasized the platform‚Äôs commitment to integrating this tool ‚Äúmore deeply into the core search experience.‚Äù The vision is clear: to make ‚Äúsearch a central feature across Reddit.‚Äù By making information more accessible and engaging through AI-powered conversational tools, Reddit enhances user satisfaction and stickiness. More engaged users mean more time spent on the platform, more content consumed, and ultimately, more opportunities for advertising and data collection, completing the monetization loop. Unpacking Reddit Earnings Growth : A Holistic AI Strategy The impressive Reddit earnings growth observed in the second quarter is not merely a result of isolated initiatives but a testament to a cohesive, AI-centric strategy. Reddit is not just dabbling in AI; it‚Äôs embedding AI into the very fabric of its operations, from how it serves ads to how it manages its vast data resources and enhances user interaction. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of their strategic pillars: Diversified Revenue Streams: While advertising remains dominant, the significant growth in data licensing demonstrates a successful diversification strategy, reducing reliance on a single income source. Product Innovation: The continuous launch of AI-powered features like Reddit Insights, Conversation Summary Add-ons, and Reddit Answers showcases a commitment to innovation that directly benefits both advertisers and users. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with AI giants like Google and OpenAI validate the value of Reddit‚Äôs data and position the company as a crucial player in the broader AI development landscape. User-Centric AI: By using AI to improve search and content discovery, Reddit ensures that its technological advancements directly enhance the user experience, fostering a more vibrant and engaged community. This integrated approach allows Reddit to not only capture immediate revenue opportunities but also build a sustainable growth trajectory for the future. The synergy between enhanced advertising capabilities, valuable data assets, and improved user engagement creates a powerful flywheel effect, driving continuous expansion. What Can We Learn From Reddit‚Äôs AI-Powered Success? Reddit‚Äôs journey offers valuable lessons for businesses across various sectors, especially those navigating the complexities of digital platforms and the transformative power of AI: Monetize Your Core Assets: Identify what unique data or user interactions your platform generates and explore innovative ways to license or leverage it responsibly. AI as an Enabler, Not Just a Feature: Integrate AI deeply into your core business functions, from marketing to customer service and product development, to unlock new efficiencies and revenue streams. Balance Monetization with User Experience: While revenue is crucial, ensuring that AI enhancements also improve the user experience is vital for long-term engagement and platform health. Strategic Partnerships are Key: Collaborating with industry leaders can validate your assets and accelerate your growth in new markets. Reddit‚Äôs success story serves as a compelling case study for how a legacy platform can reinvent itself and thrive in the age of AI, demonstrating that strategic investments in intelligent technologies yield significant returns. In conclusion, Reddit‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report is more than just a financial update; it‚Äôs a powerful narrative about the successful integration of AI into a mature digital platform. By strategically investing in AI advertising tools , capitalizing on lucrative Reddit data licensing deals, and enhancing user experience through innovative features like Reddit Answers, the company has orchestrated an astounding Reddit AI revenue surge. This holistic approach to AI content monetization and platform growth positions Reddit not just as a survivor in the ever-evolving tech landscape, but as a formidable leader poised for continued expansion and influence. The future of digital platforms, it seems, is undeniably intelligent, and Reddit is leading the charge.

2025-07-31 22:30:00,49325127,1754001000,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 31 July ‚Äì XRP, Cardano, Pi Coin","With original crypto Bitcoin trading just 3.5% down from its recent all-time high (ATH) price of $122,838 just over two weeks ago, hopes are running high for a new bull run to eclipse the famous 2021 gold rush. This prolonged period of optimism has helped drive growth among several prominent altcoins and some of the best meme coins . Over the past year, coins like XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each experienced historic price surges, indicating the possibility of a market-wide rally on the horizon. As momentum builds for a prolonged bull cycle, investors are increasingly eyeing tokens with the potential to exceed their historical price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Global Remittance Crypto Outperforms Bitcoin in Price Performance This Year On July 18, Ripple‚Äôs XRP token set a new record by reaching $3.65, breaking past its former 2018 high of $3.40. Though it has since dipped to around $3.17‚Äîa decrease of 13.2% from its peak‚ÄîXRP remains up 43% over the past month. It appears to be stabilizing in a consolidation phase, but continued investor interest suggests another rally may be in the works. XRP‚Äôs appeal among institutional investors is fueled by its fast transaction settlement, minimal fees, and cross-border utility without requiring intermediaries. Even organizations such as the United Nations have shown interest in the technology. Following a lengthy legal battle, Ripple achieved a key win in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that its retail transactions didn‚Äôt qualify as securities sales. By 2025, with the SEC concluding its case, this legal clarity will have further strengthened investor trust in the asset. This favorable regulatory backdrop has resulted in strong capital inflows, contributing to a staggering 388% annual gain, far outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs 79% increase over the same timeframe. XRP‚Äôs RSI has decreased from an overheated 86 at the start of last week to a more moderate 54, indicating that some traders are taking profits. This shift may lead to additional short-term selling pressure into the weekend, creating an opportunity for strategic accumulation. In the last 24 hours, XRP has added 1.8% going against the trend of the collective crypto market, which dipped 3.6% overnight to $3.97 trillion. While further downside is possible until the RSI nears a neutral 50, strong support appears to be forming around the previous resistance level of $3. A bullish flag pattern that formed from late 2024 to early April points to the potential for another breakout‚Äîpossibly sending XRP to $4 by fall. Cardano (ADA): Will the Eco-Friendly Ethereum Alternative Crypto Reach New Price Highs in 2025? Cardano ($ADA) has gained renewed traction, jumping 39% over the past month. This rise is supported by bullish technical signs and growing institutional interest. Alongside XRP and Solana, ADA was mentioned by President Donald Trump as a candidate for inclusion in a proposed national crypto reserve. Created in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is known for its academically driven development model and sustainable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus‚Äîa concept that influenced Ethereum‚Äôs transition away from energy-intensive mining. Currently capitalizing over $28.4 billion of the market, ADA would need to more than triple in price to surpass Solana and claim the title of Ethereum‚Äôs top challenger. Overnight, ADA has advanced 2%, outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 0.2% gains and displaying a robustness similar to that of XRP Many analysts see a move from the current price of $0.7876 toward $1.50 by mid-year. More optimistic projections forecast a potential return to ADA‚Äôs all-time high of $3.09 from September 2021‚Äîa nearly 300% increase from current levels. Recent price action has revealed a bullish flag pattern, indicating further gains. However, ADA‚Äôs RSI has cooled from a recent peak of 85 to 54, showing signs of steady profit-taking while again mirroring XRP‚Äôs trajectory. Taken altogether, this hints at the potential for a lot more ADA bullishness before the New Year. The next big resistance level is near $1.15, while solid support is holding between $0.85 and $0.90. Pi Network ($PI): Can This Mobile Crypto Mining Leader Reclaim Price Highs Before Summer Ends? Pi Network is shaking up traditional crypto mining with its user-friendly tap-to-mine system, which removes the need for expensive hardware and high electricity consumption. Unlike conventional models, Pi allows users to earn tokens through daily engagement via its mobile app‚Äîdramatically reducing entry barriers for new participants. Since the launch of its mainnet in February 2025, Pi Network has seen explosive adoption. In early May, its native token $PI rocketed 171% in just four days‚Äîfrom $0.58 to $1.57‚Äîshowing surging demand from both retail and institutional buyers. It currently trades at approximately $0.42. With the RSI now at 35 and trending downward, the token appears to be in the midst of a selloff that could further depress its price in the short term. This downturn, however, may present a strategic buying opportunity for those confident in Pi Network‚Äôs long-term potential. A pronounced falling wedge pattern observed between March and April hints at a possible breakout, so if traders are bullish on Pi and keen to take advantage of its relatively discounted price, we could see $PI hit $3 by fall. Thanks to its streamlined interface and purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain, Pi Network is establishing itself as a serious contender in the next phase of global crypto adoption. Snorter ($SNORT): Meme Coin Meets Trading Bot Utility in Undervalued Presale For those seeking early-stage projects with outsized return potential, new token launches often offer the most explosive growth. One standout is Snorter ($SNORT) , a meme-based crypto with real-world trading utility, built on Solana and aiming for multi-chain functionality. Accessible via Telegram, Snorter delivers live market data straight into group chats. With a modest 0.85% trading fee, Snorter positions itself against platforms like BonkBot, Maestro, and Trojan. Features include MEV-resistant swaps, copy trading tools, rug pull detection, and automated limit orders‚Äîproviding a full suite of tools for active traders. Investor excitement has been high, with over $2.6 million raised during its presale. The platform offers staking rewards of up to 162% APY for early adopters. With its token still priced below $0.10 and set to rise in upcoming presale rounds, now may be the ideal time to get in early. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just exploring meme tokens, Snorter seeks to be a powerful and approachable solution for today‚Äôs fast-moving crypto environment.

2025-07-31 22:30:00,49325021,1754001000,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price of XRP, Dogecoin and Solana","Anthropic‚Äôs Claude AI predicts strong growth for several prominent altcoins before the close of 2025, fueled by the narrative of Bitcoin climbing to further new highs and potentially igniting a new bull run. A little over two weeks ago, Bitcoin shattered previous highs, reaching an unprecedented $122,838. Many market observers interpret this surge as a potential catalyst for mainstream financial integration, assuming current bullish momentum holds. This milestone has reignited positive sentiment throughout the crypto sector, with analysts increasingly speculating that the upcoming bull cycle could eclipse the market peaks seen in 2021, potentially propelling altcoins into new territory. Here are the standout assets Claude AI predicts could generate strong returns by the 2025 holiday season. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Predicts XRP‚Äôs Price Will Climb 120% by Late 2025 Claude AI suggests that XRP (XRP) could see its price climb to $7 by the end of the year‚Äîa 121.5% gain from its present value of approximately $3.16. This optimistic outlook follows a strong performance from XRP in recent weeks. On July 18, the asset hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $3.65, breaking its prior 2018 ceiling of $3.40. Although it has since retreated 13.3%, XRP has soared more than 43% over the last month, outpacing both Bitcoin and other major altcoins. The current enthusiasm stems from a combination of clearer regulatory standing, tangible utility, and speculation around the potential launch of a spot ETF tied to XRP‚Äîall of which could drive substantial capital inflows. XRP, designed for rapid, low-fee cross-border transactions, received a boost in global credibility when, in 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed it as a secure medium for international remittances. In 2023, XRP progenitor Ripple achieved a key legal victory when a U.S. federal court concluded that XRP‚Äôs retail sales did not constitute securities transactions. This legal battle formally ended in March 2025 after the SEC dropped its case, eliminating one of the largest overhangs on XRP‚Äôs price potential. A return to ATH level could serve as a launchpad toward Claude‚Äôs projected $5‚Äì$7 target range‚Äîor beyond, should favorable macro and crypto conditions persist. XRP‚Äôs RSI (Relative Strength Index) has cooled from a heated 86 at the start of last week down to 59, suggesting the asset is locking in recent gains as bulls prepare for renewed upward momentum. Over the past year, XRP has surged 387%, far outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 79% gain across the same time frame. Solana ($SOL): Claude AI Predicts 6x Surge Amid ETF Hype Solana ($SOL) has rapidly grown into a leading smart contract platform, rivaling Ethereum in both developer activity and decentralized application volume. With a market valuation north of $97.3 billion, the platform continues to attract institutional and developer capital. Recent investor enthusiasm stems from speculation around a forthcoming Solana spot ETF in the U.S.‚Äîa move similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals that brought major institutional inflows. There‚Äôs also mounting speculation that Solana could be included in a U.S. national crypto reserve, which would further validate its long-term relevance. Technically, SOL has reversed a months-long downtrend. After peaking above $250 in January and hitting lows near $100 in April, the asset has rebounded sharply to trade around $181. A descending wedge formation highlights an imbalance that could result in a sharp uptick by fall. Claude AI projects Solana could reach $1,000 by year-end, substantially outpacing its previous all-time high of $293.31 set earlier this year by more than 3X and giving it 6X potential by the New Year. If current bullish patterns continue through the summer, SOL could test the $320 mark by fall. In stronger-than-expected market conditions, the price could surge well past the $400‚Äì$600 range forecasted by some advanced models. Regulatory developments in the U.S. will likely play a key role in shaping Solana‚Äôs trajectory as one of the most promising blockchain networks of the coming cycle. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Claude AI Suggests a Best Case Scenario of 5X Gains by Year‚Äôs End Launched in 2013 as a joke coin, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since evolved into a major crypto asset with a market cap exceeding $33.4 billion‚Äîfueled by strong community support and growing functional use. Due to its enormous market cap, DOGE often mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements but adds meme culture appeal and liquidity to its performance narrative. Now trading at around $0.2227, Dogecoin has posted a 38% increase in the past month and appears to be stabilizing after this rally. Last week, it was overbought with an RSI of 80, but this has since dropped to 52, pointing to a more neutral condition after recent profit-taking. A 2.4% rally in the last 24 hours leads a broader 0.2% collective uptick for the $77.1 billion meme coin sector correction, suggesting Dogecoin is keeping pace with buzzier altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano. Chart analysis indicates a descending wedge formation between November and April‚Äîa common precursor to an upward breakout. Claude AI estimates DOGE could rise to $0.1 by the end of 2025, marking a nearly 5x return from its current price level. Real-world adoption is increasing: Tesla continues to accept DOGE for select merchandise, and both PayPal and Revolut support DOGE transactions‚Äîunderscoring its role as a functional digital currency. TOKEN6900: Meme Token Sensation Could 1000x From Presale Levels Although Claude AI maintains strong projections for large-cap altcoins, smaller-cap meme tokens continue to captivate retail investors with their high-reward potential. One emerging player is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 token that launched its presale two weeks ago and has already raised nearly $1.5 million‚Äîindicating strong early demand. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed ‚Äî Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 This coin embraces meme culture and ironic branding, with the project describing itself as ‚Äúbuilt on delusion, irony, and the collective hallucination of extremely online traders‚Äù‚Äîrather than traditional fundamentals. Its concept takes cues from SPX6900, a previous meme token that parodied inflated valuations during speculative market cycles. T6900‚Äôs total supply is set at 930,993,091 tokens‚Äîdeliberately one more than SPX6900‚Äôs cap‚Äîreinforcing its comedic and culture-driven ethos. While T6900 isn‚Äôt offering conventional utilities, it does feature staking options, allowing holders to earn passive income while capitalizing on social-driven hype.

This latest alliance between two countries from this emerging market is a perfect example of how collaboration and the exchange of information can be of benefit. Fostering Adoption The Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) has signed an agreement with El Salvador‚Äôs National Commission for Digital Assets (CNAD), through which it will convey its experience and knowledge, aiding Bolivia‚Äôs efforts to create a regulatory framework for digital assets. The memorandum of understanding will facilitate cooperation between the two institutions, promoting the exchange of technical and regulatory expertise, including blockchain intelligence tools, risk analysis, and other relevant areas. It has taken effect immediately and will remain in practice indefinitely, solidifying the inertia of digital assets as a suitable and trustworthy alternative to fiat, especially for families and new entrepreneurs. The arrangement, which was signed by Juan Carlos Reyes Garc√≠a, President of CNAD, and Edwin Rojas Ulo, Acting President of the BCB, marks a significant step forward for Bolivia, which will stand to benefit from El Salvador‚Äôs familiarity with cryptocurrency and the underlying regulation, fostering an ecosystem of adoption and growth. The landlocked country of Bolivia has experienced significant growth in the digital asset space since the issuance of Decree 082/2024 last year. The usage of these assets has skyrocketed from $46.5 million in June 2024 to $294 million¬†in June of this year. The Central Bank of Bolivia concluded its announcement with the following words: ‚ÄúWe reaffirm our commitment to develop policies that modernize the financial system and deepen financial inclusion.‚Äù Leading By Example The CNAD, El Salvador‚Äôs digital asset regulatory body, has emerged as a key player in the country‚Äôs innovation, security, and compliance within the cryptocurrency space. This is further reflected in their impressive rates of acceptance of crypto assets, dating back to 2021, when their Bitcoin Law was passed , shortly followed by the leading cryptocurrency becoming a legal tender. That same year, the Central American country began mining BTC using their abundant volcanoes to power the efforts, along with separately purchasing it as well. At the time of printing, they hold 6,246 Bitcoins, valued at roughly $740.33 million, according to¬†data from BitBo. Further development milestones can be attributed to Bitfinex launching tokenized US Treasury bills and the gargantuan stablecoin issuer Tether relocating its operations in the country. With its pro-innovation approach, the country is now recognized as one of the most advanced in Latin America in terms of regulation and embrace of digital assets.

2025-07-31 22:25:11,49324759,1754000711,Solana ETF: Pivotal Progress as 7 Asset Managers Refine Applications,"BitcoinWorld Solana ETF: Pivotal Progress as 7 Asset Managers Refine Applications The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with exciting news: the potential arrival of a spot Solana ETF . This isn‚Äôt just a whisper; it‚Äôs a tangible step forward, as seven prominent asset managers have officially submitted revised S-1 applications for their proposed spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund products to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development marks a significant milestone, indicating growing institutional interest and a maturing landscape for digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why is a Spot Solana ETF Such a Big Deal? For many in the crypto community and traditional finance alike, the approval of a spot Solana ETF represents more than just another investment product. It signifies a major validation for the Solana blockchain and its native cryptocurrency, SOL. But what exactly makes an ETF so impactful? Accessibility: An ETF simplifies investment in SOL, removing the need for direct crypto ownership, wallets, or complex technical understanding. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within a regulated framework, an SEC-approved ETF offers enhanced investor protection and familiarity, attracting a broader investor base. Liquidity & Price Discovery: Traded on traditional exchanges, ETFs boost liquidity for the underlying asset, potentially leading to more efficient price discovery. Institutional Adoption: The involvement of major asset managers legitimizes digital assets, paving the way for wider mainstream acceptance and investment. The current progress towards a Solana ETF is a testament to the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles. Who Are the Key Players Pushing for a Solana ETF ? The recent submissions to the SEC highlight the commitment of several major financial institutions. According to reports from The Block, the seven asset managers who have filed revised S-1 applications for a spot Solana ETF include: Franklin Templeton: A global investment giant. Bitwise: A leading crypto asset manager. Fidelity: One of the world‚Äôs largest asset managers. Canary Capital: An active participant in digital asset investment. CoinShares: A European leader expanding into the U.S. Grayscale: The world‚Äôs largest digital currency asset manager. VanEck: A global investment manager known for ETF innovation. The involvement of such an influential group underscores growing confidence in Solana‚Äôs potential and the demand for regulated investment products. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth, noted this concerted effort as a ‚Äúvery positive sign,‚Äù demonstrating active communication and refinement with the SEC. Understanding the SEC‚Äôs Role in Approving a Solana ETF The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a crucial gatekeeping role in approving new ETFs, primarily to protect investors. The S-1 application is the initial registration statement, detailing the fund‚Äôs structure, risks, and management. The approval process for a spot Solana ETF is rigorous and iterative: Initial Filing: Asset managers submit their S-1 applications. SEC Review & Feedback: The SEC reviews, provides comments, and filers revise. Public Comment Period: The SEC may gather public input. Decision: The SEC approves, disapproves, or delays. The fact that these seven firms submitted revised S-1 applications is particularly telling. It signifies a constructive dialogue between applicants and the regulator, suggesting active engagement and collaborative refinement. This bodes well for the future of a spot Solana ETF . What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for a Solana ETF ? While recent developments are encouraging, the path to a fully approved spot Solana ETF has hurdles. Understanding these challenges, alongside opportunities, provides a balanced perspective. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: SEC caution regarding crypto ETFs, especially beyond Bitcoin/Ethereum, due to market manipulation, custody, and investor protection concerns. Solana‚Äôs classification (security vs. commodity) could be debated. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are volatile; the ETF must manage risks from sudden SOL price swings. Infrastructure & Custody: Ensuring secure custody solutions for underlying SOL is paramount. Opportunities: Diversification: Offers investors a way to diversify crypto holdings beyond BTC/ETH. Mainstream Exposure: Boosts Solana‚Äôs visibility and legitimacy in traditional finance, attracting new capital. Precedent from BTC/ETH ETFs: Successful Bitcoin and pending Ethereum ETFs provide a template, potentially streamlining Solana‚Äôs approval process. The journey towards a Solana ETF is a complex interplay, but current momentum suggests opportunities may outweigh challenges. What Could Be the Impact of a Solana ETF on the Market? The approval of a spot Solana ETF could significantly impact the broader cryptocurrency market and the Solana ecosystem, similar to how spot Bitcoin ETFs affected BTC. Potential Impacts: Aspect Potential Impact of Solana ETF SOL Price Action Increased buying pressure from institutional inflows, potentially leading to price appreciation. Market Liquidity Enhanced liquidity as SOL becomes more easily traded via traditional finance. Solana Ecosystem More capital could spur development of dApps, DeFi, and NFTs on Solana. Competitive Landscape Could intensify competition among Layer-1 blockchains. Investor Sentiment Boosts positive sentiment towards altcoins and the digital asset space. While market reactions are never guaranteed, a regulated investment vehicle like a Solana ETF is generally positive for the underlying asset. For those interested, monitor SEC announcements, follow reputable analysts, understand Solana‚Äôs fundamentals, and practice risk management. The submission of revised S-1 applications by seven major asset managers for a spot Solana ETF marks a truly significant moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. It underscores a growing dialogue and collaboration between the traditional financial world and the innovative digital asset space. This isn‚Äôt just about a new product; it‚Äôs about increasing accessibility, fostering regulatory clarity, and signaling a broader acceptance of Solana as a legitimate and valuable asset class. While the road to final approval may still have twists and turns, the current momentum is undeniably positive, paving the way for what could be a transformative period for Solana and the wider crypto market. The anticipation is palpable, as the financial world watches closely for the next chapter in the journey of the Solana ETF .

Few companies embody this dynamic landscape quite like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining sector. Recently, the company turned heads with its Q2 financial report, revealing a stunning $219.5 million net income. This impressive rebound from a previous loss has sparked considerable discussion across the digital asset community. But what exactly drove this dramatic shift, especially when the underlying costs of Bitcoin mining are on a significant upward trend? Let‚Äôs delve into the intricate details of Riot‚Äôs performance and explore the broader implications for the future of digital gold. Understanding Riot Platforms‚Äô Remarkable Q2 Performance in Bitcoin Mining Riot Platforms‚Äô Q2 2023 financial results present a compelling narrative of strategic positioning and market dynamics. The reported net income of $219.5 million marks a significant turnaround from the $296.4 million net loss experienced in Q1. This dramatic swing wasn‚Äôt primarily due to a massive increase in operational mining profits but rather a powerful accounting mechanism: an unrealized gain on its substantial Bitcoin holdings. Imagine holding a valuable asset that suddenly appreciates significantly in market value ‚Äì that‚Äôs precisely what happened for Riot with its Bitcoin reserves. Specifically, a staggering $470.8 million unrealized gain on its Bitcoin holdings was the primary catalyst for this financial rebound. It‚Äôs crucial to understand the distinction here: an ‚Äúunrealized gain‚Äù means the company hasn‚Äôt sold the Bitcoin yet. The profit exists on paper, reflecting the increased market value of their assets. While this is a positive indicator of asset appreciation, it doesn‚Äôt represent cash flow from operations directly. This nuance is vital for investors to grasp, as it highlights the company‚Äôs dual role as both a Bitcoin mining operator and a significant holder of the asset itself. Despite this impressive quarterly profit, the year-to-date net loss for Riot Platforms still stands at $76.9 million. This figure provides a more holistic view of their financial journey throughout the year, indicating that while Q2 was strong, the earlier part of the year presented significant challenges. This underlines the inherent volatility and capital-intensive nature of the Bitcoin mining industry, where profitability can fluctuate wildly based on market prices, energy costs, and mining difficulty. The Double-Edged Sword: Rising Bitcoin Mining Costs While the Q2 profit is certainly headline-grabbing, a critical detail often overshadowed is the substantial increase in Bitcoin mining costs. Riot Platforms reported a staggering 93% year-over-year rise in these operational expenses. This isn‚Äôt just a minor blip; it‚Äôs a significant indicator of the increasing pressures faced by miners across the globe. What factors contribute to such a dramatic surge in costs? Several key elements are at play: Energy Prices: Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process. As global energy markets have seen volatility, particularly with rising electricity prices, the operational costs for miners like Riot have directly escalated. Network Difficulty: The Bitcoin network adjusts its mining difficulty approximately every two weeks. As more miners join and more powerful hardware comes online, the difficulty increases. This means miners need to expend more computational power to find a block and earn Bitcoin, effectively increasing the cost per Bitcoin mined. Hardware Upgrades and Maintenance: To remain competitive, miners must constantly invest in the latest, most efficient mining hardware (ASICs). These machines are expensive, and their maintenance and eventual replacement contribute significantly to overall costs. Infrastructure and Personnel: Beyond the direct mining operation, companies like Riot also incur costs for maintaining their large-scale data centers, cooling systems, security, and a growing team of engineers and operational staff. To illustrate the impact, consider a simplified breakdown of typical Bitcoin mining costs: Cost Category Description Impact on Profitability Electricity Primary operational expense for mining rigs and cooling. Directly correlated with energy market prices; higher prices squeeze margins. Hardware Depreciation/Upgrades Cost of acquiring and maintaining ASICs. Significant capital expenditure; efficiency gains are crucial. Hosting/Infrastructure Data center space, cooling, internet, security. Fixed and variable costs; scales with mining capacity. Personnel Salaries for engineers, technicians, management. Essential for large-scale operations. The 93% year-over-year increase in mining costs for Riot Platforms underscores a critical challenge for the industry: how to maintain profitability and scale operations when the core expense is escalating so rapidly. This forces miners to become even more efficient, seek out the cheapest energy sources, and constantly innovate their operations. What Does Riot Platforms‚Äô Impressive Bitcoin Mining Holdings Mean for Its Strategy? Beyond the financial figures, Riot Platforms‚Äô strategy of accumulating and holding mined Bitcoin is a key aspect of its business model. The company reported mining 1,426 BTC in Q2, contributing to a substantial total of 19,273 BTC held as of the reporting period. This strategy positions Riot not just as a miner, but as a significant holder of digital assets, essentially making it a proxy for Bitcoin itself to some extent. Why do miners choose to ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù (hold on for dear life) their mined Bitcoin instead of selling it immediately to cover costs? There are several reasons: Long-Term Bullish Outlook: Many miners, including Riot, have a strong conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value appreciation. By holding their mined coins, they aim to capitalize on future price increases. Balance Sheet Strength: A large reserve of Bitcoin can significantly strengthen a company‚Äôs balance sheet, providing a valuable asset base. Market Timing: Selling mined Bitcoin strategically when prices are high can maximize revenue, though this carries market timing risk. The decision to hold nearly 20,000 BTC means that Riot Platforms‚Äô financial performance will continue to be heavily influenced by Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. A significant rise in Bitcoin‚Äôs value can turn unrealized gains into massive profits, while a sharp decline can lead to substantial paper losses, as seen in their Q1 results. This strategy, while potentially lucrative, adds another layer of market risk to their operational business. Navigating the Volatile World of Bitcoin Mining : Challenges and Opportunities Riot Platforms‚Äô Q2 report is a microcosm of the broader Bitcoin mining industry ‚Äì an industry characterized by high stakes, rapid evolution, and significant external pressures. Beyond the immediate financial figures, several overarching themes define this sector: Energy Consumption and Sustainability: The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining remains a hot topic. As miners scale, their energy footprint grows, leading to calls for more sustainable practices and the use of renewable energy sources. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are increasingly looking at how to regulate the crypto industry, including mining. Potential regulations around energy consumption, emissions, or even the classification of Bitcoin as a security could impact mining operations significantly. Hashrate Wars and Competition: The Bitcoin mining landscape is fiercely competitive. New entrants, technological advancements, and the constant race for more efficient hardware mean that miners must continually innovate to maintain their market share and profitability. Market Cycles: The crypto market operates in distinct bull and bear cycles. Miners thrive during bull markets when Bitcoin prices are high, making operations more profitable. Bear markets, however, can be brutal, pushing less capitalized miners out of business. Despite these challenges, opportunities abound. The continued global adoption of Bitcoin, the increasing efficiency of mining hardware, and the potential for innovative energy solutions (like utilizing flare gas or stranded energy) present pathways for sustained growth. Companies that can strategically manage their energy costs, upgrade their infrastructure efficiently, and adapt to regulatory changes are best positioned for long-term success in this dynamic sector. What Can Investors Learn from Riot Platforms‚Äô Bitcoin Mining Performance? For investors eyeing the Bitcoin mining space, Riot Platforms‚Äô recent report offers several actionable insights: Understand Unrealized Gains: Distinguish between operational profits and gains from asset appreciation. While both contribute to net income, only the former reflects the core mining business‚Äôs direct profitability. Monitor Energy Costs: Energy is the largest variable cost for miners. Keep an eye on global energy prices and a company‚Äôs energy strategy. Assess BTC Holdings Strategy: A company‚Äôs decision to hold or sell mined Bitcoin significantly impacts its balance sheet and exposure to Bitcoin price volatility. Evaluate Efficiency: Look at metrics like hash rate per joule or cost per Bitcoin mined to gauge operational efficiency compared to peers. Consider Market Cycles: Bitcoin mining stocks are highly leveraged plays on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. They can offer amplified gains during bull runs but also amplified losses during downturns. Conclusion: A Resilient Path in Bitcoin Mining Riot Platforms‚Äô Q2 performance is a testament to the complex, yet often rewarding, world of Bitcoin mining . The company‚Äôs impressive rebound, largely driven by the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings, showcases the strategic value of accumulating digital assets. However, the concurrent rise in mining costs highlights the relentless operational pressures and the constant need for efficiency and innovation within the industry. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, companies like Riot Platforms will remain at the forefront, navigating market volatility, technological advancements, and the ever-present challenge of sustainable growth. Their journey offers valuable lessons for anyone seeking to understand the intricate dance between digital assets, energy, and corporate strategy.

2025-07-31 22:10:11,49324228,1753999811,Pivotal Mill City Ventures SUI Acquisition: A Game-Changer for Crypto Finance,"BitcoinWorld Pivotal Mill City Ventures SUI Acquisition: A Game-Changer for Crypto Finance In a move that has sent ripples across both traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, Mill City Ventures (Nasdaq: MCVT), a prominent non-bank lending and special finance company, has announced a monumental investment. This strategic decision, centered around a substantial Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition , signifies a bold step into the digital asset landscape and could reshape perceptions of institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies. It‚Äôs a fascinating development that begs a closer look at what it means for the future of finance. What Does the Mill City Ventures SUI Acquisition Entail? Mill City Ventures recently disclosed that it successfully raised an impressive $450 million through a private placement. But where did these significant funds go? According to a report by The Block, the entirety of this capital was strategically deployed to acquire a staggering 76,271,187 SUI tokens. This massive acquisition was not conducted on a public exchange but rather through an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction directly with the Sui Foundation. This method of acquisition is particularly noteworthy, as it offers unique advantages and insights into the evolving landscape of institutional crypto investments. Sizeable Investment: $450 million represents a substantial commitment, underscoring Mill City Ventures‚Äô serious intent in the digital asset space. Direct Transaction: The OTC nature of the deal with the Sui Foundation bypasses public exchanges, often preferred by institutions for large-volume transactions to minimize market impact. Strategic Asset: SUI, as the native token of the Sui blockchain, is a relatively new but high-potential Layer 1 blockchain, making this a forward-looking investment. Why is SUI an Attractive Asset for Institutional Investors? SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, has quickly garnered attention since its mainnet launch. Developed by Mysten Labs, a team with strong ties to Meta‚Äôs Diem project, Sui is designed for high performance, low latency, and scalability, aiming to power the next generation of Web3 applications. Its object-centric model and parallel execution capabilities make it particularly appealing for gaming, DeFi, and social applications. For an entity like Mill City Ventures, investing in SUI could be driven by several factors: Technological Innovation: Sui‚Äôs unique architecture promises superior throughput and developer experience, positioning it as a strong contender in the Layer 1 race. Growth Potential: As a relatively new blockchain, SUI offers significant upside potential if its ecosystem grows and adoption increases. Diversification: For a non-bank lending company, adding a high-growth digital asset like SUI to its portfolio offers diversification beyond traditional financial instruments. Strategic Alignment: The acquisition could signal Mill City Ventures‚Äô belief in the long-term viability and disruptive potential of blockchain technology in finance. Understanding Over-the-Counter (OTC) Transactions in Crypto The choice of an OTC transaction for the Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition is a key detail. Unlike buying and selling on public exchanges, OTC deals involve direct transactions between two parties, often facilitated by an OTC desk or broker. This method is frequently favored by institutional investors for large trades due to several benefits and considerations: Feature OTC Transactions Exchange Transactions Market Impact Minimal; large orders don‚Äôt directly affect public order books. Significant; large orders can cause price slippage. Pricing Negotiated price, often a fixed rate for the entire volume. Market-driven, subject to real-time fluctuations. Privacy Higher degree of privacy; transaction details not immediately public. Publicly recorded on the blockchain (for crypto) and visible on order books. Liquidity Can facilitate large trades even in illiquid markets. Dependent on available liquidity on the exchange. Counterparty Risk Present; mitigated by reputable OTC desks. Minimal; exchanges act as intermediaries. The OTC route ensures that Mill City Ventures could acquire such a substantial amount of SUI without causing significant price volatility on public exchanges, which would likely have driven up their cost. This method also allows for more customized terms and direct negotiation, which is crucial for deals of this magnitude. What are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? The Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition is more than just a single transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful signal. It underscores a growing trend of traditional financial institutions exploring and embracing digital assets. This move by a Nasdaq-listed company suggests a maturation of the crypto market and increasing institutional confidence. Validation for SUI: Such a large institutional investment provides significant validation for the Sui blockchain and its native token, potentially boosting its credibility and attracting further interest from both retail and institutional investors. Bridging TradFi and Crypto: This acquisition exemplifies the ongoing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As more established players enter the space, it can lead to greater liquidity, stability, and regulatory clarity. Shifting Investment Strategies: Companies like Mill City Ventures are looking beyond traditional asset classes for growth and diversification, recognizing the potential of high-growth blockchain technologies. This could encourage other traditional firms to follow suit. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional participation often brings heightened regulatory attention. While this can be challenging, it can also lead to clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for future investments. Challenges and Considerations for Such Large-Scale Crypto Investments While the Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with inherent challenges and considerations. Investing in cryptocurrencies, even for large institutions, carries risks that differ from traditional asset classes. Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme price volatility. A $450 million investment in SUI is exposed to significant fluctuations, which could impact Mill City Ventures‚Äô financial performance. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite growing clarity, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving across different jurisdictions. Future regulations could impact the value or usability of the acquired SUI. Custody and Security: Managing such a large quantity of digital assets securely requires robust custody solutions and cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks or loss. Integration Challenges: Integrating digital assets into a traditional finance company‚Äôs balance sheet, accounting practices, and risk management frameworks can be complex. Market Perception: While potentially positive, the market‚Äôs reaction to a traditional company holding a significant crypto position can be unpredictable, influencing investor sentiment. Mill City Ventures, as a non-bank lending and special finance company, likely possesses the financial acumen and risk management frameworks to navigate these complexities. However, their experience will undoubtedly serve as a case study for other firms contemplating similar ventures. A New Era of Financial Convergence? The strategic Mill City Ventures SUI acquisition marks a significant milestone in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. It demonstrates a growing appetite among established financial entities to not just observe but actively participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This isn‚Äôt merely about buying tokens; it‚Äôs about acknowledging the fundamental shift that blockchain technology is bringing to finance. As more institutions like Mill City Ventures commit substantial capital to digital assets, we can anticipate a future where crypto assets are increasingly viewed as legitimate, investable instruments within diversified portfolios. This convergence promises to unlock new liquidity, foster innovation, and potentially redefine how value is stored, transferred, and managed globally. The journey is still in its early stages, but moves like this indicate that the path forward is becoming clearer, paving the way for a more interconnected financial world.

2025-07-31 22:05:42,49324227,1753999542,"Figma raises $1.2 billion in its IPO, with shares set to open at $105-$110","Figma Inc. shares are expected to debut in the $105‚Äì$110 range, following the company‚Äôs successful $1.2 billion fundraising effort in one of the most closely watched US IPOs this year. That indication represents a possible uptick of as much as 233% above the $33-per-share offering price. A few days earlier, Figma raised its price range to $30‚Äì32 per share, selling 12.47 million shares itself while investors like Index Ventures, Greylock Partners, and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million more. On Tuesday, the IPO gave Figma a market value of about $16.1 billion, according to an earlier report by Cryptopolitan . Adding employee stock options and RSUs bumps that up to roughly $18.5 billion, and including Dylan Field‚Äôs unvested shares pushes it past $19 billion. As Bloomberg reported , this milestone tops the more than $20 billion valuation Figma had anticipated in its canceled 2023 acquisition by Adobe Inc. Huge demand for Figma‚Äôs IPO, first big software debut since SailPoint The offering received orders exceeding supply by over 40 times, leaving more than half of subscription requests unmet, and marking the first significant software IPO in the US since SailPoint Inc.‚Äôs debut in February. Figma‚Äôs core platform enables designers to build web and mobile application interfaces, and it has since extended its portfolio to support coding workflows and collaborative projects. Figma charges by user tier. In 2023, it added Dev Mode to streamline designer-developer collaboration, and it recently launched Figma Make, an AI tool that turns simple prompts into working prototypes. After going public, Field said, ‚Äúwe have to continue to sprint, to push hard, and we can‚Äôt let the public markets distract us.‚Äù He said the IPO shines a light on design‚Äôs importance and ‚ÄúThis is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.‚Äù Revenue in the first quarter rose 46% versus the same period last year. Observers highlight whether Figma can catch on beyond designers. Sequoia Capital partner and board member Andrew Reed noted that developers, product managers, and marketing professionals have begun adopting the platform. Sequoia‚Äôs initial investment in Figma came in 2019, coinciding with widespread shifts toward browser-based design tools. Figma competes with AI rivals with plans for deeper integration Competing AI-centric design platforms such as Lovable and Bolt have seen rapid adoption this year, prompting Figma to prioritize deeper AI integration. Moreover, Field said that Figma plans to pursue substantial M&A opportunities. He also said, ‚ÄúIt has to be an amazing team, an amazing asset, and it needs to fit our culture.‚Äù The transaction also helped US IPO proceeds beyond $21 billion year-to-date, excluding SPACs, surpassing the roughly $20.2 billion raised in the comparable period of 2024, according to Bloomberg data. Industry analysts attribute part of the strong uptake to the auction-style subscription mechanism, in which investors specify both share quantities and limit prices. Field controls the company with Class B shares, which give him 15 votes each‚Äîenough for 74.1% of the total voting power.

2025-07-31 22:03:39,49325063,1753999419,"Ether Eyes Biggest Monthly Gain Since 2022 as ETFs, Corporate Treasuries Drive Rally","Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain that turned 10 , just had its best July performance in three years. The second largest cryptocurrency climbed more than 50% in July, peaking at $3,940 before easing below $3,800 towards the end of the month. The last time ETH rose this much in a single month was July 2022, rebounding from the depths of the crypto crash marked by high-profile implosions of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius. This time, the rally has a different driver with money pouring in from capital markets. U.S.-listed spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) absorbed $5.4 billion of net inflows through the month, their strongest streak since the products debuted last year, SoSoValue data shows. Corporate balance sheets are also following suit. As part of the digital asset treasury frenzy, public companies have gobbled up $6.2 billion worth of ETH, according to data gathered by CEX.io. Tom Lee's Bitmine and Joseph Lubin's SharpLink are the two most notable players , but the latest entrants, like ETHZilla and Ether Machine , have already raised large sums of capital from institutions to deploy for asset purchases. The price action came hand-in-hand with a positive narrative shift, positioning ETH as a key proxy for the booming stablecoin and tokenization market. With the new U.S. rules for stablecoins under the Genius Act and Ethereum hosting more than half of the $250 billion stablecoin supply, that clarity could cement its role as the backbone of dollar-pegged tokens. Price-wise, ETH is currently facing resistance at $4,000, where multiple attempts to break higher failed last year. The crypto market is also entering a historically quiet phase, which could see the rally cool off in a consolidation phase. Still, ETH might have some ""juice in the tank"" to push as high as $4,700 as part of its current run, well-followed crypto investor Bob Loukas said in an X post .

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase says it‚Äôs adding ResearchCoin ( RSC ), the native asset of a science-based research blockchain co-founded by Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong, to its suite of crypto products. ‚ÄúCoinbase will add support for ResearchCoin on the Base network‚Ä¶ Trading will begin on or after 9AM PT on 31 July 2025, if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our RSC-USD trading pair will launch in phases.‚Äù News of the addition preceded a spike in price for the asset, as RSC went from a low of $0.385 on July 25th to a high of $0.762 on July 31st. ResearchCoin has since stabilized and is trading for $0.741 at time of writing, a 10.7% increase during the last 24 hours. In its official whitepaper , the developers of the project say they created it as a means of improving science research and communication. ‚ÄúResearchCoin has been created to incentivize participation in a highly collaborative and entirely open access platform, ResearchHub. This first of its kind token serves to galvanize a community of academics and nonacademics in support of ResearchHub‚Äôs goal of creating an all-encompassing forum for the communication of academic research. The downstream benefits of the success of such a community are significant: with adoption, silos that currently exist in the world of research are eliminated.

2025-07-31 22:00:40,49323748,1753999240,XRP ETF Approval Incoming? Analyst Eyes September-October Window,"A fresh move by the SEC could clear the path for the first US spot ETFs tracking altcoins like XRP. Traders and investors are watching closely as new rules aim to speed up approvals by late 2025. This change comes just months after in-kind creation and redemption for crypto ETPs won the regulator‚Äôs blessing. Related Reading: Don‚Äôt Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You‚Äôve Made‚ÄîExpert New Listing Standards Open Door According to the recent filing of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, any coin with at least six months of futures trading on a platform such as Coinbase‚Äôs derivatives exchange can qualify for an exchange-traded product. The six-month rule replaces a longer review process that could stretch into 240 days. Instead, exchanges can use a 75-day window once they file a rule change. This shift aims to simplify the path for an XRP ETF and similar products. The SEC‚Äôs ‚ÄúListing Standards‚Äù for crypto ETPs is out via new exchange filing. BOTTOM LINE: Any coin that has futures tracking it for >6mo on Coinbase‚Äôs derivatives exchange would be approved (below is list).

Based on reports from crypto lawyer Bill Morgan, this change lets authorized participants create or redeem ETF shares using actual cryptocurrency rather than cash. The revision slashes settlement costs and lines up crypto products with how gold and other commodity ETPs work. Market makers can now back ETFs with real tokens, cutting out extra steps. XRP ETF Odds Climb Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has put the chance of an XRP ETF approval at 85% for September or October 2025. He notes that once the six-month futures threshold hits for assets like XRP, Dogecoin and Solana, the path becomes much clearer. Prediction markets back his view, showing odds near 86% even after procedural delays. Balchunas and his team have tracked every filing and rule tweak. They say these updated listing standards are the last major barrier. With futures already trading for multiple altcoins, issuers need only get the final green light from the SEC. That could happen by early fall, he suggests. Related Reading: XRP Traders Pull Back $2.4B‚ÄîBrace For Impact Or Buy The Dip? Ripple Lawsuit And Deadlines A key hurdle remains the legal fight between Ripple and the SEC. Based on reports, both sides may drop appeals ahead of an August 15 status report deadline. If that happens, it would remove a major overhang on XRP ETF applications. The SEC has already extended Franklin Templeton‚Äôs review through the end of 2025, but this new filing hints those long waits might wrap up sooner. Legal experts like former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel believe a dismissal of appeals would clear one of the last big obstacles. Then only final SEC sign-off would stand between issuers and live trading.

BDO, a global accounting firm, reviewed the report. BDO confirmed that Tether‚Äôs financial records are accurate and that tangible assets fully back its USDT stablecoin. It also shows that the company is growing steadily and gaining more trust around the world as a reliable digital dollar provider. USDT Demand Soars, Backed by $127B in U.S. Treasuries As revealed by the financial report, Tether issued over $13.4 billion in new USDT during Q2 2025. This brings the total stablecoin in circulation to over $157 billion, a $20 billion increase since the start of the year. The steady rise in demand shows that USDT is seeing constant widespread adoption . In many regions, the stablecoin is seen as a key tool for payments, savings, and financial inclusion. This is especially in areas with limited or no access to traditional banking services. Furthermore, Tether‚Äôs investment in the U.S. Treasuries has grown to over $127 billion, with more than $105 billion held directly. This makes Tether one of the largest holders of U.S. government debt in the world. These strong reserves give users safe and reliable access to U.S. dollar liquidity on digital platforms. Tether Doubles Down on Growth with Bold U.S. Investments Tether maintained solid financial health in Q2 2025, with shareholder capital steady at $5.47 billion. This capital base serves as a safety cushion, helping the company stay strong during market uncertainty. The stablecoin issuer also reported a $4.9 billion profit for the quarter, bringing total H1 earnings to $5.7 billion. This includes $3.1 billion in revenues from daily operations and $2.6 billion investments from gold and Bitcoin (BTC). Instead of holding back profits, Tether increased investments in long-term projects like XXI Capital and Rumble Wallet. Additionally, nearly $4 billion was directed toward U.S.-based infrastructure and innovative projects. Tether Powers Payments in Over 150 Countries As more people around the world look for stable digital assets, Tether remains a top choice. USDT is now used in over 150 countries. In many regions, the digital currency is used for everyday spending and sending money across borders. Tether‚Äôs Q2 2025 report shows that its assets are still greater than its liabilities and that all its reserves are fully backed. The company also holds investments in sectors like entertainment industry , artificial intelligence, agriculture, and clean energy. Notably, these are separate from the reserves that support USDT.

Trading at just $0.035, this next‚Äëgeneration DeFi protocol is capturing attention for its innovative approach to cross‚Äëchain liquidity and yield optimization, sparking speculation that it could surge to $3.50, delivering life‚Äëchanging returns for early holders. With the crypto market bracing for a transformative year, the quiet rise of Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of 2025‚Äôs most talked‚Äëabout stories, even as Solana and other established players hold steady. Solana (SOL) Eyes Moderate Upside as Analysts Preview 2025 Bull Cases Solana is currently trading around $177, consolidating below the year‚Äôs all‚Äëtime highs, after a late‚ÄëJuly dip from higher levels $200+. Analysts are split: some conservative models expect SOL to hold in the $160‚Äì$200 range if support around $160‚Äì$170 holds, while more bullish outlooks see potential for a breakout toward $300‚Äì$380 later in 2025, supported by institutional ETF inflows, protocol upgrades like the Firedancer validator, and overall DeFi activity on the network. That said, short‚Äëterm resistance at $180‚Äì$190 may need to be convincingly cleared to unlock further gains. As traders assess speculative narratives, some are also tracking emerging DeFi names like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale: Phase 6 Offers 71% ROI Mutuum Finance is at $0.035 in presale phase 6 due to an early sell-out for presale phase 5. Phase 6 investors will earn a return on investment of 71.43% upon launch of the token. More than $13.8 million have been raised, and over 14700 early investors have joined the presale. Token price in Presale Phase 7 will increase to $0.04, a 14.23% increase from Phase 6. Mutuum achieves DeFi Security with CertiK-Supported Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently released an Official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK as a security and transparency program. Users will be compensated the equivalent of $50,000 USDT for reporting probable bugs in the project. The aim of the bounty program is to provide an equal coverage to all the classes of vulnerabilities. It has been categorized into four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Announces Massive Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway where contest participants will be rewarded in the form of MUTM tokens, each worth $10,000. The top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded by the project‚Äôs newly launched leaderboard system. Bonus tokens are earned on leveling up. Mutuum Finance: Revolutionizing DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending with a product that offers customers the utmost control over assets. It is an open multi-purpose double-lending platform built through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Access to P2C lending pool is through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the prevailing market sentiment, diminishing lenders‚Äô revenue volatility and economic risk of borrowing. The P2P model removes middlemen, creating space for lending directly, appropriate for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance is accelerating its momentum, raising over $13.8 million from more than 14,700 early investors, with presale demand outpacing expectations. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, the token is set for a 14.23% jump in the next round before launching at $0.06, locking in a 71.43% ROI for early participants.

2025-07-31 21:55:11,49323547,1753998911,Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Weakness Ahead of August Downturn,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Weakness Ahead of August Downturn The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting and evolving. Just when you think you‚Äôve got a handle on its movements, a new report emerges, urging caution. Recently, 10x Research, a prominent name in crypto analytics, issued a significant warning that has caught the attention of investors worldwide: the Bitcoin price might be heading for a period of notable weakness, particularly as we approach the historically challenging month of August. This isn‚Äôt just a speculative guess; it‚Äôs backed by seasonal trends and a closer look at on-chain capital flows, painting a nuanced picture of what could be ahead for the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. Is the Bitcoin Price Headed for a Summer Slump? Markus Thielen, the astute lead analyst at 10x Research, has highlighted a compelling historical pattern concerning the Bitcoin price in August. His research indicates that this particular month has, more often than not, been Bitcoin‚Äôs weakest performer. We‚Äôre talking about significant pullbacks, with most years experiencing losses ranging from 5% to a substantial 20%. This isn‚Äôt just a recent phenomenon; it‚Äôs a recurring theme in Bitcoin‚Äôs volatile history. While the crypto market is known for its unpredictable swings, understanding these seasonal tendencies can provide investors with a valuable edge. What makes August so challenging for the Bitcoin price ? While no single factor is definitive, several theories exist. Historically, August falls within the summer holiday period in many parts of the world, leading to decreased trading activity and potentially lower liquidity. This ‚Äòsummer lull‚Äô can make the market more susceptible to larger price movements on lower volume. Additionally, institutional investors and whales might reduce their activity, contributing to less buying pressure. Thielen‚Äôs analysis reinforces the idea that ignoring these historical patterns could be a costly mistake for those invested in Bitcoin. Unpacking the On-Chain Inflow Puzzle: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Price? Beyond seasonal trends, 10x Research‚Äôs report delves into another critical metric: on-chain capital flows. These flows represent the movement of funds into and out of the Bitcoin network, offering insights into investor sentiment and demand. Alarmingly, the report points to a decline in these inflows. The 30-day rolling average of capital flows has dipped from $62.4 billion to $59.3 billion. This reduction isn‚Äôt just a minor fluctuation; it signals a potential shift in market dynamics, suggesting that the influx of new capital, which typically fuels upward price momentum, is slowing down. CoinDesk reported on these findings, emphasizing that a decline in on-chain inflows often precedes or accompanies a consolidation phase for the Bitcoin price . While Bitcoin has seen impressive total inflows, exceeding $1 trillion, with a significant $206 billion flowing in during 2024 alone, Thielen notes that the price impact has been ""surprisingly muted."" This observation raises a crucial question: if such massive capital is entering the ecosystem, why isn‚Äôt the Bitcoin price reacting with the explosive gains many expect? This disconnect could indicate that existing holders are selling into strength, or that the new capital is being absorbed without creating significant upward pressure, casting shadows of doubt on immediate further upside potential. Navigating Potential Support Levels: Where Could the Bitcoin Price Find Stability? Understanding potential downside risks is crucial for risk management. The 10x Research report doesn‚Äôt just warn of weakness; it also provides specific price targets for potential support levels, offering a roadmap for investors to consider. According to Thielen‚Äôs projections, a breakdown below the $117,000 mark for the Bitcoin price could trigger further declines. Should this level fail to hold, the next significant support is identified around $112,000. For a deeper correction, the report suggests a range between $106,000 and $110,000 as a potential consolidation zone. These levels are not arbitrary; they often correspond to previous areas of significant trading activity, psychological barriers, or technical indicators. Investors and traders typically watch these support zones closely, as they can represent opportunities for accumulation or areas where selling pressure might temporarily abate. Preparing for these scenarios allows market participants to make informed decisions rather than reacting impulsively to market volatility. Historical Resilience: Can Bitcoin Price Defy August‚Äôs Curse? Despite the ominous warnings, there‚Äôs a silver lining that bulls might cling to. Markus Thielen himself acknowledged that August hasn‚Äôt always been a losing month for the Bitcoin price , especially during post-halving bull markets. He specifically pointed to years like 2013, 2017, and 2021, which saw notable gains in August following a Bitcoin halving event. These periods were characterized by strong underlying bullish momentum, often driven by renewed investor interest, technological advancements, or broader market euphoria. The key question then becomes: are current market conditions similar enough to these historically positive post-halving Augusts? While Bitcoin did experience its latest halving in April 2024, the broader economic landscape, regulatory environment, and institutional adoption narrative are constantly evolving. Investors must weigh the current macro factors and on-chain data against these historical precedents. While history doesn‚Äôt repeat itself exactly, it often rhymes. Understanding these nuances is vital for forming a balanced outlook on the future trajectory of the Bitcoin price . Actionable Strategies for Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility Given the mixed signals and potential for heightened volatility, what can investors do to protect their portfolios and potentially capitalize on market movements? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor reports from reputable research firms like 10x Research and news outlets like CoinDesk. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and staying updated on the latest analysis is paramount. Risk Management is Key: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of attempting to time the market, consider a DCA strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Bitcoin price . This approach helps average out your purchase price over time and can mitigate the impact of short-term volatility. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Pay attention to on-chain data beyond just price. Metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and mining difficulty can offer deeper insights into the underlying health and demand for Bitcoin. Prepare for Both Scenarios: While the warning points to weakness, the market is unpredictable. Have a plan for both a downside correction and a potential rebound. Identify your entry and exit points for various scenarios. The current market outlook for the Bitcoin price is undeniably complex. While 10x Research‚Äôs warning about seasonal weakness and declining on-chain inflows presents a cautious near-term view, it‚Äôs essential to remember Bitcoin‚Äôs historical resilience, especially during post-halving periods. The market is a constant interplay of fear and greed, data and sentiment. By staying informed, understanding the underlying dynamics, and employing sound investment strategies, you can navigate these challenging waters with greater confidence. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin succumbs to historical patterns or defies expectations once again. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is 10x Research‚Äôs main concern about the Bitcoin price? 10x Research is primarily concerned about potential Bitcoin price weakness in August, citing historical seasonal downturns and a noticeable decline in on-chain capital inflows as key indicators. Q2: Why is August historically considered a weak month for Bitcoin? Historically, August has shown a pattern of negative returns for Bitcoin, with losses often ranging from 5% to 20%. This could be attributed to factors like reduced trading activity during summer holidays and lower market liquidity. Q3: What do declining on-chain inflows suggest for the Bitcoin price? Declining on-chain inflows, as reported by 10x Research, suggest a slowdown in new capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem. This can indicate a potential consolidation phase or a lack of strong buying pressure, which may lead to muted price action or even downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Q4: What are the key support levels for Bitcoin identified in the report? The report projects a potential breakdown below $117,000, with key support levels identified at $112,000 and a deeper range between $106,000 and $110,000. Q5: Are there any historical precedents for Bitcoin gaining in August despite the general weakness? Yes, Markus Thielen noted that Bitcoin has seen gains in August during post-halving bull markets, specifically in 2013, 2017, and 2021. These instances offer a glimmer of hope for bulls, suggesting that strong underlying market momentum can sometimes override seasonal trends. Q6: How can investors prepare for potential Bitcoin price volatility? Investors can prepare by staying informed, implementing strong risk management strategies like stop-loss orders, considering dollar-cost averaging (DCA), monitoring on-chain metrics, and having a plan for both upward and downward market movements.

2025-07-31 21:45:30,49323331,1753998330,Algorand Foundation releases its roadmap for 2025 and 2026,"Algorand Foundation has released its roadmap for 2025 onwards with plans to launch new infrastructural products in the coming years. The foundation stated that the roadmap is part of its efforts to boost real-world blockchain adoption. According to the press release from the foundation, its new roadmap will focus on four key areas, including simplifying user experience and accelerating innovation to deliver constant upgrades to the network. It noted that part of the innovation will focus on enabling use cases that support stablecoins, tokenizations, and AI agents while improving the network security and privacy standards to be quantum-resistant. Speaking on its plans, Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden noted the new roadmap is all about Algorand building the right infrastructure for the future on-chain economy. She said: ‚ÄúThis roadmap lays the groundwork to onboard a new generation of people and enterprises that need the blockchain-based products of the future, but that don‚Äôt need to know what a blockchain is or how it works under the hood.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Foundation‚Äôs principal engineer, Bruno Martins, noted that the roadmap focuses on developers and builders. According to him, the core goal is to make it easy to deploy and use projects on the Algorand network, and he expects more builders to launch on the protocol. Algorand plans major product releases for 2025 and 2026 Interestingly, Algorand already has a slate of products set for release between Q3 of 2025 and Q4 of 2026. According to the foundation, these products will address its core goals for the next few years. One such product is xGov Governance, an on-chain community governance framework set to launch by Q3 of 2024. The framework is expected to be used for allocations of grants on the network, starting with an xGov council before full implementation in 2026. Beyond that, the foundation plans to improve developers‚Äô experience by launching AlgoKit 4.0 in the first half of 2026. This software development kit (SDK) is expected to enable easy deployment on Algorand with new SDKs for programming languages such as Kotlin, Swift, and Rust, in addition to Python and Typescript, which Algorand already supports. Other planned products include a self-custody wallet, Rocca Wallet, set for full launch in the first half of 2026, and Agentic Security and Identity Framework that will allow AI agents to execute on-chain transactions on Algorand. The foundation added that it will further beef up institutional compatibility by launching Intermezzo, a custodial solution for businesses integrating blockchain technology. With the tool, released in Q3 of 2025, enterprises can use Algorand for treasuries, loyalty programs, and other business models. WorldChess has already adopted it for its on-chain loyalty program. ALGO sinks further Meanwhile, the roadmap release has not had much impact on the Algorand native token ALGO‚Äôs performance. While many people were excited about the roadmap ahead of its release, ALGO is down almost 1% in the last 24 hours and has lost 6% of its value in the past week. Its price decline today coincides with the general market struggles, with Bitcoin falling to $116,500 range after trading as high as above $118,900 earlier in the day. With BTC‚Äôs decline, almost all other major cap assets have also fallen in value, with ETH and SOL down by around 1% each. However, ALGO struggles extend beyond today‚Äôs performance, given that the token, which is trading at $0.25, is down by 33.36% year-to-date. Its poor performance is more pronounced when compared with its peak price of $3.56 back in 2019, showing it is 93% down from its all-time high. The poor performance of ALGO is likely connected to the decline in activity on Algorand. The blockchain network has slowly lost relevance compared to competitors such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Sui, Aptos, or Layer-2 networks. Per Defillama data, it has a total value locked (TVL) of $79.91 million, putting it at 49th on the list of networks with the biggest TVL, showing just how little DeFi activity happens on it. With the new roadmap, investors in ALGO will be hoping to see the Layer-1 network record a resurgence. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-31 21:41:36,49323004,1753998096,Strategy Bets Big: $4.2B STRC Offering Targets Massive Bitcoin Purchase,"Bitcoin heavyweight Strategy has launched a fresh $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity program for its STRC preferred shares, deepening its commitment to an aggressive equity-to-Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The filing , submitted to the SEC and announced late Thursday, follows the company‚Äôs strongest quarterly performance on record and comes amid a sharp expansion of its Bitcoin treasury. Strategy Announces $4.2 Billion STRC At-The-Market Program https://t.co/4wOYjw8B2u ‚Äî Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 31, 2025 The STRC program, designed for Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, provides Strategy with the flexibility to raise capital over time, depending on market conditions. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be channeled into general corporate purposes, including working capital and dividends on previously issued preferred shares. However, consistent with Strategy‚Äôs stated objectives, a major portion is anticipated to be allocated directly to purchasing additional Bitcoin . The move builds on the momentum of four other ATM programs already in operation. Each has allowed Strategy to convert investor capital into digital assets, reinforcing CEO Michael Saylor‚Äôs long-standing belief in Bitcoin as a superior corporate treasury asset. The firm‚Äôs filing indicates its intent to continue leveraging equity markets to support its expanding crypto strategy, which now spans multiple asset classes and preferred share structures. Saylor‚Äôs Strategy: Profits, BTC, and Scalable Capital Programs Amid Soaring Equity Demand Strategy‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report , released just after the STRC announcement, showed a sharp rise in profitability. Net income surged to over $2.3 billion, driven by unrealized gains on Bitcoin holdings during a quarter when the price of BTC soared above $110,000. This represented a nearly 140% increase from Q1, indicating the material impact of the company‚Äôs digital asset position on its bottom line. Source: Strategy Its Bitcoin holdings, which stood at 628,212 BTC as of July 29, are currently valued at roughly $69.4 billion. This includes a recent purchase of 14,620 BTC disclosed earlier this week, acquired using proceeds raised through existing ATM equity programs. SEC filings show that between July 14 and July 20, Strategy raised over $740 million by selling multiple classes of shares, a mix of common and preferred. Strategy‚Äôs momentum is also visible in its capital markets activity, which has generated more than $10.5 billion in gross proceeds in just the last four months. Between April and the end of June, the company secured $6.8 billion through multiple stock issuance programs. An additional $3.7 billion was raised between July 1 and July 29 across both public offerings and ATM facilities. A sizable portion of that capital is already being recycled into Bitcoin. The largest tranche came from Strategy‚Äôs Common Stock ATM Program, which brought in over $6.3 billion during that time frame through the issuance of nearly 16.7 million shares. Even after those sales, $17 billion remains authorized under its May 2025 common equity program. In addition to common equity, Strategy is leveraging preferred shares across several new products. Its STRK ATM program generated over $518 million during the same period, while the STRF ATM program raised approximately $219 million. The company‚Äôs May IPO of STRD stock added $979 million, and its follow-up STRD ATM launch in July has raised $17.9 million so far, with $4.2 billion still available. @MicroStrategy doubles down, acquiring 21,021 #Bitcoin after closing the largest U.S. IPO of 2025 worth $2.52B with its new STRC preferred stock. #Startegy #Bitcoin https://t.co/BNc5V6UfhF ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2025 STRC itself also saw a strong cash infusion even before the ATM program was announced.

2025-07-31 21:40:11,49322894,1753998011,Coinbase Revenue: Unpacking the Surprising Q2 Miss,"BitcoinWorld Coinbase Revenue: Unpacking the Surprising Q2 Miss The world of cryptocurrency is often a rollercoaster, full of exhilarating highs and challenging lows. When a major player like Coinbase, one of the largest and most influential crypto exchanges globally, releases its quarterly earnings, the entire market pays close attention. Recently, the announcement regarding Coinbase Revenue for Q2 came as a bit of a surprise, missing market estimates and sparking discussions across the industry. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what these numbers truly mean for Coinbase and the broader crypto landscape. Understanding the Q2 Coinbase Revenue Snapshot Coinbase‚Äôs Q2 financial report painted a picture that, while showing profitability, didn‚Äôt quite meet the Street‚Äôs expectations. Wu Blockchain, a reputable source for crypto news, was among the first to report the key figures via X, highlighting a significant miss in the anticipated revenue. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the core numbers: Total Revenue: $1.5 billion Market Estimates: Significantly higher than reported Quarter-over-Quarter Decrease: A substantial 26% drop from the previous quarter‚Äôs revenue. While the top-line revenue figure caught attention, it‚Äôs crucial to dissect where this revenue originated and how it compares to the company‚Äôs profitability. Breaking Down the Numbers: Where Did Coinbase Revenue Come From? Coinbase generates its revenue primarily through transaction fees from trading activities and, increasingly, from subscription and services offerings. The Q2 report offered insights into these streams: Category Q2 2023 Performance Significance Total Revenue $1.5 billion Missed market estimates, indicating lower-than-expected trading activity or other revenue streams. Net Income $1.43 billion This figure was significantly bolstered by a non-cash gain related to a specific accounting adjustment, not core operational profitability. Adjusted Net Income $33 million A more accurate reflection of operational profitability, showing a modest positive result after accounting for one-off items. Stablecoin Revenue $330 million A strong performer, indicating the importance of interest income from stablecoin reserves in Coinbase‚Äôs diversified revenue strategy. The stark difference between the reported Net Income and Adjusted Net Income is particularly noteworthy. The $1.43 billion Net Income included a substantial non-cash gain, primarily from an accounting adjustment related to its investment in Circle, the issuer of USDC. This highlights the importance of looking beyond headline figures to understand a company‚Äôs true operational health and the underlying drivers of Coinbase Revenue . What Factors Influenced Coinbase Revenue in Q2? Several macro and micro factors likely contributed to Coinbase‚Äôs Q2 performance falling short of expectations. Understanding these elements is key to grasping the broader market dynamics: Lower Trading Volumes: The crypto market experienced a period of relatively subdued volatility and lower trading volumes throughout Q2 compared to previous quarters. When fewer people are actively trading, an exchange‚Äôs transaction fee revenue naturally declines. This directly impacts the core Coinbase Revenue stream from trading. Regulatory Headwinds: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains uncertain and, at times, challenging. Increased scrutiny from bodies like the SEC can create apprehension among institutional and retail investors, potentially leading to reduced trading activity and a more cautious approach to crypto investments. Competition: The crypto exchange space is increasingly competitive, with new platforms and established financial institutions entering the arena. This competition can put pressure on fees and services, impacting revenue generation. Stablecoin Performance: While overall revenue missed, the $330 million from stablecoin activities was a highlight. This revenue primarily comes from interest earned on the reserves backing stablecoins like USDC. As interest rates have risen, this has become a more significant and reliable source of Coinbase Revenue , helping to offset declines in other areas. Why Does This Matter for the Crypto Market? Coinbase is often seen as a bellwether for the wider cryptocurrency market, especially in the U.S. Its performance can provide valuable insights into retail and institutional investor sentiment, as well as the overall health of the digital asset economy. A miss in Coinbase Revenue , even if accompanied by adjusted profitability, signals that the market might still be navigating a period of consolidation or slower growth after the peaks of previous bull runs. For investors, these results underscore the importance of diversification within crypto portfolios and looking beyond just price action. Understanding the underlying financial health of major infrastructure providers like Coinbase is crucial for long-term strategic planning. The reliance on stablecoin revenue also highlights a shift in how crypto companies are generating income, moving towards more diversified and less volatile streams. Coinbase‚Äôs Strategic Response and Future Outlook Despite the Q2 revenue miss, Coinbase has been actively working to strengthen its position and diversify its business model. Their focus on subscription and services revenue, which includes staking, custody, and stablecoin interest, is a clear strategy to reduce reliance on volatile trading fees. This shift is vital for building a more resilient business that can weather market fluctuations and ensure sustained Coinbase Revenue streams. Furthermore, Coinbase continues to advocate for clear regulatory frameworks, engaging with policymakers to foster an environment conducive to crypto innovation. Their international expansion efforts also aim to tap into new markets with potentially more favorable regulatory climates and higher growth potential. The company‚Äôs ability to achieve an adjusted net income of $33 million, despite the revenue decline, demonstrates a strong focus on cost management and operational efficiency. This financial discipline is crucial for navigating challenging market conditions and positioning the company for future growth when market sentiment improves. As the crypto market evolves, so too must the strategies of its leading players. Coinbase‚Äôs Q2 results serve as a reminder that even established companies face significant challenges, but also that adaptability and strategic diversification are key to long-term success. The focus on recurring revenue streams and responsible financial management will likely define the path forward for Coinbase Revenue and its role in the global crypto economy. Summary: What We Learned About Coinbase Revenue in Q2 Coinbase‚Äôs Q2 2023 financial report revealed a total revenue of $1.5 billion, falling short of market expectations and marking a 26% decrease from the prior quarter. While headline net income was high due to a non-cash accounting gain, the adjusted net income of $33 million provided a more accurate picture of operational profitability. A significant highlight was the $330 million generated from stablecoin revenue, underscoring its growing importance to the company‚Äôs financial health. The miss was primarily attributed to lower trading volumes amid a subdued crypto market and ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Despite these challenges, Coinbase is strategically focusing on diversifying its revenue streams, particularly through subscription and services offerings, and maintaining strong operational efficiency. This proactive approach aims to build a more robust business model, ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of Coinbase Revenue in a dynamic crypto landscape.

2025-07-31 21:35:16,49322637,1753997716,Apple AI: Unleashing Billions in Strategic Investments for Future Innovation,"BitcoinWorld Apple AI: Unleashing Billions in Strategic Investments for Future Innovation In a rapidly evolving digital landscape where artificial intelligence is reshaping industries from finance to entertainment, Apple, a titan of technology, has signaled a profound shift in its strategic focus. This move holds significant implications, not just for the tech sector but also for the broader digital economy, including the realm of cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies, which often rely on advanced computational capabilities and data processing. Apple‚Äôs renewed commitment to Apple AI could set new benchmarks for how AI is integrated into everyday devices, influencing user interaction, data privacy, and potentially, the infrastructure supporting emerging digital assets. Why is Apple Ramping Up AI Investments Now? During its Q3 2025 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook articulated a clear vision, stating, ‚ÄúWe see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.‚Äù This declaration comes amidst a period of robust financial performance, with Apple reporting better-than-expected iPhone sales and record revenue in Q3, which saw its stock climb in after-hours trading. This strong financial standing provides a solid foundation for Apple to commit substantial resources to its AI initiatives, aiming to solidify its position in the competitive AI landscape. For years, Apple has been lauded for its ability to integrate cutting-edge technology seamlessly into user-friendly products. Cook reiterated this core philosophy: ‚ÄúApple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that‚Äôs at the heart of our AI strategy.‚Äù This approach suggests that Apple‚Äôs AI investments will prioritize practical, user-centric applications over mere technological demonstrations, aiming for broad accessibility and genuine utility. Navigating the AI Race : Apple‚Äôs Strategic Approach Apple has faced criticism for seemingly being caught off guard by the rapid acceleration of the AI era. Some observers have pointed to announced AI features that have yet to ship, and even accusations of showcasing an improved AI-powered Siri that was far from ready for launch. However, Apple has consistently defended its measured approach, asserting that rushing to market with incomplete or flawed features would be a mistake. Their philosophy centers on delivering polished, reliable products that work as promised, rather than chasing headlines for being first. This cautious yet determined strategy highlights Apple‚Äôs commitment to quality over speed in the intense AI race . While competitors might prioritize rapid deployment, Apple focuses on deep integration and refinement, ensuring that when their AI features do arrive, they meet the high standards users expect from the brand. This long-term view aims to build enduring trust and superior user experiences, differentiating them in a crowded market. The Power of Apple Intelligence : What‚Äôs Here and What‚Äôs Coming? Despite the criticisms, Apple asserts it has already launched over 20 Apple Intelligence features. These include practical tools designed to enhance daily user experience: Visual Intelligence: Enhancing image recognition and processing capabilities. Cleanup Tools: Streamlining digital content organization and optimization. Writing Tools: Assisting with text generation, summarization, and refinement across various applications. Looking ahead, Apple has exciting plans for future AI integrations: Live Translation: Real-time language translation to break down communication barriers. AI-Powered Workout Buddy: Personalized fitness guidance and tracking. However, some highly anticipated features, such as the more personalized improvements to Siri, have been delayed to 2026. This delay underscores the complexity of integrating advanced AI capabilities while maintaining Apple‚Äôs commitment to quality and user privacy. Exploring Tech Acquisitions : Apple‚Äôs M&A Strategy To accelerate its AI ambitions, Apple has explicitly stated its openness to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Ahead of its earnings call, the company confirmed in an interview that it is actively considering strategic acquisitions to bolster its AI capabilities. Tim Cook revealed that Apple has already acquired seven companies this year, though none were ‚Äúhuge‚Äù in terms of dollar amount. This indicates a strategy of acquiring smaller, specialized firms that can provide niche technologies, talent, or intellectual property crucial for specific aspects of AI innovation . These smaller tech acquisitions allow Apple to integrate cutting-edge advancements without the complexities and public scrutiny often associated with large-scale mergers. This agile approach enables them to quickly absorb new technologies and talent, ensuring their AI development remains at the forefront of the industry. Beyond the Hype: The Future of Apple AI Apple‚Äôs reinforced commitment to AI is not merely about keeping pace; it‚Äôs about redefining the interaction between users and technology. By significantly growing its AI investments and strategically pursuing acquisitions, Apple aims to deliver AI experiences that are not only powerful but also intuitive and seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem. This long-term vision positions Apple to continue shaping how we interact with our devices, potentially influencing the very infrastructure of digital economies, including how data is processed and secured, which could have ripple effects on the development of decentralized applications and blockchain technologies. Apple‚Äôs strategic pivot towards aggressive AI investment and its openness to M&A signal a pivotal moment for the tech giant. By prioritizing thoughtful integration and user accessibility over a rushed release, Apple aims to cement its leadership in the AI-driven future. While the path may involve delays for some features, the ultimate goal is to deliver robust, reliable, and profoundly impactful AI experiences that truly enhance the lives of its users.

In a post on X on Thursday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said, ‚ÄúCoinbase is long bitcoin. Our holding increased by 2,509 BTC in Q2, and we keep buying more."" The news about Coinbase buying bitcoin isn't new, but it is definitely on trend, as many bitcoin treasuries have popped up recently to mimic Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR). However, the crypto exchange's CFO, Alesia Haas, previously made it clear that Coinbase isn't a BTC treasury company but rather a crypto operating company that invests in the sector. Read more: Coinbase Is Buying Bitcoin, Just Don‚Äôt Call It a Treasury Strategy. Separately, Coinbase confirmed to CNBC that it is preparing to offer tokenized versions of U.S. equities ‚Äî digital representations of shares that can be traded on blockchain infrastructure. The products will allow users to buy and sell fractions of stocks around the clock, with faster settlement and lower costs than traditional equity markets. The company‚Äôs chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, announced in June that the company was seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the product. The announcement comes amid a broader push by financial institutions to explore tokenization ‚Äî the process of putting real-world assets on blockchain ‚Äî as a way to improve efficiency and accessibility in capital markets. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and JPMorgan have all made forays into the space in recent months. Coinbase‚Äôs top competitors, Robinhood and Kraken, have both recently launched tokenized stocks outside of the U.S. The exchange also plans to launch prediction markets, which would enable users to bet on future events' outcomes using crypto assets.

2025-07-31 21:30:55,49322452,1753997455,MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Unveiling the Astounding $10 Billion Q2 Profit and Bold Acquisition Plan,"BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Unveiling the Astounding $10 Billion Q2 Profit and Bold Acquisition Plan Imagine a company that, in a single quarter, pulls in a staggering $10 billion in net income, primarily from its strategic bet on a digital asset. This isn‚Äôt a fantasy; it‚Äôs the latest reality for Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. Their audacious commitment to Bitcoin continues to yield remarkable results, positioning them as a unique player in both the corporate and cryptocurrency landscapes. The firm‚Äôs recent Q2 2025 report highlights an astounding period of growth, largely fueled by the surging value of its MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. This isn‚Äôt just about profit; it‚Äôs about a pioneering corporate treasury strategy that is redefining how companies view their balance sheets. The Astounding Success of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings According to a recent report by Wu Blockchain on X, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported an eye-popping $10 billion in net income for Q2 2025. This colossal figure underscores the profound impact that Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciation has had on the company‚Äôs financial health. For a firm primarily known for its business intelligence software, this pivot to becoming a de facto Bitcoin holding company has paid off handsomely, demonstrating an unprecedented level of conviction in the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. This isn‚Äôt just a one-off gain; it‚Äôs the culmination of a deliberate and consistent strategy initiated years ago. Strategy‚Äôs decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset was, at the time, seen by many as highly unconventional, even risky. Yet, under the guidance of its visionary leadership, the company has steadfastly accumulated Bitcoin, transforming its balance sheet and delivering substantial value to shareholders. The Q2 profit is a testament to the long-term potential of a bold MicroStrategy Bitcoin investment strategy. Why is MicroStrategy Investing So Heavily in Bitcoin? The question on many minds remains: why such an unwavering commitment to Bitcoin? Strategy‚Äôs rationale is multifaceted and deeply rooted in a macroeconomic outlook that sees traditional fiat currencies depreciating over time. Here are the core reasons driving their aggressive MicroStrategy Bitcoin accumulation: Inflation Hedge: The company views Bitcoin as a superior store of value, a digital gold that can protect corporate assets from inflationary pressures and currency debasement. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Strategy believes Bitcoin is in its early stages of adoption and will continue to appreciate significantly as it becomes a global reserve asset and a primary means of wealth transfer. Capital Allocation Efficiency: Rather than holding cash that loses purchasing power, the company opts to convert excess capital into a scarce, decentralized asset with perceived long-term growth potential. Pioneering Institutional Adoption: By being the first publicly traded company to make such a significant commitment, Strategy aims to set a precedent and encourage other corporations to consider Bitcoin for their treasury reserves. This strategic foresight has not only propelled their own growth but has also played a crucial role in legitimizing Bitcoin as a serious asset class for institutional investors worldwide. Their transparent and consistent approach to acquiring MicroStrategy Bitcoin has made them a bellwether for corporate crypto adoption. Understanding MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bold $4.2 Billion Raise The firm‚Äôs commitment isn‚Äôt just about holding existing assets; it‚Äôs about active expansion. Strategy has announced plans to raise an additional $4.2 billion through the issuance of STRC perpetual preferred stock. The explicit purpose of this massive capital raise? To buy more Bitcoin. This move signals an incredibly bullish outlook on Bitcoin‚Äôs future price trajectory and reinforces their ‚ÄòBitcoin maximalist‚Äô stance. The scale of their ambition is evident in their recent acquisition spree. In Q2 alone, Strategy significantly expanded its Bitcoin portfolio: Start of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 499,000 BTC End of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 597,000 BTC Total Holdings (Post-Q2 acquisitions mentioned): An astounding 628,800 BTC To put this into perspective, Strategy‚Äôs total holdings of 628,800 BTC represent roughly 3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total circulating supply. This makes them, by far, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, dwarfing even some institutional funds. The planned $4.2 billion raise will only solidify their position as the leading corporate proponent of MicroStrategy Bitcoin adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of MicroStrategy and Bitcoin? Strategy‚Äôs ongoing Bitcoin strategy has profound implications for both the company itself and the broader cryptocurrency market. For Strategy, its stock performance has become increasingly correlated with Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, effectively transforming it into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional equity markets. This unique positioning attracts a specific type of investor looking for a publicly traded vehicle to gain exposure to digital assets. For Bitcoin, Strategy‚Äôs continued accumulation and public advocacy lend significant credibility. Each new purchase, especially one as large as the planned $4.2 billion raise, sends a strong signal to the market about institutional confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value. It highlights a growing trend of corporations exploring digital assets as legitimate components of their financial strategy. This relentless pursuit of MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings contributes to Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity narrative and strengthens its position as a global macro asset. Navigating the Risks and Rewards of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy While the recent profit figures are compelling, it‚Äôs essential to consider both the rewards and potential challenges associated with Strategy‚Äôs high-conviction MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. Potential Rewards: Exponential Growth Potential: If Bitcoin continues its long-term upward trajectory, Strategy‚Äôs holdings could lead to immense shareholder value. Pioneering Market Position: The company has carved out a unique niche, attracting investors specifically interested in Bitcoin exposure through a traditional stock. Inflation Hedging: A strong defense against the erosion of purchasing power for corporate treasury assets. Potential Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: While beneficial during bull runs, significant price drops could lead to substantial unrealized losses, impacting financial reports and investor sentiment. Concentration Risk: A large portion of the company‚Äôs value is tied to a single, volatile asset, increasing overall risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies could introduce unforeseen challenges. Dilution Risk: Issuing new stock, even preferred stock, can dilute existing shareholder value if not managed effectively against the appreciation of the underlying asset. For investors, Strategy‚Äôs journey offers valuable insights into high-conviction investing. It demonstrates the potential rewards of a long-term, patient approach to assets believed to have transformative potential, but also highlights the importance of understanding and accepting significant volatility. Strategy‚Äôs Q2 2025 financial report is more than just numbers; it‚Äôs a powerful affirmation of their pioneering MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. The $10 billion profit, largely attributable to Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, coupled with the ambitious $4.2 billion raise for further acquisitions, solidifies their position as a leading corporate evangelist for digital assets. This bold approach not only generates significant returns but also pushes the boundaries of corporate finance, signaling a new era where Bitcoin plays an increasingly central role in global treasury management. As the firm continues its journey, the world watches to see how this unprecedented bet on Bitcoin will reshape both corporate balance sheets and the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Strategy‚Äôs primary business? Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, is primarily a business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services company. However, in recent years, it has become widely recognized for its corporate treasury strategy centered on accumulating Bitcoin. How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own? As of the end of Q2 2025, and including subsequent acquisitions mentioned, Strategy‚Äôs total MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings reached approximately 628,800 BTC. Why is Strategy raising $4.2 billion? Strategy plans to raise $4.2 billion through the issuance of STRC perpetual preferred stock specifically to acquire more Bitcoin, further increasing its already substantial holdings.

2025-07-31 21:25:11,49322225,1753997111,Coinbase Tokenized Stocks: A Revolutionary Leap into Prediction Markets,"BitcoinWorld Coinbase Tokenized Stocks: A Revolutionary Leap into Prediction Markets Get ready for a significant shift in digital asset trading. Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is set to launch groundbreaking services that will redefine how we interact with financial markets. Imagine trading traditional stocks on the blockchain or participating in decentralized prediction markets ‚Äì this is becoming a reality thanks to Coinbase‚Äôs vision. The introduction of Coinbase tokenized stocks signals a bold new chapter for both the exchange and the broader financial landscape. What Are Coinbase Tokenized Stocks and Prediction Markets? Coinbase‚Äôs Vice President of Product, Max Branzburg, recently unveiled the company‚Äôs plans in a CNBC interview, detailing their intention to offer services like tokenized stocks and prediction markets. But what exactly do these terms mean, and why are they generating such excitement? Understanding Tokenized Stocks A tokenized stock is a digital representation of a traditional company share, issued and traded on a blockchain. It‚Äôs a crypto token whose value is derived from an underlying real-world stock, offering several advantages: Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy small portions of high-value stocks, making blue-chip companies more accessible. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets, tokenized stocks can potentially be traded around the clock, reflecting the always-on nature of cryptocurrency markets. Increased Liquidity: By opening up trading to a global, always-on audience, liquidity could improve significantly. Transparency and Immutability: All transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, offering unparalleled transparency and resistance to manipulation. Lower Fees: Blockchain-based transactions can often bypass traditional intermediaries, potentially leading to reduced trading fees. This innovation could democratize access to traditional equity markets, allowing more individuals to participate in global economic growth through Coinbase tokenized stocks . Exploring Prediction Markets Prediction markets are platforms where users bet on the outcome of future events, from elections to economic indicators. Participants buy and sell shares representing specific outcomes, with prices reflecting the crowd‚Äôs perceived probability. Correct outcome shares pay out when the event concludes. Coinbase‚Äôs foray into prediction markets could bring several benefits: Decentralized Forecasting: Harnessing the ‚Äòwisdom of the crowd‚Äô for more accurate predictions. New Investment Avenues: Offering users unique ways to engage with and profit from their knowledge of various events. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain ensures that all bets and payouts are transparent and auditable. Why Is Coinbase Venturing into Tokenized Stocks and Prediction Markets? Coinbase‚Äôs strategic move into these services is about fulfilling a grander vision. Branzburg stated Coinbase is transforming into a ‚Äúone-stop shop‚Äù for all on-chain trading needs. This ambitious goal is driven by several factors: Meeting Evolving User Demands: As the crypto space matures, users seek more sophisticated and diversified investment opportunities beyond just cryptocurrencies. Bridging Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance (DeFi): By offering tokenized versions of traditional assets, Coinbase directly links the established financial world with the innovative blockchain ecosystem. This could onboard a new wave of users. Strengthening Market Position: In an increasingly competitive crypto landscape, offering unique services like Coinbase tokenized stocks helps solidify its position as a market leader. Long-Term Growth Strategy: Diversifying revenue streams and user engagement beyond volatile cryptocurrency trading. This strategy aims to provide a seamless, integrated experience where users can manage a wide array of digital assets, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to tokenized shares of Apple or Tesla, all within the Coinbase ecosystem. The Roadmap Ahead: US Launch and Global Expansion for Coinbase Tokenized Stocks These new services are set to launch in the coming months for U.S. users. This initial domestic focus allows Coinbase to navigate the complex U.S. regulatory landscape before broader expansion. Navigating the Regulatory Maze ‚ÄúSubject to regulatory approval‚Äù is crucial. Tokenized stocks involve securities laws, which vary globally. Coinbase must work closely with regulators like the SEC in the U.S. for full compliance, potentially involving: Obtaining necessary licenses. Adhering to strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Ensuring robust investor protection frameworks. Once a successful framework is established in the U.S., Coinbase plans to gradually expand internationally. This phased approach is a prudent strategy for managing significant legal and compliance challenges in global financial services. What Are the Benefits and Potential Impacts of Coinbase‚Äôs New Offerings? The launch of Coinbase tokenized stocks and prediction markets could have far-reaching implications for investors, the crypto market, and the financial industry. For Individual Investors: Enhanced Accessibility: Easier access to global equity markets, especially for those in regions with limited traditional brokerage services. Portfolio Diversification: A new avenue for crypto investors to diversify holdings with assets that typically exhibit different risk profiles. Innovation in Engagement: Prediction markets offer a novel way to engage with current events and potentially profit from informed opinions. For the Crypto Market: Increased Mainstream Adoption: By offering familiar assets on a blockchain, Coinbase could attract traditional investors into the crypto ecosystem, bridging TradFi and DeFi. New Use Cases for Blockchain: Showcasing the practical utility of blockchain technology beyond just cryptocurrencies. Greater Liquidity and Efficiency: Bringing more capital and trading activity onto the blockchain. For the Financial Industry: Disruption and Innovation: Pushing traditional financial institutions to innovate and potentially adopt blockchain technologies. Democratization of Finance: Potentially leveling the playing field for investors globally, reducing barriers to entry. Navigating the Challenges: Risks and Regulatory Landscape for Coinbase Tokenized Stocks While exciting, these new ventures come with significant hurdles and risks. Regulatory Uncertainty: This remains the most significant challenge. Regulators worldwide are still grappling with how to classify and regulate digital assets, especially those linked to traditional securities. Coinbase will need to meticulously navigate different legal frameworks, which can be time-consuming and costly. A misstep could lead to significant fines or operational restrictions. Market Volatility and Price Discrepancy: While tokenized stocks are pegged to traditional stock prices, the crypto market itself is highly volatile. This could introduce new layers of volatility or price discrepancies if the underlying crypto asset or stablecoin used for trading experiences significant fluctuations. Maintaining a stable peg will be crucial. Security and Smart Contract Risks: Any blockchain-based system is susceptible to smart contract bugs or hacking attempts. While Coinbase has a strong security track record, the complexity of new products always introduces new vectors for potential exploits. Robust auditing and security measures will be paramount. User Education and Protection: As these are novel financial products, ensuring users fully understand the risks, mechanisms, and regulatory implications will be vital. Coinbase will need to invest heavily in clear communication and educational resources to protect its users. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those eager to explore these offerings, consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official Coinbase announcements regarding launch dates, available assets, and regulatory approvals. Understand the Mechanics: Before diving in, take the time to learn how Coinbase tokenized stocks and prediction markets truly work, including their underlying technology and potential risks. Start Small and Diversify: As with any new investment, consider starting with a small amount you‚Äôre comfortable losing and ensure these new assets fit into a diversified portfolio strategy. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: While tokenized stocks aim to mirror traditional stocks, the crypto infrastructure adds a layer of complexity. Understand your personal risk tolerance before engaging. A Glimpse into the Future of Finance Coinbase‚Äôs ambitious move into tokenized stocks and prediction markets is a profound statement about the future of finance. By aiming to be a ‚Äúone-stop shop‚Äù for on-chain trading, Coinbase is actively shaping the digital landscape. This venture could break down traditional barriers, democratize access to financial instruments, and integrate blockchain into everyday investment strategies. The coming months will be pivotal as Coinbase takes these revolutionary steps, potentially setting a new standard for accessibility and innovation in global finance.

And will whale accumulation be enough to support SHIB‚Äôs next move? The latest Dogecoin (DOGE) price update highlights a major acquisition by Bit Origin, which added more than 40 million DOGE to its balance sheet. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity has jumped, with large buyers picking up nearly $64 million in SHIB following a recent price decline. These developments reflect strong market interest, but many holders are looking beyond short-term gains. Instead of waiting for the next breakout, some users are spending their crypto directly on platforms like Spartans. As a crypto betting platform that accepts DOGE, SHIB, and other major tokens, Spartans offers real-time access to slots, blackjack, and sports betting. There are no banks, no paperwork, and fast wallet-to-wallet payouts. For users who prefer active utility over passive holding, platforms like Spartans provide a practical option. DOGE Sees Renewed Interest as Bit Origin Adds Over 40 Million to Treasury The Dogecoin (DOGE) price update has gained traction following Bit Origin‚Äôs decision to purchase 40.5 million DOGE as part of a $500 million treasury initiative. Unlike a short-term trade, this was a strategic acquisition by a company that began in pork farming and now operates in Bitcoin mining. The announcement pushed DOGE toward the $0.29 resistance level. If momentum holds, analysts see potential for a rise to $0.44. However, failure to sustain this move could see a fallback to around $0.21. What sets this DOGE update apart is the shift from retail-driven speculation to corporate accumulation. For some, this is a sign of long-term interest in DOGE as more than just a meme asset. With Spartans now accepting DOGE for gameplay and enabling rapid payouts, users are exploring new ways to interact with their tokens. Regardless of price trends, DOGE is increasingly being used rather than just held. SHIB Whales Accumulate $64M Following Price Drop Following a 12.5 percent drop, SHIB found support near $0.00001317, which triggered large-scale buying. This Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity included the purchase of 4.66 trillion SHIB, valued at approximately $63.7 million. The move helped stabilize the price and signaled potential interest in a rebound. Analysts are monitoring closely, as whale activity at support zones can often precede trend reversals. Additional indicators include falling exchange reserves for SHIB, which suggests coins are being moved into private wallets rather than prepared for sale. This is generally seen as a bullish development. Still, around 27 percent of SHIB holders are currently in profit, raising the possibility of some opting to sell. Even so, the activity of large buyers shows continued engagement. For users who hold SHIB, being able to use it on platforms like Spartans adds utility and flexibility beyond price movements. Spartans Delivers Wallet-to-Wallet Gaming With Fast Payouts Unlike typical casinos, Spartans is a crypto betting platform built specifically for digital assets like DOGE and SHIB. There are no intermediaries, no bank delays, and no identity verification barriers. Users simply connect their wallets, deposit crypto, and start playing. Spartans processes both deposits and withdrawals directly between wallets, with payouts arriving instantly. This structure is why Spartans is gaining attention. It doesn‚Äôt just include crypto as a payment method, it is designed entirely around it. From gameplay to withdrawals, the platform offers a full crypto-native experience. Whether you are placing sports bets or spinning high-volatility slots, Spartans keeps your funds under your control throughout the process. The platform is also expanding behind the scenes. While there is no dedicated token yet, Spartans is in its presale phase and working to add fiat support, Spanish language features, and more affiliate tools. The goal is to scale without losing the speed and simplicity that sets it apart from traditional platforms. For DOGE and SHIB users, this means more than just holding, it means real-time utility. Wrapping Up Bit Origin‚Äôs move to acquire 40.5 million DOGE and the recent Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity involving $64 million worth of tokens highlight strong buying pressure from larger holders.

According to a new report by Cornerstone Research, the first half of 2025 has already seen 12 AI-related lawsuits and six crypto-related cases, nearly matching the 15 and seven respectively filed across the entirety of last year. Interestingly, while the focus on AI and crypto litigation has intensified, the overall number of securities class-action filings in the U.S. remained relatively flat. A total of 114 cases were filed in the first six months of 2025, compared to 115 in the second half of 2024. The data suggests that while general shareholder disputes have plateaued, targeted legal actions in tech-driven sectors are escalating. Crypto Legal Battles Continue Despite Regulatory Slowdown The rise in crypto class actions comes even as federal regulatory enforcement has eased under President Trump‚Äôs administration . Cornerstone noted that investors are increasingly resorting to civil lawsuits to pursue claims of fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct involving crypto firms. Of the six crypto-related filings so far this year, three were against crypto issuers, one targeted a mining firm, and two involved companies that were crypto-adjacent‚Äîsuch as hardware manufacturers or firms with crypto partnerships. Notably, Burwick Law filed three of these cases, including high-profile suits against Pump.fun and the promoters of the controversial LIBRA memecoin . ‚ÄúCivil actions, especially in crypto, often provide a vital path to accountability when other remedies have yet to catch up,‚Äù said Max Burwick, founder of Burwick Law. The remaining crypto-related lawsuits were led by Pomerantz LLP and Glancy Prongay & Murray, underscoring a growing legal interest from major securities litigation firms in digital asset cases. ‚ÄúAI-Washing‚Äù Fuels Rise in Tech Lawsuits AI litigation is being driven largely by what legal experts are now calling ‚ÄúAI-washing‚Äù‚Äîa practice where companies overstate or mislead investors about their artificial intelligence capabilities. Of the 12 AI-related lawsuits filed in 2025 so far, many cite misleading public disclosures or inflated marketing about AI integration. Stanford Law professor and former SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest noted , ‚ÄúChatGPT explains the increase in AI-related securities litigation as primarily driven by the phenomenon known as ‚ÄòAI washing‚Äô‚Ä¶ I have nothing else to add to this AI explanation of AI litigation.‚Äù The post Crypto and AI Class-Action Lawsuits Surge in 2025, Set to Eclipse 2024 Totals appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Class action lawsuits|Crypto lawsuits,EN,0,lawsuit tied cryptocurrency artificial intelligence ai pace surpass total highlighting growing investor frustration legal scrutiny two dynamic sector market according new report cornerstone research first half already seen lawsuit six case nearly matching seven respectively filed across entirety last year interestingly focus ai crypto litigation intensified overall number security filing remained relatively flat total case filed first six month compared second half data suggests general shareholder dispute plateaued targeted legal action sector escalating crypto legal battle continue despite regulatory slowdown rise crypto class action come even federal regulatory enforcement eased president trump administration cornerstone noted investor increasingly resorting civil lawsuit pursue claim fraud misrepresentation misconduct involving crypto firm six filing far year three crypto issuer one targeted mining firm two involved company hardware manufacturer firm crypto partnership notably burwick law filed three case including suit promoter controversial libra memecoin civil action especially crypto often provide vital path accountability remedy yet catch said max burwick founder burwick law remaining lawsuit led pomerantz llp glancy prongay murray underscoring growing legal interest major security litigation firm digital asset case fuel rise tech lawsuit ai litigation driven largely legal expert calling practice company overstate mislead investor artificial intelligence capability lawsuit filed far many cite misleading public disclosure inflated marketing ai integration stanford law professor former sec commissioner joseph grundfest noted chatgpt explains increase security litigation primarily driven phenomenon known ai washing nothing else add ai explanation ai post crypto ai lawsuit surge set eclipse total appeared first,0.139,0.704,0.157,0.5106,1
2025-07-31 11:15:00,49298393,1753960500,Bitcoin Shakes Off Powell Jitters: Crypto Daybook Americas,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The crypto market quickly recovered from the late Wednesday swoon triggered by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments. Bitcoin (BTC) bounced to $118,500 from $116,000, with ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and other major altcoins following suit. The CoinDesk 80 Index traded over 2.5% higher on the day, outperforming the CoinDesk 20 Index , which suggests a stronger recovery in smaller tokens such as toncoin (TON) and memecoins including shiba inu (SHIB). Still, the market overall stayed within recent price ranges, searching for catalysts to break through resistance. Referring to bitcoin, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at FxPro, said: ""The market still needs drivers to storm $120K. The U.S. White House report on the development of digital assets did not contain any details that could inspire new buyers, making the crypto market follow the trends of macroeconomics and traditional finance."" The report, for example did not mention a strategic bitcoin reserve which, according to C.J. Burnett, chief revenue officer at Compass Mining, creates unnecessary uncertainty at a time when clarity is needed. ""Silence on this front risks ceding influence to more aggressive actors abroad,"" he said. In other news, analysts at Glassnode noted that bitcoin is displaying euphoria similar to that observed at previous all-time highs, citing standard deviation studies based on a metric called unrealized profit as a percentage of market cap. A similar study showed potential for an ether rally to $4,900. The number of ether locked in the DeFi protocol Ethena has risen 27% to 2.23 million ETH, taking the dollar value of the assets locked to a record $8.6 billion, according data source DeFiLlama. Invesco and Galaxy Digital filed a proposal with the SEC for the creation of a spot solana exchange-traded fund. Early this week, the regulator approved in-kind redemptions for all BTC and ETH ETFs, unlocking major market efficiencies. Solana-based decentralized exchange Jupiter unveiled Verify4 , an upgrade that streamlines the token verification process with faster approvals and clearer guidelines, now including organic scores, social validation, and liquidity, along with an optional express 24-hour review for a 1,000 JUP burn. In traditional markets, the dollar continued to strengthen with the Dollar Index nearing 100 for the first time since May 29. Copper registered its biggest single-day drop on record after President Donald Trump announced that a 50% tariff would not apply to refined metal but only to semi-finished metal product imports.

The token slumped 60% over the following two weeks as the introduction was greeted with a wave of sales requests. Now, however, the highly anticipated project is showing signs of life. The price has risen 27% in the past 24 hours as buying interest increases. Popular trader Matter posted a PUMP long position on Telegram, adding that ""$PUMP strength is obvious relative to the market."" Part of Thursday's move to the upside can be attributed to Pump's decision to conduct a buyback program , which involves using 100% of daily fees to purchase PUMP tokens on the open market. The token is also publicly backed by a number of traders including Machi Big Brother , who maintained a $13.3 million position despite nursing $4.47 million in unrealized losses. Derivatives Positioning ENA, LINK and XRP have seen the most growth in futures open interest among major coins in the past 24 hours. BTC and ETH global open interest in coin terms remains elevated near record highs However, the negative 24-hour open interest-adjusted cumulative volume delta for both coins and other major tokens points to net selling pressure in the market, raising a question about the sustainability of the recovery from the late Wednesday decline. On Deribit, ETH call bias weakened across the board while BTC risk reversals continued to show a bias for puts at the front end.

2025-07-31 11:14:20,49296362,1753960460,Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Inflows 29 of 33 Days ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why That Matters,"The broader crypto market appears to be in a consolidation phase, with Bitcoin trading rangebound near $116,000-$119,000. Volatility appears to be muted as investors digest recent gains and await new catalysts. New data suggests that the continued ETF inflows are a confirmation of continued bullish sentiment. $55B and Counting Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows on 29 of the past 33 trading days, amidst strong market confidence. These inflows, with a cumulative total of more than $55 billion, confirm the continued upward momentum in cryptocurrency markets, according to the latest update shared by Santiment. On July 30 alone, total net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $47.03 million, continuing a five-day positive streak. Interestingly, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led the day with $34.47 million, followed by Bitwise‚Äôs BITB at $12.66 million. None of the other spot ETFs registered any movement, as per data compiled by SoSoValue. QCP Capital also echoed a similar sentiment. In its analysis, the firm noted that institutional inflows and favorable regulatory developments strengthen the case for potential new highs in the medium term, even as Bitcoin remains tightly rangebound and is ‚Äústruggling to convincingly‚Äù break above the $120K level. In addition to that, accumulation by firms like Strategy actively raising capital to buy Bitcoin, ‚Äúunderscores long-term conviction in the asset.‚Äù ETH ETF Streak Grows Too Turning to Ethereum, spot ETFs recorded $5.79 million in net inflows on July 30, extending their streak to 19 consecutive trading days. Notably, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA and Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE contributed $20.29 million and $7.77 million in inflows, respectively. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH, on the other hand, recorded more than $22 million in outflows. Amid this rising institutional interest in Ethereum, corporate players are beginning to take more direct exposure to the asset. For instance, SharpLink Gaming expanded its ETH accumulation strategy. Earlier this week, the company announced that it had acquired 77,210 additional ETH last week, worth nearly $290 million at an average purchase price of $3,756. As a result, SharpLink‚Äôs total ether holdings have reached 438,190 ETH, with a market value of around $1.69 billion. The firm also raised $279 million in net proceeds during the week of July 21 through its ATM equity facility. Since initiating its ETH treasury plan on June 2, it has actively ramped up purchases while earning 722 ETH from staking activities. BitMine Immersion Technologies still holds the top spot among corporate ETH treasuries. On the same day, it reported owning 625,000 ETH, which is approximately $2.35 billion. BitMine also announced a $1 billion open-ended share buyback plan.

2025-07-31 11:10:34,49296430,1753960234,Trump's digital assets chief Bo Hines confirms White House plans for Bitcoin reserve,"The White House is still on course to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, according to Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President‚Äôs Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. Hines confirmed that the reserve is not only being considered but is already in place despite only being briefly mentioned in Wednesday‚Äôs federal crypto strategy document. In an interview on Crypto in America recorded yesterday at the White House, Hines said the US government‚Äôs intention with Bitcoin is accumulation, before confirming that a strategic Bitcoin reserve already exists. ‚ÄúWell, we have it. It‚Äôs been established by the executive order in the SPR. We also have the strategic national digital assets stockpile,‚Äù he answered, ‚ÄúBitcoin is in a class of its own and everyone recognizes that.‚Äù The comments came hours after the President‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released its latest policy recommendations on the US leading the world in digital financial technology. Hines: We want as much Bitcoin as we can possibly get Asked about the scale of the reserve and how much Bitcoin the government currently holds, Hines did not provide any specifics. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt discuss that right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are several reasons we‚Äôre not disclosing that right now, there might be a time when we do, but I will say we want as much as we can possibly get, and we‚Äôre going to continue to work on that.‚Äù Blockchain analytics firm Nansen‚Äôs data shows the US government may hold as much as 198,000 BTC, valued at roughly $2.35 billion at current prices. The firm reportedly based its data on wallet tracking and seizures linked to federal operations, but the US government has not disclosed any official figure yet. Hines did not elaborate on the mechanics of the reserve, nor how Bitcoin is being acquired or stored. However, he told Crypto in America that ‚Äúthere are countless ways we can accumulate.‚Äù Bitcoin first, but not the only focus Hines clarified that the administration wants to ‚Äúgive credence‚Äù to broader innovation across other blockchain ecosystems. He did not mention specific projects or digital assets by name but said that recognizing the contributions of the crypto industry is part of the administration‚Äôs approach. Bo Hines Speaking in the Crypto in America Interview. Source: YouTube/CryptoInAmerica ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre enormous fans of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin community. We want to deliver for them as well, and I‚Äôm certain that we will. The US is the best place to do business. And it finally is for crypto as of today. And I think that, you know, the industry is going to be just overwhelmingly pleased with what they see come out of this today.‚Äù Alongside the strategic Bitcoin reserve plans, the administration is seemingly planning to update financial regulations to align with decentralized technology. When asked about potential reforms to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Hines mentioned the recent actions of the Treasury Department‚Äôs sanctions policy on crypto mixer Tornado Cash . Hines thanks President Trump for understanding crypto When asked about President Donald Trump‚Äôs silence on crypto policy, Hines said the public shouldn‚Äôt mistake it for disinterest. ‚ÄúI just think that he‚Äôs excited about it,‚Äù Hines explained. ‚ÄúHe understands it better than most. I think people would be shocked by how well he gets it and how much he recognizes how important this space is.‚Äù Though the Oval Office has not been particularly vocal about crypto since he signed the executive order for a national stockpile, Hines believes President Trump‚Äôs familiarity with digital assets has informed the administration‚Äôs behind-the-scenes direction and made the policymaking process smoother. ‚ÄúThat makes our lives a lot easier,‚Äù he concluded.

2025-07-31 11:08:43,49296143,1753960123,"XRP Explodes in July: Surges, Whale Moves, and Historic Milestones Ignite Market Buzz","Ripple‚Äôs XRP has become July‚Äôs hottest digital asset as explosive price action, massive whale transfers, and major regulatory and ecosystem news elevate the coin to the top of crypto discovery feeds. Here‚Äôs why XRP is grabbing unprecedented investor attention and what could come next. XRP Rockets Past $3 Amid Bullish Frenzy XRP broke above the critical $3 level this month, riding a wave of bullish sentiment and new capital inflows. On July 18, XRP surged nearly 20% in a single day, peaking at around $3.64‚Äîits highest price since early 2018. At midweek, it‚Äôs stabilizing near $3.10‚Äì$3.55 and is set to close out its sixth consecutive ‚Äúgreen‚Äù July, according to on-chain data. Historic Whale Movement Triggers Volatility Market euphoria was interrupted by a massive $175M XRP transfer by Ripple co‚Äëfounder Chris Larsen. With $140M landing on exchanges, this sparked a sell-off, pushing XRP down as much as 13.5% and threatening a break below the psychologically crucial $3 threshold. Over 93% of XRP holders are in profit, triggering waves of profit-taking that amplify the price swings. Analyst Forecasts: Is $10‚Äì$15 on the Horizon? Top analysts see the July price breakout as a launchpad for another big rally. Some projections target $7‚Äì11 if XRP can close July above $3.¬†Chart analyst Ali Martinez points to a ‚Äúsymmetrical triangle‚Äù breakout pattern, estimating a potential surge to $15‚Äîover 400% upside. Meanwhile, AI-driven models, including Grok, forecast steady support between $2.70 and $4.00 with potential average trading around $3.50. Most observers agree: if momentum sustains, XRP could retest or surpass its all-time highs in the coming months. Real-World Progress: Bank License, ETF, and Institutional Inflows Ripple‚Äôs ambitions go far beyond price: CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed an application for a national bank charter for its USD stablecoin, RLUSD, a move set to enhance institutional adoption.¬†XRP whales are accumulating at record levels, while major funds like Grayscale have added XRP to flagship products‚Äîfurther legitimizing its role in the market. Industry speculation is mounting that XRP could soon be included in new U.S.-based ETFs, creating another catalyst for big moves in H2 2025. Technical analysts highlight $2.95‚Äì$3.00 as immediate support, with $3.60‚Äì$4.50 as major resistance. A decisive monthly close above $3.03 could open the path for a new parabolic run‚Äîwhile a break below $3 could trigger sharper corrections. Why Is XRP Booming Now? Macro and Crypto Catalysts Regulatory clarity: Ongoing legal wins and bank charter moves boost confidence. Market cycle: Bitcoin‚Äôs record run and broad altcoin rally set a positive environment. Profit-taking: With most XRP holders in profit, volatility spikes on major news events. ETF momentum: Incoming products could supercharge demand. Why Investors Should Keep a Close Eye on XRP As the crypto market experiences renewed volatility, XRP stands out for its unique combination of strong fundamentals and technical momentum. With increasing institutional interest, Ripple‚Äôs efforts to secure a U.S. bank charter signal potential mainstream adoption unlike many other altcoins. Legal clarity following recent court developments has bolstered investor confidence, reducing regulatory uncertainty around XRP. Moreover, growing anticipation around XRP‚Äôs inclusion in upcoming ETFs makes this token a prime candidate for sustained growth in the second half of 2025.

2025-07-31 11:08:22,49296121,1753960102,Memecoins Are Back: Pengu Flashes Buy Signal as Maxi Doge Raises $100K in Presale,"Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) is making a comeback after a sharp decline, showing several signs that the meme coin trend might be shifting. As $PENGU gains momentum, new players in the crypto market, like Maxi Doge ($MAXI), are showing interest. The standout? A fresh TD ‚Äú9‚Äù buy signal right at a key demand zone ‚Äì a setup traders often watch for early reversals. Add in a bullish RSI divergence , a surge in on-chain activity, and the fact that $PENGU has now flipped $BONK to reclaim its spot as one of the top Solana meme coins , and the stage is set for what could be a serious bounce. After all, when the leading meme coins wake up, the whole sector ‚Äì including fresh crypto presales ‚Äì tends to run. Why Analysts are Bullish on $PENGU The TD Sequential ‚Äú9‚Äù buy signal flashing on $PENGU is a classic sign of trend exhaustion, often preceding sharp reversals. Its appearance at the $0.036 demand zone (a key trendline support) adds conviction, suggesting that sellers may run out of steam. Momentum indicators are reinforcing the case. The RSI shows a clear bullish divergence, hinting at waning selling pressure and the potential for an upside shift. On-chain metrics strengthen this outlook: $PENGU has 563K+ holders , recently flipped $DOGE in trading volume on some exchanges, and daily active addresses have climbed to 20K. These figures highlight growing participation and point to it being among the best meme coins . That‚Äôs regaining strength, not fading away. Next Price Targets and Technical Outlook Analyst Lennaert Snyder believes $PENGU is primed for a breakout above $0.043 , with a potential rally toward $0.073 if momentum holds ‚Äì a view supported by the latest chart structure. This projection hinges on $PENGU maintaining its critical $0.036 support, which has repeatedly acted as a springboard for recoveries. In the near term, $0.041 is the first key resistance, followed by $0.045, where stronger selling pressure may emerge. A decisive move through these levels would confirm a broader trend reversal and open the door to Snyder‚Äôs target zone. Conversely, losing $0.036 could invalidate the bullish setup. However, the confluence of strong support, improving indicators, and rising participation suggests $PENGU‚Äôs next move may be higher. Meme Season Ignites Meme coin season is heating up again, and $PENGU is leading the charge. Now the top meme coin on Solana with a $2.4B market cap and trading at $0.0383, its recovery reignites interest across the sector. Historically, smaller-cap meme plays tend to follow suit when a leader like $PENGU flashes bullish signals. This rotation effect is already drawing attention to new presales, with Maxi Doge ($MAXI) emerging as one of the most-watched contenders in the current meme coin pipeline. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Coin With High-Octane Hype Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a full-blown spectacle, and it‚Äôs already moving fast. Having pulled in over $100K within days of launch, the project has tapped into high-octane hype that only the most unhinged corners of crypto can deliver. This isn‚Äôt your typical ‚Äúcute dog‚Äù narrative. $MAXI comes with a 1,000x leverage mindset, a protein shake-fueled community, and a mission statement that reads more like a locker-room pep talk than a whitepaper. Its satirical edge is what‚Äôs making it stick. This project leans hard into the absurdity ‚Äì backed by early staking rewards of a staggering 1,860%- from memes of Maxi Doge bench-pressing Dogecoin to Red Bull-fueled trading marathons. And that‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs catching fire. Traders aren‚Äôt just buying a token; they‚Äôre buying into a movement gunning to out-muscle Dogecoin‚Äôs legacy and flex its way onto the meme coin leaderboard. If $PENGU is the comeback kid, $MAXI is the gym rat kicking down the door. Final Thoughts: Penguins March, Doges Flex Pudgy Penguins‚Äô fresh TD ‚Äú9‚Äù signal, bullish RSI divergence, and on-chain momentum make it the meme coin to watch as it claims the Solana crown. But the real kicker is how this resurgence often sparks broader meme coin rotations, and Maxi Doge‚Äôs satirical, high-energy presale is already capitalizing on that wave. With $PENGU at $0.03830 and $MAXI offering 1,860% early staking rewards, this could be one of those rare windows where the meme coin market flips from quiet to chaotic in a hurry. If you‚Äôre hunting early plays, it might be time to keep one eye on the charts and the other on presales. Just remember: in meme coin land, the only constant is volatility. This is not financial advice. Meme coins are highly speculative and can be extremely volatile.

2025-07-31 11:03:57,49297792,1753959837,"With institutional backing, SOL could hit $350, but is RTX the real star of 2025?","Solana‚Äôs recent run of big‚Äëticket credit lines and treasury moves has traders buzzing, but another token is stealing the spotlight. Solana just secured a $500‚ÄØmillion credit facility to deepen institutional SOL exposure, and price momentum has sent SOL above key support levels. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) has surged 484‚ÄØ%, fueled by a $250,000 community giveaway and real‚Äëworld payment rails that have already processed millions in transfers. Here‚Äôs how Solana‚Äôs institutional story compares with Remittix‚Äôs utility‚Äëfirst breakthrough. Solana‚Äôs institutional wind at the sails Solana recently locked in a $500‚ÄØmillion credit facility through Upexi Inc., a treasury‚Äëfocused firm tapping that line to buy more SOL and bolster its long‚Äëterm holdings. That move underscores growing confidence from corporate treasuries, not just in Solana as a speculative play but as a strategic reserve asset. Onchain data shows Upexi‚Äôs facility is part of a broader trend: institutional SOL accumulation has been steady since early 2025, with each tranche adding to Solana‚Äôs support foundation. Beyond credit lines, Solana‚Äôs market cap is close to the $100‚ÄØbillion threshold for the first time since January, driven by renewed staking yields and growing DeFi activity on its network. That robust backdrop makes Solana a favored bet for funds seeking high‚Äëthroughput blockchain exposure without sacrificing performance. Remittix rockets with real‚Äëworld power Amid Solana‚Äôs institutional buzz, Remittix is quietly redefining what an altcoin can deliver. RTX has surged 484‚ÄØ% surge since June, backed by on‚Äëchain transfers exceeding $28‚ÄØmillion across Africa and a $250‚ÄØ000 giveaway that‚Äôs drawn thousands to its wallet beta. This payoff engine isn‚Äôt built on speculation alone. Here‚Äôs why Remittix stands out: Utility‚Äëfirst token powering real transaction volume Built for adoption, not speculation Project momentum is accelerating ahead of beta Global payout rails are already integrated and expanding Time‚Äësensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth These features position Remittix to take over the altcoin space, marrying rapid growth with tangible payment solutions and setting a new standard for what crypto can achieve. Which path offers the better ride? Solana‚Äôs institutional backing and $500‚ÄØmillion credit line signal deepening confidence from high‚Äënet‚Äëworth players, and SOL‚Äôs price action reflects that. Traders seeking exposure to a battle‚Äëtested smart‚Äëcontract network with strong capital support may favor SOL. Remittix, on the other hand, delivers a narrative of practical adoption: low‚Äëcost cross‚Äëborder transfers, audited security, and a massive community giveaway fueling organic growth. Its 484‚ÄØ% surge speaks to demand for real‚Äëworld solutions, not just financial speculation. Choosing between Solana and Remittix comes down to appetite for institutional momentum versus hands‚Äëon utility. If you value proven infrastructure and deep pools of capital, Solana is a top contender. If you want a token underpinned by real payment rails and explosive grassroots growth, Remittix could be your rising star of 2025.

2025-07-31 11:00:09,49295784,1753959609,XRP Army Rejoices Over This Bullish Portion in White¬†House¬†Report,"The XRP community is celebrating what many consider a defining moment. A new White House report on stablecoins and payment systems has made ‚Äúcross-border payment innovation‚Äù a top strategic priority, placing Ripple and XRP squarely in the spotlight. With Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure already aligned with these goals, this development is seen as extremely bullish for XRP‚Äôs long-term outlook. Cross-Border Innovation as a National Priority The White House report, supported by multiple federal agencies, including the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve (FRB), the FDIC, the OCC, and the NCUA, outlines clear steps to modernize the financial system and enhance the global competitiveness of the U.S. dollar. The first recommendation in the document is the promotion of innovative cross-border payments, an area Ripple has been pioneering for over a decade. The U.S. just told you what it needs and it‚Äôs not Bitcoin The White House crypto report is out. ‚ÄúCross-border payment innovation‚Äù is priority #1. Ripple is the leading U.S.-based company building that future. XRP powers it. RLUSD connects it. ODL scales it. The‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2C8SgtORkj ‚Äî X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 30, 2025 Relevant agencies are tasked with encouraging U.S. leadership in developing modern financial technologies, especially those that enhance cross-border transaction efficiency. The report also emphasizes the need to convene financial institutions to adopt and lead these advancements. In simple terms, the federal government is calling for exactly what Ripple is already doing. Ripple: Built for This Moment As noted by X Finance Bull in a recent post on X, ‚ÄúThe U.S. just told you what it needs and it‚Äôs not Bitcoin‚Ä¶ Ripple is the leading U.S.-based company building that future. XRP powers it. RLUSD connects it. ODL scales it.‚Äù Many in the XRP community believe that Ripple is poised to collaborate with governments, leveraging its technology to meet their needs for efficient and reliable payment systems. Ripple‚Äôs On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product leverages XRP to facilitate instant, low-cost, cross-border transactions without the need for pre-funded accounts. It solves the very problems the report identifies: delays, high costs, and lack of interoperability in global payment systems. Further enhancing this system is RLUSD, Ripple‚Äôs U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin launched in December 2024. RLUSD enables efficient on-chain settlements while burning a small amount of XRP with each transaction, adding a deflationary utility to the asset. Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure is not only functional but also scalable, regulated, and institutionally compliant. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulation-Friendly and Institutionally Viable One of the most critical takeaways from the White House report is its emphasis on supporting technologies that can be regulated. Bitcoin, while dominant in market cap, exists outside the traditional financial framework, making it harder for governments to endorse directly. Ripple, on the other hand, has built its business model around regulatory cooperation. The report advocates for protecting the two-tier banking system, safeguarding personal financial privacy, and promoting private-sector innovation. Ripple fits into this framework seamlessly, providing financial institutions with tools to modernize without displacing the core banking infrastructure. XRP Positioned for Global Utility Ripple already has a global presence with payment corridors spanning Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe. With the U.S. government now prioritizing the very innovations Ripple provides, the alignment between public policy and Ripple‚Äôs business model couldn‚Äôt be stronger. For the XRP Army, this is more than a policy win; it‚Äôs strategic validation. The United States is defining the future of global finance, and Ripple is already building it. XRP, the digital asset at the center of this ecosystem, is now more relevant than ever. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-31 11:00:00,49295793,1753959600,Trump-Appointed Group Calls For Easier Crypto Regulations From Federal Authorities,"A task force established by President Donald Trump has issued a comprehensive crypto report advocating for clearer regulations governing digital asset markets. Released on Wednesday, the report calls on federal regulators to utilize their existing authority to create more definitive rules surrounding the trading of digital assets, thereby facilitating the adoption of innovative financial products. White House Crypto Report According to Bloomberg, the White House described the report as an essential step toward positioning the United States at the forefront of the blockchain revolution. ‚ÄúBy implementing these recommendations, policymakers can usher in the Golden Age of Crypto,‚Äù officials stated in a fact sheet accompanying the report from the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Related Reading: BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC Formed through an executive order signed by Trump in January, the task force has proposed a variety of policy measures aimed at addressing the complexities of the digital asset landscape. Among its key recommendations is the urgent passage of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which seeks to eliminate regulatory gaps by granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority to oversee spot markets for non-security digital assets. The report also emphasizes the need to embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies as a vital component of the evolving financial ecosystem. The report also urges both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC to act swiftly, providing clarity on critical issues such as registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping to enable federal-level trading of digital assets. Bitcoin Reserve With 198,000 Seized Coins These recommendations come on the heels of Trump‚Äôs recent signing of a congressional bill called the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, marking a significant victory for the cryptocurrency industry. This new law establishes rules for US dollar-backed stablecoins, which proponents believe will pave the way for broader integration of digital assets into the financial system. The White House has indicated that additional details about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be forthcoming. This reserve is expected to consist of approximately 198,000 Bitcoin that the government has seized from criminal cases and other proceedings. Related Reading: XRP Traders Pull Back $2.4B‚ÄîBrace For Impact Or Buy The Dip? An executive order issued earlier this year mandated that the Treasury Department retain these Bitcoin holdings, with directives to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more. The report also addresses other crucial issues, including the need for clarity on Bank Secrecy Act obligations to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. On tax policy, it recommends that Congress classify digital assets as a new category subjected to modified tax rules applicable to securities or commodities. Furthermore, it calls for legislation to extend wash sale rules to digital assets, preventing investors from claiming tax losses on securities if they repurchase similar assets within a designated timeframe.

2025-07-31 10:59:33,49297791,1753959573,XRP to $15 after ETF approval? Investors are accumulating its rival RTX instead,"There‚Äôs been a lot of noise lately around XRP, and for good reason. After years of legal drama, Ripple is finally getting back on its feet. Now, with talk of a possible XRP ETF heating up, traders are wondering: could XRP price prediction to $15 come true? It‚Äôs not impossible. ETF approvals lit a fire under Bitcoin and Ethereum, and XRP might be next. If that happens, expect big money to start flowing in, especially from institutions that sat on the sidelines during the SEC years. But while the ETF chatter has XRP in the spotlight, there‚Äôs another project quietly gaining traction: Remittix (RTX). And it could deliver even more upside, without needing a Wall Street stamp of approval. What‚Äôs fueling the XRP optimism? Since Ripple began settling regulatory disputes, confidence in XRP has rebounded. Its global use case for cross-border payments, especially in corridors across Asia and the Middle East, positions it well for large-scale financial adoption. With growing speculation about a Ripple ETF, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum‚Äôs successful ETF launches, some traders are pricing in a significant rally. XRP is currently stuck between $2.9 to $3.3, but some analysts and a few price models suggest that a proper ETF approval could help pull in more demand for the coin, such that it could go on to hit $5 or even $10 before this bull cycle elapses. Why the quiet shift toward RTX? RTX isn‚Äôt trying to be the next meme coin. It‚Äôs built for something practical: cross-border payments. Anyone who‚Äôs tried sending money abroad knows how clunky, slow, and expensive it can be. Remittix is trying to fix that with blockchain tech. Right now, Remittix has already raised over $20 million, and the pace is picking up, especially with the ongoing $250,000 massive crypto giveaway. The team recently launched a beta wallet waitlist and expanded into regions like Latin America and Southeast Asia, where remittances matter. XRP vs RTX: different roads, different speeds There‚Äôs no doubt XRP price prediction could hold. If that ETF becomes a reality, it could bring serious momentum; a $10‚Äì$15 price isn‚Äôt out of the question. But it‚Äôs also a large-cap token now, meaning the 100x days are likely behind it. Remittix, on the other hand, is just getting started. It has utility, traction, and a growing community, and because it‚Äôs still early, some are betting the real gains are here. In essence? XRP is back in play, but RTX is quietly building something that could run even harder. One‚Äôs a comeback story. The other‚Äôs a fresh start, with a use case people need.

2025-07-31 10:59:19,49297790,1753959559,"Dogecoin aims for $1 as Elon‚Äôs X payment rumours resurface, but has smart money already started rotating elsewhere?","Dogecoin price prediction is front and centre as rumours swirl about Elon Musk bringing DOGE to X Payments. This week, renewed chatter around X Money and potential DOGE integration sparked a 5% rally in DOGE along with surging social sentiment. Yet as excitement builds, smart money may already be shifting. A quiet DeFi token with real utility just unveiled a mobile‚Äëfirst wallet ahead of a Q3 launch. It‚Äôs drawing interest from traders seeking structured value beyond meme hype. Dogecoin rally heats up on X payment hype: pattern targets near $0.40 Dogecoin trades around $0.221 following a surge tied to X Payment rumors. Analysts note an 80% climb potential to $0.42 if the double‚Äëbottom pattern holds, supported by whale buys and tweet volume spikes. Crypto expert, Ali Martinez, has said on his X (formerly Twitter) account that Dogecoin price could be preparing for a rebound . This is so because the TD Sequential for Dogecoin presents a buy signal on the 4-hour chart. However, a retreat under $0.20 risks derailing sentiment, unless X actually rolls out DOGE support or official partnership announcements appear. Best crypto to buy: why Remittix (RTX) may be where smart money is going Remittix just revealed its mobile wallet with Ethereum and Solana network support ahead of a planned Q3 launch. The interface promises cross‚Äëchain DeFi, ultra‚Äëlow gas fees, staking and global payments tools. Analysts call it a scalable payments engine for crypto transactions. Compared to Dogecoin‚Äôs social‚Äëdriven model, Remittix has built real utility, audited security, and staking-driven community engagement. While DOGE rides Elon‚Äôs narrative, this token builds tech, rewards users, and aims to serve real customers from day one. Key reasons Remittix stands out as the best crypto to buy: Real‚ÄëWorld Utility: Built for actual transactions, not just speculation Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Wallet Coming Q3: Mobile‚Äëfirst interface with real‚Äëtime FX conversion 20% Referral Rewards: Earn RTX by sharing the project Over $17.8 Million Raised: One of the fastest‚Äëgrowing early stage crypto campaigns Analysts label it a next big altcoin 2025 and a new altcoin to watch, especially for those seeking crypto with passive income potential or low cap crypto gems. Act now while utility drives smart rotation Dogecoin price prediction shows bullish potential if X Payments rumors become real. But momentum depends heavily on Elon and platform integration. Smart money appears to be shifting toward tokens with defined infrastructure. With a $250,000 giveaway active now, Remittix offers real world change via cross‚Äëchain staking, low fees, global payments, and fiat support down the line.

2025-07-31 10:59:07,49295782,1753959547,Circle's Hidden Revenue Engine,"Summary Circle's growth potential extends far beyond USDC reserve yield. They have a secret weapon. I project Circle's total revenues could reach $12 billion by 2030, driven by high-margin software and fintech services integrated with stablecoins. Circle's Q2 earnings will be pivotal, especially regarding USDC adoption, platform revenue growth, and updates on the Coinbase revenue-sharing agreement. Despite risks like rate sensitivity and USDT competition, I see over 50% upside in 3-4 years, making this dip a compelling buy opportunity. Thesis Summary Circle ( CRCL ) has come a long way since its IPO, but after some initial hype, the excitement seems to have faded somewhat. While the valuation today may seem rich, I believe investors may be overlooking some of the key growth drivers behind Circle, which go well beyond income derived from USDC. As we approach Q2, I expect some of these other growth engines will begin to become even more apparent. In my opinion, Circle could still see over 50% upside in the next 3-4 years, and investors would do well to buy this dip. Circle‚Äôs Secret Revenue Engine In my opinion, there are two areas where Circle stands to make significant revenues. Reserve Yield Reserve yield is, of course, the main source of income right now. There‚Äôs around $60 billion in circulation of USDC, and Circle earns yield through the Treasury holdings that back up this USDC. Circle generated around $1.5 billion in revenues from this last year, and this is taking into account the fact that Coinbase ( COIN ) took about 50% of this due to their revenue share agreement. However, this can easily scale to become a much larger market, as I discussed in my last article. Furthermore, there may be room to renegotiate the Coinbase revenue split after 2026, which could potentially be very bullish for Circle. Infrastructure/API Monetization But there‚Äôs a lot more juice left to squeeze in other areas, and this is what investors are overlooking right now. Circle is now offering API-based services like programmable payments and smart contract infrastructure, as well as digital on-chain treasury services. It‚Äôs still early days, but this could be a very lucrative side of the business for Circle. The idea is that as more people want to interact with stablecoins, Circle will also play an integral role in allowing parties to build software using USDC. In other words, Circle will become the backbone of any digital infrastructure that uses USDC. These revenues will be sticky and have high margins too. And there‚Äôs also room for Circle to benefit from becoming a key player in cross-border payments. The company could earn money from infrastructure fees, especially when it comes to high-volume FX platforms. Revenue Forecast If Circle executes on this roadmap, here‚Äôs how its revenues could play out by 2030. Reserve Yield Revenue There‚Äôs an argument to be made that this could grow to around $7.5 billion by 2030, which I forecasted in my last piece. Yield earnings (Author's work) Infrastructure/API Revenue This is a bit harder to forecast, but let's try to crunch some numbers. According to some estimates, the fintech software could be worth $1.5 trillion by 2033 . With stablecoins potentially being integrated as a common payment option, Circle could easily capture at least 1-2% in service fees from large enterprises. This would bring in at least a further $2B in revenues by 2030. Circle could also add another $1 billion through smart contract and wallet infrastructure. The smart contract market could grow to $9.2 billion by 2032 . If USDC becomes the stablecoin of choice, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine these kinds of revenues materialising. And with cross-border payments being a $200 trillion market , there‚Äôs definitely room for Circle to extract a couple of billion by 2030. The Big Picture All in all, there‚Äôs a lot of untapped potential here for Circle to benefit from a lot more than interest earnings. By 2030, I‚Äôd say we could be looking at other segments adding around $5 billion in revenues, which puts my total revenue forecast at $12 billion, making Circle a steal in my opinion. Assuming we can reach an EBITDA margin of 30% (due to higher margin software revenues), that‚Äôs $3.6 billion in earnings, and applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 20, in line with what a mature software company could command, then the total market cap would be close to $72 billion. What to Watch in Q2 Earnings Circle‚Äôs upcoming Q2 results will be crucial in determining whether this narrative can be supported by facts. For starters, we will have to see how the adoption of USDC is going and if the total float is growing. In terms of Platform revenue, this is where we will want to see Circle talk about any potential partnerships or expansions in this segment. It‚Äôs important for Circle to start building out now in order to gain a first mover advantage. And lastly, any update on the Coinbase agreement could really change investor sentiment. Risks But risks still remain with Circle. Rate sensitivity is, of course, top of this list. Second would be competition from USDT, which is still very much competing with Circle to be the dominant USD stablecoin. And it remains to be seen just how fast other regions will adopt stablecoin regulation. Final Thoughts A lot of investors see limited upside from Circle‚Äôs current revenue model, especially since rates are coming down, but they are missing the big picture. Circle stands to make at least as much, if not more, money in the future from stablecoin-adjacent businesses like enterprise software, smart contracts, and digital payments.",COIN|CRCL,EN,1,summary circle growth potential extends far beyond usdc reserve yield secret weapon project circle total revenue could reach billion driven software fintech service integrated stablecoins circle earnings pivotal especially regarding usdc adoption platform revenue growth update coinbase agreement despite risk like rate sensitivity usdt competition see upside year making dip compelling buy opportunity thesis summary circle crcl come long way since ipo initial hype excitement seems faded somewhat valuation today may seem rich believe investor may overlooking key growth driver behind circle go well beyond income derived usdc approach expect growth engine begin become even apparent opinion circle could still see upside next year investor would well buy dip circle secret revenue engine opinion two area circle stand make significant revenue reserve yield reserve yield course main source income right around billion circulation usdc circle earns yield treasury holding back usdc circle generated around billion revenue last year taking account fact coinbase coin took due revenue share agreement however easily scale become much larger market discussed last article furthermore may room renegotiate coinbase revenue split could potentially bullish circle monetization lot juice left squeeze area investor overlooking right circle offering service like programmable payment smart contract infrastructure well digital treasury service still early day could lucrative side business circle idea people want interact stablecoins circle also play integral role allowing party build software using usdc word circle become backbone digital infrastructure us usdc revenue sticky high margin also room circle benefit becoming key player payment company could earn money infrastructure fee especially come fx platform revenue forecast circle executes roadmap revenue could play reserve yield revenue argument made could grow around billion forecasted last piece yield earnings author work revenue bit harder forecast let try crunch number according estimate fintech software could worth trillion stablecoins potentially integrated common payment option circle could easily capture least service fee large enterprise would bring least revenue circle could also add another billion smart contract wallet infrastructure smart contract market could grow billion usdc becomes stablecoin choice hard imagine kind revenue materialising payment trillion market definitely room circle extract couple billion big picture lot untapped potential circle benefit lot interest earnings say could looking segment adding around billion revenue put total revenue forecast billion making circle steal opinion assuming reach ebitda margin due higher margin software revenue billion earnings applying multiple line mature software company could command total market cap would close billion watch earnings circle upcoming result crucial determining whether narrative supported fact starter see adoption usdc going total float growing term platform revenue want see circle talk potential partnership expansion segment important circle start building order gain first mover advantage lastly update coinbase agreement could really change investor sentiment risk risk still remain circle rate sensitivity course top list second would competition usdt still much competing circle dominant usd stablecoin remains seen fast region adopt stablecoin regulation final thought lot investor see limited upside circle current revenue model especially since rate coming missing big picture circle stand make least much money future business like enterprise software smart contract digital payment,0.039,0.757,0.204,0.9977,1

2025-07-31 10:55:10,49295621,1753959310,Pioneering Progress: AllUnity‚Äôs Secure Euro Stablecoin EURAU Launched,"BitcoinWorld Pioneering Progress: AllUnity‚Äôs Secure Euro Stablecoin EURAU Launched In the ever-evolving landscape of digital finance, the launch of a new stablecoin often sparks considerable interest. However, when that stablecoin is a euro stablecoin backed by some of the most prominent names in traditional finance and fully compliant with stringent European regulations, it signals a potentially transformative moment. AllUnity, a new venture supported by powerhouses like Deutsche Bank‚Äôs DWS Group, Dutch market maker Flow Traders, and financial services provider Galaxy Digital Inc., has officially unveiled EURAU. This groundbreaking digital asset is poised to redefine how we perceive and utilize the euro in the digital realm. For years, the crypto community has yearned for a robust, reliable, and regulatory-compliant euro-pegged stablecoin. EURAU‚Äôs arrival on the Ethereum blockchain, meticulously collateralized by reserves held in European banks and fully aligned with the EU‚Äôs pioneering Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, is not just another token launch; it‚Äôs a strategic move to bridge the gap between conventional financial systems and the burgeoning digital economy. AllUnity CEO Alexander H√∂ptner highlighted its dual purpose: serving both dynamic crypto markets and practical corporate payment use cases. Let‚Äôs delve into what makes this particular euro stablecoin a significant leap forward. What Makes This Euro Stablecoin a Game Changer? The credibility of any stablecoin hinges on its backing and regulatory adherence. AllUnity‚Äôs EURAU stands out due to its formidable institutional support and its commitment to compliance, factors that are crucial for widespread adoption and trust. This isn‚Äôt just a promise; it‚Äôs a verifiable structure designed for stability and reliability. Institutional Heavyweights: The involvement of Deutsche Bank‚Äôs DWS Group, Flow Traders, and Galaxy Digital Inc. provides EURAU with an unparalleled level of legitimacy and financial strength. These entities bring decades of experience in asset management, market making, and digital asset services, ensuring robust infrastructure and market liquidity. Full Collateralization: Unlike some stablecoins that have faced scrutiny over their reserves, EURAU is explicitly stated to be fully collateralized by reserves held at European banks. This transparency and direct backing by traditional financial institutions are paramount for maintaining its peg to the euro and reassuring users of its stability. Strategic Launch on Bullish: The decision to list EURAU first on Bullish, a regulated crypto exchange built for institutions, further underscores AllUnity‚Äôs focus on serving professional and institutional clients. This initial placement signals a commitment to liquidity and a secure trading environment from day one. The collective strength of these factors positions EURAU as more than just a digital currency; it‚Äôs a foundational piece for a more integrated financial future. The backing by such established names addresses a key concern for institutional investors and corporations looking to enter the crypto space with confidence, making this euro stablecoin a truly attractive option. How Does AllUnity‚Äôs EURAU Stablecoin Ensure Security and Compliance? In the world of stablecoins, security and regulatory compliance are not just buzzwords; they are the bedrock upon which trust is built. AllUnity has meticulously designed EURAU to meet the highest standards, particularly by aligning with the EU‚Äôs groundbreaking MiCA framework. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is a landmark piece of legislation in the European Union, designed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets. For stablecoins, MiCA introduces stringent requirements concerning: Issuance and Authorization: Only authorized entities can issue stablecoins, subject to strict oversight. Reserve Requirements: Issuers must maintain sufficient, segregated, and liquid reserves that are regularly audited. This directly addresses the ‚Äòfull collateralization by reserves at European banks‚Äô aspect of EURAU. Redemption Rights: Users must have clear rights to redeem their stablecoins at par value with the underlying asset. Operational Resilience: Requirements for robust IT systems, security protocols, and governance structures. Consumer Protection: Enhanced transparency, disclosure, and complaint handling mechanisms. By adhering to MiCA, EURAU offers a level of regulatory certainty and consumer protection that is often lacking in the broader crypto market. This compliance is a significant differentiator, establishing EURAU as a ‚Äòregulated‚Äô stablecoin, which is crucial for attracting institutional adoption and facilitating its use in traditional financial contexts. The commitment to these rigorous standards ensures that EURAU is not only technologically sound but also legally robust and reliable, solidifying its position as a secure euro stablecoin . Beyond Crypto: Where Will This Euro Stablecoin Make an Impact? While the immediate thought for any stablecoin might be its utility within decentralized finance (DeFi) or crypto trading, AllUnity‚Äôs EURAU is designed with a broader vision. Its applications extend far beyond the typical crypto ecosystem, aiming to revolutionize traditional financial operations. AllUnity CEO Alexander H√∂ptner explicitly stated that EURAU aims to serve both crypto markets and corporate payment use cases. Let‚Äôs explore these two significant areas of impact: 1. Crypto Markets: Enhancing Liquidity and Stability Trading Pairs: EURAU provides a highly stable and liquid euro-pegged asset for trading against various cryptocurrencies, offering an alternative to USD-pegged stablecoins. This can attract more European traders and institutions into the crypto space. DeFi Integration: As a compliant and transparent euro stablecoin , EURAU is well-positioned to integrate into DeFi protocols, enabling euro-denominated lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities, potentially reducing foreign exchange risk for European users. Arbitrage Opportunities: Its strong peg and institutional backing can facilitate efficient arbitrage between crypto exchanges and traditional financial markets, enhancing overall market efficiency. 2. Corporate Payment Use Cases: Streamlining Global Transactions This is where EURAU could truly shine, offering significant advantages over traditional banking rails for businesses: Faster Cross-Border Payments: Traditional international payments can be slow and expensive. EURAU, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, can facilitate near-instantaneous and cost-effective cross-border transactions, enabling businesses to manage global cash flows more efficiently. Treasury Management: Corporations can use EURAU for digital treasury management, holding euros on-chain for faster deployment, settlement, and reconciliation, especially for companies with significant European operations or international trade. Supply Chain Finance: Payments within complex supply chains can be tokenized using EURAU, allowing for programmable payments that are triggered automatically upon fulfillment of contractual obligations, increasing transparency and reducing payment delays. Reduced FX Volatility: For businesses dealing in euros, using a euro-pegged stablecoin can mitigate foreign exchange risks often associated with converting between fiat and other cryptocurrencies. The ability of EURAU to seamlessly integrate into both digital and traditional financial workflows positions it as a versatile tool for businesses and individuals alike, paving the way for a more efficient and interconnected global economy. This strategic versatility underscores the potential of this euro stablecoin to become a foundational element in future financial infrastructure. Navigating the Future: Potential Challenges and Opportunities for the Euro Stablecoin Market The launch of EURAU is undoubtedly a significant milestone, yet the path ahead for any new digital asset, especially a euro stablecoin , is filled with both exciting opportunities and formidable challenges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for assessing its long-term impact and adoption. Opportunities: The timing for a robust euro-pegged stablecoin could not be better. The digital transformation of finance is accelerating, and the demand for stable, regulated digital assets is growing exponentially. EURAU is well-positioned to capitalize on several key trends: Growing Demand for Non-USD Stablecoins: While USD stablecoins dominate, there‚Äôs a clear appetite for alternatives, particularly in Europe, where businesses and individuals prefer to transact in their native currency. Institutional Adoption: The backing by major financial players not only lends credibility but also opens doors to broader institutional adoption. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring blockchain technology, and a compliant euro stablecoin provides a secure entry point. MiCA as a Catalyst: Rather than a hurdle, MiCA can be a significant advantage. Its clarity provides a regulatory sandbox for compliant stablecoins, fostering trust and encouraging hesitant investors and businesses to participate. Innovation in Payments: EURAU can drive innovation in payment systems, offering a glimpse into a future where cross-border transactions are instant, transparent, and cost-effective, potentially spurring competition and efficiency across the financial sector. Challenges: Despite its strong foundations, EURAU will face competition and evolving market dynamics: Competition from Other Euro Stablecoins: While EURAU boasts unique backing, it is not the only euro-pegged stablecoin in the market. Competition from established players or new entrants could fragment liquidity. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): The ongoing development of a digital euro by the European Central Bank (ECB) presents a long-term challenge. While private stablecoins and CBDCs can coexist, the regulatory landscape might shift, and the ECB‚Äôs digital euro could eventually dominate the official digital currency space. Market Acceptance and Education: Despite its strong backing, widespread adoption requires significant education and market acceptance. Overcoming inertia and convincing traditional businesses to integrate blockchain-based payment solutions will be a continuous effort. Technological Evolution: The blockchain space is dynamic. AllUnity will need to continuously adapt to new technological advancements, security threats, and network upgrades to maintain EURAU‚Äôs competitive edge and ensure its long-term viability on the Ethereum network. Ultimately, EURAU‚Äôs success will depend on its ability to leverage its unique strengths ‚Äì institutional backing and regulatory compliance ‚Äì to overcome these challenges and demonstrate tangible value propositions to a broad user base, both within and beyond the crypto sphere. The journey of this euro stablecoin will be a fascinating case study in the evolving digital financial landscape. In conclusion, AllUnity‚Äôs launch of EURAU represents a significant stride in the journey towards mainstream digital currency adoption. With the formidable backing of Deutsche Bank‚Äôs DWS Group, Flow Traders, and Galaxy Digital Inc., coupled with its stringent adherence to the EU‚Äôs MiCA framework, EURAU is poised to become a trusted and impactful euro stablecoin . Its dual focus on crypto markets and corporate payments highlights a strategic vision to bridge the divide between traditional finance and the decentralized world. While challenges remain, the secure and compliant nature of EURAU positions it as a pioneering force, potentially setting new standards for how digital euros are issued, managed, and utilized across the global financial ecosystem. This is more than just a token; it‚Äôs a testament to the ongoing evolution of money in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is AllUnity‚Äôs EURAU?

2025-07-31 10:53:18,49295492,1753959198,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? ‚Äì July 31, 2025","The crypto market is up today, seeing a minor uptick. Three-quarters of the top 100 coins per market have turned green over the past 24 hours. That said, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by another 3.6% to $3.96 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $154 billion. TLDR: Crypto market turned mildly green over the past day; Nine out of the top 10 coins are up; BTC and ETH saw moderate increases, trading at $118,386 and $3,860, respectively; A decisive breakout above the $105,000-$125,000 range could lead toward $141,000; US ETH spot ETFs hit the 19th day of inflows, one day short of a record; US BTC spot ETFs recorded minor positive flows of $47 million; As expected, there will be no rate cuts in the US; Should Jerome Powell be fired or begin rate cuts too early, BTC will ‚Äúrally a lot‚Äù; ‚ÄôBitcoin long-term holders still command 53% of supply despite recent distribution‚Äô. Crypto Winners & Losers Only one of the top 10 coins per market capitalization has decreased over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is largely unchanged, having increased by 0.4% in a day, now trading at $118,386. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) increased the most in this category: 1.5%, now changing hands at $3,860. While XRP appreciated 0.9% to $3.15, the large majority of these coins are up by less than 0.5% at the time of writing. On the other hand, Tron (TRX) is the only coin in the category that decreased today: 3% to $0.327. As for the top 100 coins, 75 coins are up today. Ethena (ENA) saw the only double-digit rise. It‚Äôs up 12.7% to the price of $0.6464. It‚Äôs followed by Story (IP) , with a 9.1% rise to $6.24. Other coins in this category are up 4.9% and less. On the opposite side, Tron fell the most in this category as well, followed by XDC Network (XDC) , with a 2.8% drop to $0.09755. Other red coins are down 1.7% and less per coin. The markets across the board, crypto included, have reacted to comments from the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that largely squashed any hopes for a rate cut in the coming month. Powell said that the Fed first needs to see more data that would allow it to estimate the tariffs‚Äô effect on inflation. That said, even though a rate cut would be positive for crypto, suggesting that a lack of news suggesting a cut would dampen the market‚Äôs performance, the crypto market is proving its resiliency yet again with the day‚Äôs moderate uptick. Notably, there are positive financial reports coming from major companies. Robinhood‚Äôs crypto revenue jumped 98% to $160 million . For Q2 2025, it reported revenue of $989 million, a 45% year-on-year increase. Robinhood Markets has just released financial results for the second quarter of 2025.

A decisive breakout above this range could ‚Äúshift market dynamics‚Äù and make way for a move toward $141,000. The latter is an area where ‚Äúprofit-taking could sharply intensify‚Äù and which is likely to see increased sell-side pressure due to the high unrealized profit expected there. On the other hand, there is a light volume zone between $110,000 and $115,000. This is ‚Äúa critical area to monitor should a market pullback occur.‚Äù Also, additional metrics show ‚Äúlatent sell-side pressure,‚Äù the researchers noted. #Bitcoin 's Unrealized Profit as a percentage of Market Cap broke above the +2œÉ band, a level historically tied to euphoric phases. The setup mirrors previous ATH environments, reinforcing latent sell-side pressure. pic.twitter.com/3DyZ8q1vlf ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 30, 2025 Meanwhile, many industry insiders commented on the US Fed news. Tom Bruni, VP of Community at Stocktwits , described the FOMC meeting as ‚Äúuneventful with rates staying unchanged.‚Äù Most expect the September meeting to be the first cut. That said, Powell‚Äôs commentary is ‚Äúthe wildcard, as the Fed‚Äôs updated economic projections in June already told the story of slowing growth and sticky inflation,‚Äù Bruni says. ‚ÄúHowever, after a record run from the April lows, the stock market and other risk assets have stalled as the market‚Äôs focus shifts to earnings season.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe pause in momentum suggests that investors/traders are looking for reasons to sell in this environment, so any unexpected comments or Q&As from Powell could trigger some weakness,‚Äù Bruni writes. Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata , added that should Powell be fired or begin to cut rates too early, hard assets, especially BTC especially, could ‚Äúrally a lot while inflation and bonds would lose a lot of value.‚Äù You may also like: Bitcoin Liquidity Was Tested, But Investor Supermajority Stays in Profit Bitcoin (BTC)‚Äôs liquidity faced ‚Äúa significant test‚Äù over the past weekend, following the exit of a Satoshi-era whale.

2025-07-31 10:51:33,49297789,1753959093,"ADA comeback story: why experts say ADA could hit $3, but RTX may outrun it","Cardano price is back in focus after weeks of steady rebuilding. Traders see a clear setup on higher time frames, and some think the next leg could take ADA near $3. At the same time, Remittix is showing fast traction, catching eyes as a crypto with real utility and a best crypto project 2025 candidate. Cardano price prediction: cup and handle points to $3 Source: TradingView Analysts tracking Cardano price highlight a classic cup and handle pattern . The cup stretched from the 2021 peak near $3.10 down to the 2022 low around $0.24, then the handle formed between $0.75 and $0.92. Crypto Smith notes whales look finished accumulating while Cardano tests the $0.92 breakout line. If Cardano price closes above that level with volume, targets open toward $1.50 and then $3, with some models pointing even higher over time. Momentum is improving, the 50‚Äëday EMA is rising, and the RSI sits in neutral territory, which leaves room for trend follow‚Äëthrough. Cardano price is still sensitive to liquidity swings and headline risk. A failed push above $0.92 could send ADA to retest $0.80 support. Traders will watch on‚Äëchain flows, funding, and how quickly dips are bought. Broader market tone matters too. If risk appetite fades, rotations often favor low cap crypto gems and next big altcoin 2025 narratives. For long‚Äëterm holders, Cardano ADA still ranks in best long term crypto investment discussions, yet some capital is exploring new alt ideas. Remittix (RTX): the runner many think can outpace ADA by 2026 Remittix is a payment‚Äëfirst token built around low gas fee crypto transfers and real usage. The team reports $17.8M raised with 575M RTX sold at $0.0876. A wallet beta with full crypto wallet functionality is slated for 09/15/2025. That roadmap, plus early traction, is why some label RTX a next 100x crypto and a top crypto under $1 to watch. If adoption scales, it could be the best new altcoin in a cross‚Äëchain DeFi project stack. Linking the thesis to action, here is what stands out: Utility‚Äëfirst Remittix DeFi project serving global senders and earners Low gas fees and fast settlement designed for everyday payments Growing visibility on centralised exchanges and activity on a decentralised exchange watchlist Strong community growth as users look to buy RTX token for access and rewards Roadmap aimed at crypto solving real world problems, not hype cycles Positioned as a high growth crypto with best crypto project 2025 potential Across the market, Cardano price strength can coexist with new leaders.

Shiba Inu flames ignite hopes of a 2021‚Äëstyle rally Shiba Inu‚Äôs price dipped before whale buying provided support, lifting SHIB back above its 200‚Äëday moving average. That accumulation is reminiscent of the conditions that fueled the 2021 rally, when meme‚Äëcoin euphoria and viral social buzz drove parabolic moves. Burn dynamics have also shifted. A single wallet burned 600.7‚ÄØmillion SHIB in one transaction, sending the burn rate up more than 16,700‚ÄØ% in 24‚ÄØhours. Removing tokens from circulation in this way can amplify bullish sentiment, as fewer coins remain available for trading. On‚Äëchain activity tells a mixed story. While daily swap volumes surged, Shibarium‚Äôs Layer‚ÄØ2 network TVL has plunged from $6.44‚ÄØmillion in December 2024 to $1.78‚ÄØmillion today, reflecting waning DeFi engagement on the platform. Without fresh protocol upgrades or mainstream use‚Äëcase integrations, sustaining momentum beyond short‚Äëterm whale support may prove challenging for Shiba Inu traders. Remittix rockets with real‚Äëworld power Amid meme‚Äëcoin drama, Remittix‚Äôs PayFi proposition is gaining traction. RTX has raised over $17.8‚ÄØmillion at $0.0876 per token, selling 575‚ÄØmillion RTX in its ongoing presale, and is expecting a wallet beta launching full crypto‚Äëto‚Äëbank transfers in 30+ countries. Pilots in Ghana and Kenya have processed over $28‚ÄØmillion in cross‚Äëborder transfers this month, and a $250‚ÄØ000 giveaway has driven rapid wallet registrations. Here‚Äôs why Remittix stands out as the Best Crypto To Buy Now for utility seekers: Solving a real‚Äëworld $19‚ÄØtrillion payments problem Direct crypto‚Äëto‚Äëbank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK ‚Äî built with trust and transparency Wallet beta launches this quarter (Q3‚ÄØ2025) 50‚ÄØ% token bonus is still live for early backers These capabilities position Remittix to take over the altcoin space, marrying practical utility with rapid growth and setting a new standard for what a crypto project can achieve. Which train to board: meme dream or utility stream? Shiba Inu‚Äôs whale‚Äëled accumulation and burn‚Äërate mania echo the patterns that sent prices skyrocketing in 2021. However, sustaining those gains without new catalysts or broad-based adoption may be difficult. Remittix, by contrast, offers a pragmatic narrative: tackling high‚Äëcost remittance corridors with low‚Äëfee rails, audited security, and real‚Äëworld pilot success‚Äîall amplified by a $250‚ÄØ000 community giveaway. For traders weighing speculative meme‚Äëcoin rallies against utility‚Äëdriven growth, RTX‚Äôs 484‚ÄØ% surge and payment‚Äërail deployments present a compelling case. Ultimately, deciding between Shiba Inu‚Äôs nostalgia‚Äëfueled rallies and Remittix‚Äôs real‚Äëworld use may come down to risk tolerance. Those seeking fast, sentiment‚Äëdriven pumps may back SHIB, while others aiming for sustainable adoption and tangible ROI drivers could find Remittix‚Äôs model more appealing.

2025-07-31 10:48:20,49295877,1753958900,"NEAR Protocol Surges on Institutional Buying, Recovers 8% from Key Support Zone","NEAR Protocol demonstrated formidable resilience during the July 30-31 trading session, recovering sharply from mid-session lows of $2.52 to close at $2.73. The bounce‚Äîamounting to an 8.27% rebound‚Äîcoincided with high-volume activity, particularly among corporate trading desks and institutional asset managers. Analysts interpret this as a sign of strategic accumulation, likely driven by growing confidence in NEAR's enterprise blockchain ambitions. Institutional activity was most evident on July 30 between 18:00 and 19:00, when NEAR experienced a steep drop from $2.68 to $2.52 on a volume spike exceeding 9.60 million shares. This selloff defined a critical accumulation zone. From that base, NEAR steadily recovered through the overnight session, with corporate traders defending the $2.52 support level and methodically accumulating positions. The final trading hour on July 31‚Äîfrom 09:05 to 10:04‚Äîoffered further evidence of institutional participation. While headline gains for that hour were modest at just 0.15%, sustained volume surges above 28,000 shares per transaction pushed NEAR through resistance at $2.725. Strategic buys at 09:17, 09:25, 09:52, and 10:01 highlighted coordinated positioning by sophisticated investors preparing for longer-term enterprise adoption. Industry experts note that NEAR‚Äôs performance is emblematic of a broader trend in which institutional investors selectively allocate capital to Layer 1 blockchain protocols with perceived enterprise integration potential. Technical Analysis Summary: Trading Range: $2.52 (support) to $2.74 (resistance), representing 7.83% volatility. Volume Spike: 9.60 million shares traded during July 30 18:00‚Äì19:00 selloff.

The exchange added more than 80 new spot trading pairs during the month, pushing its total number of spot pairs beyond 300. Its futures market now includes over 380 pairs. The boost in activity brought BTCC‚Äôs daily spot trading volume to over $4.5 million in the first three weeks of July. According to the exchange, the uptick was largely driven by heightened interest in newly listed tokens such as SPX6900 (SPX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Movement (MOVE), Magic Eden (ME), Useless Coin (USELESS), Vine Coin (VINE), and Zora (ZORA). These additions were selected based on emerging trends and trading momentum in the broader market. ‚ÄúThe spot market is incredibly dynamic, and we're making it a key priority in the coming months to drive our continued growth,‚Äù said Alex Hung, Head of Operations at BTCC. ‚ÄúWe've seen tremendous momentum as crypto markets recover, which is why we've been rapidly expanding our spot listings since Q2 this year.‚Äù BTCC‚Äôs spot market has traditionally been anchored by high-volume tokens such as BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and MANTA.

The initiative highlights trending assets like SPK, PENGU, and PUMP, and offers trading rewards aimed at increasing user engagement across both new and existing user bases. The latest wave of listings reflects BTCC‚Äôs strategy to adapt quickly to market demand and expand its catalog with a mix of established cryptocurrencies, DeFi tokens, and lesser-known altcoins.

2025-07-31 10:45:05,49295188,1753958705,Early Buyers Rejoice: Shark-Costume Cat Might Be Among the 8 Best Cryptos for Passive Income This Quarter,"If the internet had a spirit animal, it‚Äôd probably be wearing shades, flopping offbeat in a halftime show, and moonwalking straight through crypto charts. Welcome to the meme coin jungle of 2025, where $PEPE‚Äôs still croaking loud, $BONK is barking up gains, and a certain presale has just whipped out a shark costume and stolen center stage. This isn‚Äôt your average meme coin roundup. Trollercat is heating things up with its Stage 15 presale in full swing, over $425,000 already raised, and a pricing model that literally rewards fast paws. At the current price of $0.0001063, investors are staring at a whopping 2024.8% ROI to date, with 399.72% gains still on the table if scooped now. And here‚Äôs the kicker: every second you wait, the next stage ticks closer. Delay? That‚Äôs a pricier pounce. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) What do you get when you cross Ethereum smart contracts with meme lore, 69% APY staking, and a trolling space cat in a shark suit? Answer: Troller Cat. This token isn‚Äôt here to blend in; it‚Äôs here to redefine how crypto pranks should play out. Built on Ethereum with a 26-stage presale themed around history‚Äôs biggest trolls, Trollercat presale isn‚Äôt following the market; it‚Äôs dancing circles around it. Stage 15 is called the Left Shark Moment, and it lives up to the name. Just like that iconic halftime moment in 2015, Troller Cat has stepped out of sync in all the right ways, flipping norms, drawing attention, and making everyone forget who was even supposed to be in charge. With over 1,600 holders, and the current price set at $0.00010624, investors joining now could ride their bags up 399.72% to the listing price of $0.0005309. Say someone goes in with $45,000 at this stage, they‚Äôll bag 423,569,277 $TCAT tokens. At launch, that haul would be worth over $224,000. That‚Äôs nearly $180,000 in profit for a cat meme. No, this isn‚Äôt a joke; this is the internet‚Äôs new favorite income stream. Referral Program But wait, Troller Cat knows how to reward the entire squad. Its referral program is built for serious chain reactions. Once you invest $25 or more, you unlock your custom referral code. Use it to invite fellow degenerates, and both of you scoop 10% bonus tokens. That‚Äôs right, everyone wins, and everyone eats. This isn‚Äôt just some gimmick. Each referral grows the holder base and increases the ecosystem‚Äôs strength. Combine that with deflationary tokenomics, thanks to monthly buyback-and-burns from ad revenue, and you‚Äôre not just stacking coins, you‚Äôre feeding long-term scarcity. In a space where hype fades fast, Troller Cat‚Äôs model makes sure the laughs last, and so does the value. 2. Ponke ($PONKE) If you‚Äôre into deranged monkey energy and price charts that defy logic, $PONKE is your new obsession. Originally dropped with almost zero marketing, this coin exploded off raw meme gravity. The branding‚Äôs erratic, the community is borderline feral, and that‚Äôs exactly why it works. Ponke is becoming a cult classic among meme coin hunters. The token supply is tight, the momentum is thick, and it‚Äôs already found its way into DEX listings that smaller tokens can only dream of. Among the best cryptos for passive income, Ponke‚Äôs unpredictable swings can mean sudden windfalls for those ready to ride the jungle vines. 3. Pepe ($PEPE) The frog is far from croaking. $PEPE is still one of the best cryptos for passive income in 2025, thanks to a never-ending community and its ability to ride every trend like it invented them. It‚Äôs not just nostalgia, this amphibian has staying power. After multiple relaunches and liquidity pumps, PEPE has positioned itself as more than just a meme. It‚Äôs a brand, a token, and a legacy player that‚Äôs surprisingly solid for long-term holders looking for cheeky growth. The frog‚Äôs still hopping, and the bags are still swelling. 4. Turbo ($TURBO) Born from AI and bolstered by raw meme virality, $TURBO has gone from ‚ÄúAI-generated experiment‚Äù to a fully-fledged crypto creature with personality. Its low cap and high community activity have turned it into a favorite for those seeking quick flips and long-term hope. It also dabbles in staking initiatives, making it one of the best cryptos for passive income among low-cap memecoins. The momentum here is more than just speed, it‚Äôs pure turbocharged madness. 5. Bonk ($BONK) Solana‚Äôs poster pup is back with a bark. $BONK has continued its assault on meme territory with fast liquidity and a powerful dev team backing its every move. It‚Äôs the anti-influencer coin that somehow got embraced by all the influencers. Aside from major exchange listings, BONK has delivered consistent community updates and integrations. For those looking to diversify their meme coin picks and still chase yield, BONK remains one of the best cryptos for passive income in 2025. 6. Mubarak ($MUBARAK) Equal parts controversy and comedy, $MUBARAK is pure meme fuel. Modeled after wild viral humor and bizarre politics, this coin blew up off sheer shock value, and stayed relevant by building a strong meme-loving core. It‚Äôs unpredictable, yes, but its sudden volume spikes and high-risk/reward mechanics make it perfect for degens hunting alpha. When held at the right entry points, it‚Äôs among the best cryptos for passive income‚Ä¶ with a serious troll edge. 7. Coq Inu ($COQ) This rooster struts like it owns the barnyard, and it might. $COQ is a favorite among low-key traders who want big cocky returns. It‚Äôs got cheeky branding, aggressive Twitter play, and a vibe that screams ‚Äúbuy me ironically, profit unironically.‚Äù Volatile, yes. Rewarding, absolutely. For those bold enough to hold the rooster, this token continues to deliver strong upside potential and ranks among the best cryptos for passive income if timed right. 8. Cat in a Dog‚Äôs World ($MEW) A cat pretending to be a dog in the memecoin market? Say less. $MEW is weird, meta, and wildly self-aware. It‚Äôs got cult status on Telegram and is quietly creeping onto trader radars thanks to its charming underdog (or undercat?) narrative. With limited supply, staking mechanics, and tight liquidity control, $MEW has become a surprising candidate among the best cryptos for passive income. It‚Äôs the cat that refuses to be outbarked. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the best cryptos for passive income are Troller Cat, Ponke, Pepe, Turbo, Bonk, Mubarak, Coq Inu, and Cat in a Dog‚Äôs World. These meme coins combine humor with function, and most importantly, reward those who move fast and hold steady. Troller Cat‚Äôs Stage 15 presale is dishing out triple-digit ROI potential and a juicy referral program that sweetens the pot for early adopters. With over $425K already raised and over 1600 holders on board, this cat isn‚Äôt just dancing, it‚Äôs dominating. Pounce in now or watch this cat vanish into crypto legend.

2025-07-31 10:40:48,49294924,1753958448,Shell outperforms forecasts on Q2 earnings despite year-over-year profit slump,"Shell outperformed Wall Street targets for the second quarter of 2025, but the company‚Äôs actual earnings still fell sharply compared to a year ago. On Thursday, the British energy firm said it posted $4.26 billion in adjusted earnings between April and June, above the $3.87 billion expected by analysts tracked by LSEG and even higher than the $3.74 billion projected in its internal forecast. But that number is still well below the $6.29 billion the company pulled in during the same stretch of 2024, and also lower than its $5.58 billion haul from the first quarter of this year, according to CNBC. This earnings report followed earlier warnings from the London-listed firm about weaker trading outcomes in its integrated gas unit and confirmed losses in its chemicals and products business. Despite those hits, Shell kept investor rewards steady, announcing another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months. That brings the company to 15 straight quarters of at least $3 billion in repurchases. Shell keeps investors happy despite falling profits Shell also said its shares rose 2.5% in early trading Thursday in London after the numbers came in. CEO Wael Sawan spoke on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box Europe after the results went public, saying: ‚ÄúThe backdrop of the macro has been challenging, and what I would say is we continue on the momentum that we have in transforming Shell. On all measures, [I‚Äôm] pleased with that performance. And on the trading side, indeed, despite difficult macro, pleased with how the team has performed.‚Äù Sawan‚Äôs comments come as the company faces weaker global oil and gas prices and declining returns in key segments. Still, Shell‚Äôs performance outpaced its rivals. According to the company‚Äôs March update, it had laid out a plan to focus more on shareholder returns, increase cost savings, and double down on liquified natural gas. That appears to have worked in its favor. So far this year, Shell‚Äôs stock has climbed 8%, beating BP‚Äôs 3% gain and Exxon Mobil‚Äôs 4%, while TotalEnergies in France has dropped 2% in the same period. Shell said it‚Äôs not interested in buying out its struggling domestic rival BP. At the end of June, the company publicly dismissed any takeover speculation, stating it had ‚Äúno intention‚Äù of making an offer. Speaking on the M&A industry, Sawan said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy bigger is better. I think you have to drive it from a value perspective.‚Äù LNG strategy, cost cuts, and no U.S. listing Shell has made liquified natural gas central to its long-term strategy. It‚Äôs currently the world‚Äôs largest trader of LNG and doesn‚Äôt see the need for acquisitions to strengthen that lead. At the same time, it‚Äôs been cutting costs aggressively. Shell confirmed Thursday it had achieved $800 million in structural cost reductions in the first six months of 2025, bringing total cuts since 2022 to $3.9 billion. The company previously said it‚Äôs targeting $5 billion to $7 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2028. Meanwhile, Shell‚Äôs net debt has gone up. It ended Q2 with $43.2 billion in debt, compared to $41.5 billion at the end of the previous quarter. When asked again about the idea of moving Shell‚Äôs listing from London to New York, Sawan shut it down. ‚ÄúIt is not a live discussion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPart of the reason is actually we have been outperforming.

2025-07-31 10:40:31,49295083,1753958431,"Qualcomm reported Q3 sales of $10.37 billion, exceeding analyst estimates","On Wednesday, Qualcomm, the world‚Äôs largest supplier of modem chips, shared an optimistic quarterly forecast, reporting a 10% year-on-year revenue increase for its fiscal third quarter with chip segment sales at $10.37 billion, just barely surpassing the estimates of analysts which was $10.35 billion. Unfortunately, the company‚Äôs dependence on high-end smartphone chips and the impending loss of Apple as a modem customer have overshadowed these positive forecasts, causing a share price drop of over 6%. QCOM stock price. Source: Google Finance Apple is taking its business in-house Apple has up to now been a key client of Qualcomm‚Äôs. However, that has changed because the gadget company has decided to pivot to its own in-house modem chips, leaving Qualcomm to supply only 20% of Apple‚Äôs modem chips by 2026. Even though Apple is taking a step back from the partnership, Qualcomm has reported that its chip segment has seen sales increase. However, William McGonigle, analyst at Third Bridge, has said the increase can mostly be attributed to non-Apple customers and is largely driven by ASP (average selling price) uplift from flagship Android launches rather than broad-based volume recovery. Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Qualcomm has continued to warn that Apple‚Äôs pivot to using its own modem chips in its devices will affect its chip segment revenue. Even though Apple is not ready to make a full pivot, it has already started the process. The iPhone 16e, which launched earlier this year, was the first Apple smartphone to house a modem developed in-house and future devices are expected to be the same. Losing all the revenue that came from supplying Apple is a bummer for Qualcomm, but the company‚Äôs CEO Cristiano Amon is unbothered. He mentioned thathe‚Äôs already looking forward to an expansion of its deal to supply chip for augmented-reality glasses for brands like Meta. ‚ÄúWe have all the designs that matter right now ‚Äì the number of designs like the Meta glasses is now up to 19, and that continues to accelerate,‚Äù Amon told Reuters. Taiwan‚Äôs Mediatek is becoming a bigger rival to Qualcomm According to reports, Taiwan‚Äôs MediaTek surpassed Qualcomm this year to become the global leader in smartphone chipset market share, thanks to its dominance in affordable and mid-range segments as well as its strong growth in major markets like India. Last month, the MediaTek Dimensity 8450 was officially launched with the ultimate aim of increasing MediaTek‚Äôs share in India‚Äôs premium smartphone market. The new chipset was reportedly designed as a direct competitor of Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, and boasts an All Big Core design, advanced AI capabilities with MediaTek‚Äôs Agentic AI Engine, and enhanced gaming performance, including improved 4K video recording. The Dimensity 8450 also comes complete with an 8-core CPU, Arm Mali-G720 MC7 GPU, and supports 4K60 HDR video capture, while the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 includes a mix of performance and efficiency cores with an Adreno GPU. The launch is proof that while MediaTek has a strong presence in the sub-Rs 30,000 smartphone segment, it has set ambitious sights on expanding its influence in the premium market which is traditionally dominated by Qualcomm with its strong Android partnerships. While MediaTek‚Äôs volume leadership is commendable, it is yet to translate to revenue dominance, so as it stands, Qualcomm retains its premium market edge.

2025-07-31 10:40:10,49294962,1753958410,XRP Whales Unleash Massive Sell-Off: Is the $3 Support in Peril?,"BitcoinWorld XRP Whales Unleash Massive Sell-Off: Is the $3 Support in Peril? The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic realm, often swayed by the actions of its largest players. When these colossal holders, often dubbed ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù make significant moves, the ripple effects can be felt across the entire ecosystem. Recently, the spotlight has fallen squarely on XRP whales , whose sustained selling activity is sending jitters through the community and raising urgent questions about the digital asset‚Äôs immediate future. Are we witnessing a critical juncture for XRP, or simply a temporary blip in its journey? Understanding the Massive Sell-Off by XRP Whales : What‚Äôs Happening? Data from CryptoQuant, widely cited by financial news outlets like BeInCrypto, reveals a concerning trend: XRP whales have been offloading an average of $28 million worth of XRP daily over the past 90 days. This isn‚Äôt just a minor tremor; it‚Äôs a significant, prolonged divestment by the very entities holding the largest portions of XRP‚Äôs supply. To put this into perspective, consider the recent past. Just a few months ago, in February, similar large-scale outflows were observed, with daily sales reaching a staggering $64 million. That period of intense selling pressure directly preceded a noticeable drop in XRP‚Äôs price. The current sustained $28 million daily sell-off, while lower in peak volume, signifies a consistent erosion of demand or a deliberate move by large holders to reduce their exposure. This behavior by XRP whales is a key indicator that sophisticated investors may be taking profits or anticipating further price declines, which naturally creates downward pressure on the asset. The implications are substantial. When large volumes of an asset are sold, it increases the circulating supply available on exchanges, and if demand doesn‚Äôt match this increased supply, the price tends to fall. This fundamental economic principle is amplified in the crypto market due to its often-volatile nature and the significant influence of a few dominant players. The Critical $3 Support Level: Can XRP Whales Break It? For any asset, a ‚Äúsupport level‚Äù is a price point where buying interest is strong enough to prevent the price from falling further. For XRP, the $3 mark has emerged as a psychologically and technically significant support level. It represents a price point that, if broken, could signal a more substantial downturn, potentially triggering further sell-offs as stop-loss orders are hit and market sentiment sours. The current actions of XRP whales directly threaten this crucial threshold. Here‚Äôs why the $3 support is so vital: Psychological Barrier: Round numbers like $3 often act as significant psychological anchors for investors. Breaking below it can trigger fear and a loss of confidence. Historical Significance: While XRP has seen prices above $3 in the past (notably during its all-time high in 2018), maintaining this level in the current market climate would demonstrate resilience. Technical Analysis: Many traders and analysts view strong support levels as critical battlegrounds between buyers and sellers. A decisive break below can invalidate bullish patterns and confirm bearish trends. Despite some recent gains in XRP‚Äôs price, the underlying on-chain momentum appears to be weakening. On-chain metrics, which track transactions directly on the blockchain, provide a transparent view of market activity. A weakening momentum suggests that the underlying buying pressure and network activity that typically drive price appreciation are diminishing. This combination of persistent selling by XRP whales and weakening on-chain signals paints a cautious picture for XRP‚Äôs ability to hold its ground. Ripple Co-founder Chris Larsen‚Äôs Sales: An Additional Layer of Pressure on XRP Whales ‚Äò Impact? Adding another layer of complexity to the market dynamics are the reported sales by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. While specific details of his recent sales are not always public immediately, reports of such transactions by prominent insiders often have a disproportionate impact on market sentiment. Why is this the case? Perception of Confidence: When a co-founder or a major insider sells a significant portion of their holdings, it can be interpreted by the market as a lack of confidence in the asset‚Äôs future price potential. Investors might wonder, ‚ÄúIf the founder is selling, why should I hold?‚Äù Supply Increase: While Larsen‚Äôs sales might be a fraction of the total volume moved by anonymous XRP whales , they still contribute to the overall selling pressure, adding more supply to the market. Market Scrutiny: Such sales attract media attention and can amplify existing concerns, potentially leading to increased scrutiny and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among retail investors. It‚Äôs important to note that insiders might sell for various personal reasons, such as diversification, liquidity needs, or tax planning, which may not necessarily reflect a negative outlook on the asset itself. However, in a market already sensitive to large sell-offs by XRP whales , any additional significant sales, especially from a figure like Chris Larsen, can exacerbate existing pressures and contribute to a more volatile environment for XRP. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for XRP Holders Given the current market conditions, what should XRP holders consider? While no financial advice can guarantee outcomes, here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this period of increased volatility and the ongoing influence of XRP whales : Monitor On-Chain Data Closely: Keep an eye on reports from reputable on-chain analytics firms like CryptoQuant. Understanding the flow of XRP in and out of exchanges, as well as whale movements, can provide early signals of market shifts. Understand Support and Resistance: Familiarize yourself with key technical levels. Knowing where strong support (like the $3 level) and resistance exist can help you make more informed decisions about entry and exit points. Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the $3 support level breaks decisively. Diversify Your Portfolio: While XRP may be a significant part of your portfolio, spreading your investments across different assets can mitigate the impact of adverse movements in any single cryptocurrency. Avoid Emotional Decisions: The crypto market is prone to sudden swings. Reacting to every piece of news or price fluctuation with emotional buying or selling can lead to poor outcomes. Stick to your investment strategy. Research Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term price action is influenced by whale movements, XRP‚Äôs long-term value will depend on its utility, adoption, and the resolution of its ongoing legal challenges. Stay informed on these fundamental aspects. The sustained selling by XRP whales presents a clear challenge to XRP‚Äôs short-term price stability. The critical $3 support level is under significant pressure, and the market is keenly watching whether it can hold. While recent gains offer a glimmer of hope, the underlying on-chain momentum and the influence of major holders like Chris Larsen suggest a cautious approach is warranted. For investors, understanding these dynamics and implementing sound risk management strategies will be key to navigating the potential volatility ahead. The battle for $3 is on, and the actions of these large holders will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in its outcome. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an XRP whale ? An XRP whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of XRP, significant enough that their buying or selling activities can notably influence the market price. These are typically institutional investors, early adopters, or wealthy individuals. Why are XRP whales selling their holdings? Whales sell for various reasons, including profit-taking after price increases, portfolio rebalancing, diversification into other assets, liquidity needs, or a strategic decision based on their market outlook. The current sustained selling suggests a collective move to reduce exposure. What is the significance of the $3 support level for XRP? The $3 support level is a crucial price point where significant buying interest is expected to prevent further price declines. Breaking below it could signal a strong bearish trend and trigger more sell-offs, impacting investor confidence and market sentiment. How do insider sales (like Chris Larsen‚Äôs) affect crypto prices? Insider sales, especially from prominent figures like co-founders, can negatively impact market sentiment. Investors may perceive such sales as a lack of confidence in the asset‚Äôs future, leading to increased FUD and contributing to overall selling pressure, even if the sales are for personal reasons. Should I be worried about XRP‚Äôs price given the whale activity? While the sustained selling by XRP whales indicates significant downward pressure and potential volatility, it doesn‚Äôt automatically mean a catastrophic price crash. It‚Äôs a signal to be cautious, monitor the market closely, and reassess your risk tolerance and investment strategy. What is ‚Äúon-chain momentum‚Äù in cryptocurrency? On-chain momentum refers to the strength and direction of activity directly on a blockchain. It includes metrics like transaction volume, active addresses, and network growth. Weakening on-chain momentum for XRP suggests that the underlying network activity supporting its price might be decreasing.

2025-07-31 10:39:30,49295874,1753958370,Whale Activity Surges as Bitcoin Builds Momentum Toward New Highs,"Bitcoin BTC is witnessing a notable resurgence in accumulation activity across all investor cohorts, with whale wallets leading the charge. According to recent data from Glassnode , the number of unique whale entities, defined as those holding at least 1,000 BTC, has risen from 1,392 to 1,417 over the past week. This marks one of the highest whale counts recorded in 2025, signaling a resurgence in institutional or large-scale investor confidence. Glassnode identifies entities as clusters of addresses controlled by the same user or organization. In addition, the Accumulation Trend Score, a key on-chain metric, reveals that not only are whales accumulating aggressively, but so are the smallest holders, known as shrimps, who own less than 1 BTC. This buying pressure highlights a rare moment of alignment between retail and institutional investors. The metric breaks down accumulation strength by wallet size and recent acquisition behavior over a 15-day period. A score closer to 1 suggests strong accumulation, while a value near 0 indicates distribution. Entities such as exchanges and miners are excluded to focus on genuine investor sentiment. Importantly, this level of sustained accumulation across all cohorts has not been seen since November 2024, during President Trump's re-election. That period marked a sharp uptick in bullish sentiment and price momentum that saw bitcoin claim $100,000. Given the broad-based accumulation and the psychological boost of renewed whale interest, market observers could be increasingly confident that bitcoin is poised to challenge and potentially surpass its all-time high in the near future.",Markets|Bitcoin|bitcoin whales|Bitcoin Price|News,EN,1,bitcoin btc witnessing notable resurgence accumulation activity across investor cohort whale wallet leading charge according recent data glassnode number unique whale entity defined holding least btc risen past week mark one highest whale count recorded signaling resurgence institutional investor confidence glassnode identifies entity cluster address controlled user organization addition accumulation trend score key metric reveals whale accumulating aggressively smallest holder known shrimp less btc buying pressure highlight rare moment alignment retail institutional investor metric break accumulation strength wallet size recent acquisition behavior period score closer suggests strong accumulation value near indicates distribution entity exchange miner excluded focus genuine investor sentiment importantly level sustained accumulation across cohort seen since november president trump period marked sharp uptick bullish sentiment price momentum saw bitcoin claim given accumulation psychological boost renewed whale interest market observer could increasingly confident bitcoin poised challenge potentially surpass high near future,0.038,0.691,0.271,0.9876,1

Key Takeaways: NFT sales jumped to $574 million in July, marking a 47.6% monthly increase. Buyers are consolidating around high-value assets, with average sale prices hitting $113. Ethereum-based collections dominated the market, fueled by ETH‚Äôs price surge. The figure reflects a 47.6% jump from June‚Äôs $388.9 million, though it still lags behind January‚Äôs peak of $678.9 million. While dollar volume soared, activity slightly cooled in terms of individual transactions. The number of trades slipped by 9% to five million, down from 5.5 million in June. NFT Buyers Shift Toward Premium Assets as Average Sale Hits $113 Notably, the average sale value rose sharply to $113.08, the highest level in half a year, indicating a shift toward higher-value purchases. A notable trend in July was the shrinking pool of buyers. Unique buyers dropped by 17% to 713,085, while unique sellers climbed 9% to 405,505. The data points to market consolidation, with fewer buyers acquiring more expensive NFTs, while sellers continue to offload assets into the rally. Overall market sentiment remained bullish. NFT Price Floor reported that total NFT market capitalization reached $8 billion, a 21% jump from its July 24 figure of $6.6 billion. Ethereum‚Äôs rally also played a role. The cryptocurrency surged past $3,900 in July, gaining over 62% since early August 2024. At press time, ETH remains above $3,800. The strength of Ethereum helped lift valuations across NFT collections built on its network. All of the top 10 NFT collections by market cap in the past month were Ethereum-based, with CryptoPunks leading in total value traded at $69.2 million. Pudgy Penguins followed closely at $55.5 million, while Polygon-based Courtyard NFTs ranked third with $23.8 million. Pudgy Penguins showed the most notable growth among top-tier collections, posting a 65.44% increase in floor prices, outpacing even blue-chip names like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club. #NFT sales rose to $574 million in July, the second highest in 2025. cointelegraph pic.twitter.com/tm6HCokSks ‚Äî Nehal (@nehalzzzz1) July 31, 2025 Ethereum dominated NFT blockchain activity with $275.6 million in sales for the month, up 56% from June. Bitcoin and Polygon followed with $74.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively. Cardano posted the largest percentage growth at 102%, while Solana recorded a modest 8% rise. On the downside, Polygon‚Äôs volume slipped 51.1%, and BNB Chain saw a 54% drop in sales. NFT Lending Market Crashes 97% as GONDI Surpasses Blur The NFT lending sector has collapsed from nearly $1 billion in monthly volume in January 2024 to just $50 million in May 2025, a staggering 97% decline. Borrowers and lenders have largely exited, average loan sizes have dropped by over 70% , and confidence in the space has eroded, according to DappRadar. Loan durations are shortening too, with the average now at 31 days, reflecting a more cautious lending landscape. Notably, in recent months, DraftKings , GameStop , and Bybit have all shut down their NFT platforms, with Bybit citing a steep decline in trading volumes in its April 8 announcement. X2Y2 has also revealed plans to wind down its marketplace by April 30 to pivot toward artificial intelligence.

Here's the Latest Research!","As quantum computing becomes increasingly prevalent in our lives, it is reportedly a significant threat to Bitcoin (BTC). It is being argued that quantum computing could one day undermine the cryptographic foundations that secure trillions of dollars in crypto assets. According to Decrypt, Mysten Labs has conducted new research on quantum computing and cryptocurrencies, saying that some blockchains are more unprepared and vulnerable than others. Mysten Labs, the developer of the Sui blockchain, said that their new blockchain is better prepared to face quantum threats. Mysten Labs said that new research shows that blockchains that use the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) are in a better position to deal with future quantum threats. At this point, new networks such as Sui (SUI), Solana (SOL) and Near (NEAR) are more reliable against the quantum threat, while older blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) are in a more vulnerable position. This is because older blockchains like BTC and ETH use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which faces greater technical and operational hurdles in transitioning to quantum-resistant security. Mysten Labs noted that chains using EdDSA, such as Solana and Sui, are easier to upgrade for quantum resistance. Kostas Chalkias, co-founder of Mysten Labs, stated that governments are well aware of the risks posed by quantum computing, as Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury strategies have increased recently, saying: Governments around the world have issued mandates phasing out classic algorithms like ECDSA and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) by 2030 or 2035. It also means that if your blockchain supports sovereign assets, national cryptocurrency treasuries, ETFs, or CBDCs, and if your community values long-term reliability and mass adoption, you will soon need to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards.‚Äù Finally, Chalkias added that Bitcoin and Etheruem will also eventually need to upgrade their algorithms to transaction-secure quantum-resistant algorithms. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-31 10:32:01,49310905,1753957921,"BlockDAG‚Äôs BEAT VESTING Pass Offers Immediate 3,025% ROI on Launch Day; PEPE Price Chart Flashes 40x Rally & UNI Weakens","The PEPE price chart is lining up like it has before past rallies, pointing to a potential breakout that could turn $0.000011 into $0.0004. The Uniswap (UNI) price analysis, meanwhile, reflects fading strength, with prices slipping under channel support and risking a move toward $10.20. Both rely on perfect timing and cooperative charts. BlockDAG (BDAG) doesn‚Äôt. Its BEAT VESTING pass gives early buyers full liquidity on launch day, converting a $0.0016 presale price into a mapped 3,025% ROI once BDAG lists at $0.05. The window closes August 4. While other projects wait for setups to trigger, this one is turning early entry into an immediate day-one opportunity. PEPE Price Chart Points to Potential 40x Rally This Cycle The PEPE price chart shared by analyst @CryptoELlTES has traders anticipating a major breakout for the meme coin this cycle. The chart highlights a consistent ascending channel, where PEPE repeatedly bounces from the lower boundary, signaling steady accumulation. If momentum builds, a breakout above the channel‚Äôs resistance could send PEPE from its current $0.000011 level to nearly $0.0004, marking a 40x jump. This setup mirrors previous rallies shown on the PEPE price chart, where similar rounded bottoms led to strong upward moves. As long as the structure holds, traders believe PEPE may be on the verge of its next explosive run. UNI Price Analysis Shows Weak Momentum Below Key Support The latest Uniswap (UNI) price analysis highlights a breakdown from its ascending channel, signaling a loss of short-term bullish strength. After rejecting the $11.60 resistance, UNI slipped below the lower boundary of the channel and is now testing a compressed EMA support zone near $10.53. Despite holding above $10.48, buyers show weak conviction, and RSI remains neutral at 49.64. Unless UNI reclaims $10.60 with volume, this Uniswap (UNI) price analysis points to a potential decline toward $10.20 or even $10.00 in the near term. BEAT VESTING Extended Until Aug 4: Early Access to 3,025% ROI on BlockDAG! BlockDAG has announced that its BEAT VESTING pass is making a brief return due to overwhelming community demand, giving participants one last chance to bypass standard vesting schedules. The pass allows holders to unlock their full allocation immediately at launch instead of waiting for gradual releases. With BDAG set to debut at $0.05, this could be the fastest route to a 3,025% return for anyone entering at today‚Äôs $0.0016 price under the GLOBAL LAUNCH Release. Presale interest has already crossed $356 million, with over 24.5 billion BDAG sold across 28 batches. The price has surged 2,660% since the first round, yet this temporary offer keeps access fixed at its lowest possible rate. The difference is timing: while standard entries will see their BDAG unlocked in phases, BEAT VESTING participants can trade, reinvest, or compound their position immediately from day one. With over 200,000 unique holders, demand is accelerating toward launch. Analysts now predict BDAG could reach $1 in the short term and potentially $10 or even $20 over time, making it one of the top crypto projects to tap into right now. The BEAT VESTING pass is live only until August 4, and once it closes, the option disappears. This creates a sharp contrast: those who act now could start trading on day one at launch prices, while latecomers will be waiting through scheduled vesting periods as the market moves. Top Crypto Projects Right Now Crypto markets rarely move in a straight line, and this week highlights just how varied the ride can be for top crypto coins. The PEPE price chart is drawing attention as traders speculate on a potential 40x rally if its established accumulation channel finally breaks upward. Meanwhile, the latest Uniswap (UNI) price analysis shows weakness below $10.60, signaling a possible slide toward $10 if buyer conviction doesn‚Äôt return soon. While these top crypto projects wrestle with the market‚Äôs usual swings, BlockDAG is offering something few projects can match: certainty on timing. Its BEAT VESTING pass, open only until August 4, gives early buyers immediate launch-day liquidity on a presale already past $356 million. In a space ruled by speculation, this may be one of the few predictable opportunities left.
